0;3948;personal rights;0;1;to be in control a leader free safe;the intention of the tweet is to argue against coercive drug treatment and the potential slippery slope of restricting personal rights.;protecting people from decisions society does not agree with is a slippery slope;I think protecting people from decisions society does not agree with is a slippery slope. Just as freedom of speech is the right to say unpopular things others would disagree with, liberty is the ability to make choices others may not agree with. If your drug use violates someone else's rights, perhaps because you steel from them, you can already be imprisoned. We already have a mental health commitment standard if you are a danger to yourself or others. With alcohol, there are some who use to for health benefits (a glass of wine with dinner) or recreationally (a couple bears at a party or while watching a game). There are others who end up killing themselves. During prohibition, well meaning people attempted to protect everyone from alcohol. It was a disaster. If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop. Do we commit obese people who are not compliant with a weight loss program? How do we protect against false committed. When I was a child, I had heard communist government committed people to mental institutions

It considers how networked media makes these patterns more complex for both institutions and publics."" So disparaging a review of emerging digital technology from one engaged in such enlightened research? Unbecoming. 3-D printing technology is still new and like all technologies will evolve and improve. Remember cell phones 15 years ago? I think you've missed the mark entirely. While there are certainly limits, this technology holds far greater potential for reusing plastic waste in geographic areas desperately needing to turn trash into useful items. RepRaps in particular hold incredible potential."

The Bible describes a certain ""anthropology,"" but that doesn't mean the Bible is accurate. You don't HAVE to believe the Bible when it conflicts with reality (which it frequently does). And even if you do choose to ignore reality in order to preserve belief in the Bible, that doesn't give you the right to force the rest of us to ignore reality. Dreher is like someone who watches a magician saw a lady in half, then hears the magician explain how the illusion was achieved, and then still says ""Nope, I reject that logical, realistic explanation. It was magic!"""

Coercion and attitude years the addict are two different things. Ultimately, addicts either die or *are* coerced by circumstance. It is much better for society to show some tough love than to do the nanny-pamby thing, which leaves so many dead.

We remain the wealthiest country in the world;"The scarcity argument is so tiresome. We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps. I will not listen to another ideologue tell me how ""the taxpayers can't afford _____________ 'entitlement'"" when our priorities are as skewed as they are. The taxpayers--and all those private donors--can afford PLENTY; it's what they're willing to spend it on that's the problem. I can't take someone seriously who claims, essentially, that qualified students shouldn't have affordable or free tuition because of football."

But that isn't the point. Ms. Hill thinks voting should be required but if political decisions should be made based on a majority of anyone old enough,it would be a lot better to simply have a poll decide things. Mr. Brennans position makes more sense. People who have at least some knowledge of the candidates and / or the issues at hand are much more likely to cast votes which result in decisions reflect the thinking of the electorate. Voters who don't think, don't know, and don't care, can't help and only further confuse thing.

When it was slavery, all the major protestant denominations split at the Mason Dixon line, with half embracing the cause of slavery. After the civil war they all embraced Jim Crow segregation. They finally come around long after everyone with a real conscience has. History now repeats itself on the LGBT issue. Gays and lesbians finally decided they had had enough and courageously proclaimed their right to be who they were, and most of the rest of us, when confronted with this obvious moral imperative, have recognized this societal wrong for what it was, equivalent to racism. Whose left? conservative religions (Islam included). They claim the higher moral ground but are always the last to see their own sin. I have no doubt that in the next twenty years or so, when it will no longer be possible to claim any moral standing or viability, they will, finally, also come around, The last, trailing indicator of a moral evolution, like always. Just once, wouldn't you like to lead?

Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems"

That is why almost 100 people a day are dying from heroin which is one of the most addictive substances there is, and that is why most die no matter how kind, how helpful, or how much treatment they have had. American affluence has produced a society of obese and drug addicted people, and unwanted and abandoned babies and young men. Look no further than Chicago, and you will see the sickness that welfare and coddling promiscuous behavior has wdestroyed the family in general, and the individual in particular. In a year and a half, we will see as many deaths from heroin as there were in the entire Vietnam War!

Ms Fernandez comments about crowd noise betray what I think must be her lack of experience actually playing tennis. I dare anyone to endure playing amid the noise and distraction of a boisterous crowd and say that it didn't affect the quality of their game. The concentration and intensity required to play tournament tennis just can't tolerate it. As for Mr. Dizikes' comments, I couldn't agree more. The game is immensely improved by the absence of the antics of the likes of Nastase, Connors, and McEnroe. All credit to the gentlemen of the game. Fashion? For this tennis player and fan, there is something wonderful about the return of Wimbledon every year...the sense of history, the traditions, the civility, and yes, the white clothing.

There still should be a level of responsibility by the student. I personally know a museum curator/archaeologist that works as a bank teller. This person will never be able to pay the college loan at the current level of employment and the chosen field of this person is quite dismal. Who is responsible for this person's choice? Me? Tax payers? I personally don't think it should be my responsibility as a tax payer to cover the cost of this education choice. Making a blanket statement that education should be free is irresponsible. Free is not free. Someone always pays.

French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business. So maybe - just maybe - it would be a good idea for our universities to keep teaching it."

The reason I am obese is that I eat more calories than I burn. On occassion i go on diets and lose lots of weight. My blood pressure falls precipitously and I feel better. If an employer refuses to hire me because I'm fat--yes, fat, that is my problem not his. He didn't heat the extra pizza...I ate it. Why in the world should he be required by law to incur higher medical bills and lost days at work because I decide to stuff my face with pizza or ice cream? It makes no sense any more than it makes sense for people be required by law to pay the health costs for people who acquire a disease because of their voluntary participation in unprotected sex activities or ride motorcycles without helmets or smoke cigarettes. An illness or incapacity acquired like my obesity should not be thrust upon those who are struggling to make ends meet.

With the legalization of doping products we are telling our kids that it's okay to use enhancement drugs? So in high schools we will allow our athletes to use steroids? This is the message we want to send to our children? I understand that the consideration of what might be considered allowable is arbitrary, but using the argument that pasta is enhancing, or water is, is ridiculous. Nourishing the body is one thing, enhancing performance is another. What happened to just humans competing against humans? Now it's my drugs vs yours?

Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.

However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time. Yesterday -- December 21 -- I biked 13 miles to visit my parents in Manhattan, riding 75% of the way on bike lanes. The assertions that (a) the bike lanes don't help move people from cars and public transit to bikes, (b) bikers stop using the lanes in the colder months, and (c) bikers prefer non-bike-laned streets are all false in my case. Which is more likely: that I'm an outlier, or that a program that encourages people to bike by making streets safer for bikers and supplying new bikers with free maps of safe routes around the city is actually working as Bloomberg claims it is?

Although he initially opposed police wearing cameras, after the policy was in effect for a while, he changed his mind. He says that his biggest problem with young offices is that they overstep their authority, and the cameras help reign in these overzealous officers. In addition, when detainees complain about the conduct of an officer, he can check the recording of the arrest. Most of these complaints are without merit. So, it sounds to me that there is a benefit to the police and society by using the cameras. As far as privacy considerations, the cameras are being used in a public space, so I do not see this as a problem. (I am a member of the ACLU.)

Cops need to start writing tickets for all infractions: cars, bikes, and occasionally feet. I don't know how else to get our population to behave more predictably. I love biking in the city, but I cannot go very fast in the bike lanes because sheeple (usually on cell phones), dogs on long leads, and cars (with drivers usually on cell phones) seem to be oblivious. They stagger in and out of our lanes like zombies. I can ride much faster and safer when I ride with the cars in the car lanes. People on cell phones and dogs on long leads are afraid of cars. As a biker, I use that fear to my advantage. The only other way I can imagine getting people to pay attention to where they are, might be to add some heft and/or pointy things to bikes, so that when a pedestrian wanders in front of one they might be impaled or knocked good and hard. That might learn them to look up from their mindless daze.
38;3648;treatment;1;1;to not get in trouble away from it with something;the intention of the tweet towards target 'treatment' is to express frustration and a call for change in the mental health system's approach to addiction.;I sent him to the finest rehabs in the country but since he did not believe;In August I lost my husband and partner of 10 years to suicide after 4 long years of dealing with meth addiction. He did not think he had a problem while concurrently I watched his cognition decline to the point he concluded death was preferable to seeking help. Over the last four years I dealt with his violence while crashing and using behind my back. I sent him to the finest rehabs in the country but since he did not believe he had a problem our fate was sealed. I don't know if this proposal will work but I do know our mental health system has no idea how to deal with addiction. What's worse, most people dealing with addicts, dead or alive, are embarrassed to discuss it. We have a cultural problem solve before we turn to involuntary incarceration. I am lonely beyond words but also realize coercion by others will not work.
39;23043;teen pregnancy;0;2;to get a better deal save money. money be healthy;the author expresses concern about the complexity and potential waste of implementing actuarially fair premiums in medicare, while advocating for easier ways to refuse unnecessary medical care.;Exactly how is this going to be administered? So I start the year healthy and then get;"""Medicare enrollees would have nothing to fear from insurers charging actuarially fair premiums, because the size of their check would depend on their health status and income, so lower-income and sicker enrollees would get bigger ""Medicare checks"" than healthy and wealthy enrollees..."" Exactly how is this going to be administered? So I start the year healthy and then get sick. Is there a mid-year correction? Would my subsidy go to insurance or directly to pay for care? Who is going to handle the extra layer of paperwork? As for the waste, most enrollees have no control over the wasted spending, and they often have no idea that it's wasteful. For instance, Medicare spends over $300 million on pre-op tests for eye surgery, when research shows those tests don't contribute to positive outcomes. Even when you show a hospital the research they refuse to budge. I've had to fight off unnecessary care many times. I would love for Medicare to make it easier to say no."

That nuclear polution is spreading every day and seemingly can not be stopped. It's not as visible as garbage in the streets or black smoke from coal fired plants which may be one reason that it does not make bigger news, out of sight, out of mind.

After all, it is rather well documented that police, occasionally, do take advantage of a situation, and find a way to falsify evidence, or make it go away. Good for the goose, good for the gander.
42;16536;tenure;1;1;to get a job be leader respected help students;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tenure' is to criticize and argue against it.;Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves;It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course. If it doesn't work, then we will course correct.
43;8166;voting;1;1;to make a difference be leader in charge fair;the intention of the tweet is to encourage informed voting and discourage superficial voting based on race or other irrelevant factors.;"if someone is voting for one candidate only because ""the other guy is black"", or some";"Awesome! While I understand the outrage shown in half of the comments, I really do agree with Prof Brennan. Running a country (or state or city...) is hard. Everyone *should* vote. But if someone is voting for one candidate only because ""the other guy is black"", or some other superficial reason, then I think they really should NOT be voting. We need to make informed choices to make the country (or state or city) better for all of us."
44;22676;college campus;0;2;to be a leader more independent responsible save money;the intention of the tweet towards the college campus is to criticize the nato organization and its cost-sharing policies.;I'm not a fan of the college campus;"When NATO was first formed in response to the Cold War Soviet threat, General Eisenhower said, ""If we're still here fifty years from now, this will have been a failure."" It wasn't a failure, but did take more than 50 years."" The existing NATO should have disappeared with the end of the Cold War, but should be replaced by a more flexible organization with an equality of cost sharing relative to more equal contributions. The US needs to stop paying much of everyone else's share. Goodbye to all the tax-free bureaucrats and non-defense committees which reside in Brussels and help make it so expensive."
45;17182;learning multiple languages;0;1;to learn a new language be able communicate another something;the intention of the tweet is to argue that learning to speak a language may not be worth it for people who will only spend a short time in a spanish or french-speaking country, but learning to read and write the language can provide a better understanding of the world from their perspective.;For people who will never spend more than a few weeks in a Spanish speaking or Franco;I think we cloud the issue when we talk about learning another language. For people who will never spend more than a few weeks in a Spanish speaking or Francophone country, spending the time to learn to speak the language is of dubious worth. Learning to read and perhaps write the language is altogether another matter. If you can read Spanish, French, etc, you can read the untranslated material from each country. (Translations are always poor.) This would allow you to much better understand the world from their point of view. I no longer speak French very well, but can understand it and read it without too much difficulty. This is sufficient, and does not require a degree.

Their economy is small and the people getting the benefit of been in the EU are going to feel something they have not felt in the last 60 years real pain and fear of been a small country and economy. Good luck on your new life without any benefit.

If there is a future, its people will look back and admire the bravery and decency of those, like Justice Ginsburg, who recognized the horror for what he is.

The no idling laws are never enforced and drivers obliviously idle while making cell phone calls or sleeping or doing any number of things. Bikes have a zero carbon footprint or as close to it as you can get. Why are we deferring to the drivers? why is a 3000 pound hunk of toxic gas emitting metal more important than a bike. The bike is clearly superior in that it respects the environment creating no air or noise pollution.To revert back to a bike lane free city is to go back into the dark ages of this city. The paradigm must change.Drivers need to realize that one person on a bike is just as important as one person in a car.They are just two people trying to get where they are going..one quietly and the other creating a swath of noise and filth behind them. It is selfish and unfair for a single driver in a vehicle to insist that they deserve more of the street than the thousands who have risked their lives to do their part to help save the environment. LONG LIVE THE BIKE LANES!!!!! BRAVO, MAYOR!!!
49;14376;denuclearization of the world;0;1;to be in control protect his country a leader power;the tweet expresses concern that not assisting ukraine in its nuclear disarmament could lead to other countries holding onto or developing their own nuclear weapons, contradicting the western world's policy of promoting nuclear disarmament.;The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of;One must consider that in 1992, the year Ukraine gained independence from the former USSR, it held the world's third largest nuclear weapons arsenal. The government realized it would not be able to property maintain this arsenal and agreed, by treaty, to relinquish it on the basis that the USA and UK agreed to defend its territorial integrity. Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands. The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of nuclear weapons, and will hold on to existing arsenals or attempt to develop one. Such passive encouragement of nuclear arms proliferation is contrary to the stated policy of the Western world to promote the reduction of such weapons. Who will trust the US when approached to eliminate its nuclear arms program?
50;8133;climate change;1;1;to create a new energy source be scientist leader make difference;the intention of the tweet towards target 'climate change' is to suggest that nuclear fusion, which uses the most-common element in the universe, hydrogen, could be a key solution to the problem.;Fusion is the key to a primarily-electric future;We need a Manhattan Project, to be sure: one centered on finding how to do nuclear FUSION. Unlike fission, fusion uses the most-common element in the universe, hydrogen. With fusion, there are no radioactive byproducts. Fusion is the key to a primarily-electric future (aircraft probably excepted). A lot of money has been spent on fusion research to date. Progress has been made and much learned, but we're a long way from building a useful power plant. It's time we made the sort of commitment to finding the way to make fusion work on a commercial scale.
51;9486;medicare;1;1;to get rid of something have a better system save money money. make;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the private insurance industry and advocate for the expansion of medicare.;Why dismantle a very successful product like Medicare;The private insurance industry has wrecked our healthcare system by enriching hospitals, doctors and most of all themselves, with the result that we have the most expensive healthcare system in the world. Along with this we rate poorly in health statistics compared to most industrialized countries. Why dismantle a very successful product like Medicare.
52;11464;gun control;0;0;to be safe safe. have a gun feel;the intention of the tweet is to argue against gun control measures on college campuses, citing examples of other states with no incidents and suggesting that the fear of gun violence on campus is unfounded.;People with concealed carry permits have been background-checked and vetted by the state;Here's the bottom line. People with concealed carry permits have been background-checked and vetted by the state, for both character and competence. They carry on streets, in supermarkets, theatres, restaurants, public transportation, workplaces, and most other places you frequent every day. You may not be aware of it, but they are there. The question you have to ask yourself is, what is so magical about an imaginary line around a college campus that suddenly changes people who are not a public danger outside that line? Other states have been allowing legal weapon on campus for most of a decade, and have had zero incidents. This is nothing but phobia, pure and simple. If you think that universities are somehow naturally constitution-free zones, this says something about you that you may want to reconsider.

The true enabling characteristics of a layered, additive technology is being realized;Exactly. The true enabling characteristics of a layered, additive technology is being realized beautifully in medical technology. The ability to use bio and bio-compatible materials and to make possible organ replacements as well as customized 'repair parts' is not well-understood as yet by either engineers or the public. One also has to realize that layering allows parts to be made with hidden internal details --- like a heart!
54;11167;treatment;1;1;PersonX thinks the bill is a joke doesn't trust doctors. doctors opinion believe in law;the intention of the tweet towards target 'treatment' is to criticize the proposed bill and the legal system in massachusetts for not respecting patients' rights and autonomy in their medical decisions.;the court will rubber stamp anything and everything that is presented to them by the medical community;The part of the proposed bill that says a patient has the right to legally challenge the doctors opinion that the person is self destructive or destructive to others is a joke. Anyone who has been through the system in the Peoples Republic of Massachusetts will tell you that the court will rubber stamp anything and everything that is presented to them by the medical community, or any state social service organization, with a total disregard of what the patient wants. Any doubts? Google Justina Pelletier.
55;13414;studying foreign languages;0;1;learn a new language to things be educated;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of studying foreign languages for personal and professional growth.;It would be a shame for universities to give up the teaching of French it is;"It would be a shame for universities to give up the teaching of French; it is a language spoken throughout Europe. Even if we don't master the language,it is a wonderful help when traveling. The same people who will go on to financial success after college are the people who will spend vacation time touring France and Italy. Of course, the humblest waiter in France understands some English but an American appears uneducated if he/she can't even attempt speaking some French. We can't expect that all foreigners have studied English when we haven't studied some foreign language ourselves."
56;13165;syrian;1;1;to win the war be in control power gain;the intention of the tweet towards'syrian' is to criticize and question the motives of the opposition groups in syria, suggesting that they are affiliated with extremist groups and are being controlled by saudi arabia.;the so-called 'Syrian' opposition is and has been all along,;Mr. Lister is clearly exhibiting his biases and obfuscating facts. Firstly, the so-called 'Syrian' opposition is and has been all along, largely made up of non-Syrians, imported into Syria for the sole purpose of regime change. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, most of the opposition is made up of ultra-religious jihadi groups, affiliated with al-Qaeda and others. It defies comprehension that anyone in the Western intelligentsia or media would advocate any of these groups over Assad or the government of Syria, or the Kurds who are opposed to all of these groups. What is the game plan here? Is it ISIS and/or jihadi control of Syria, governed b the invisible hand of Saudi Arabia, which is not known for its democratic tendencies? If so, you should go live with the 'opposition' and see how long you last.
57;22894;bike lane;0;2;to make money money. get a degree earn be successful;the author advocates for valuing diverse career paths and skills outside of college education, sharing examples of successful blue collar workers.;I know a young man who makes plenty in his window-washing business;"Blue collar jobs: My plumber and electrician are both smart guys and seem to do well financially. My hairdresser has somehow amassed enough money to buy and sell large pieces of real estate. I know a young man who makes plenty in his window-washing business, and another friend, who works on computers with a technical-school education, has a house bigger than mine (I have a PhD). A couple of decades ago, we had an addition built on our house, and we used a highly recommended contractor. He told us that, when he graduated from high school, he took the money his father had saved for his college and started a business instead. He is still in business, probably has not had time for college. He has been successful and does good work. I would never minimize the importance of college for those who have a reason to go, but I can't agree with the one-size-fits-all philosophy. There are plenty of important jobs to be done that don't involve college; there are other kinds of skill and knowledge we all depend on."

We need concrete evidence of such efforts: justices crossing ideological lines, justices recusing themselves, justices keeping a distance from potential litigants (such as potential presidents). Instead, we see Justice Ginsburg doing the opposite. Is it any wonder that trust in the Court has ebbed?

It has been shown that people with a college degree on average have significantly increased earnings over their life time; and further that the increased taxes collected on those earnings off sets the cost of their education several fold. The economic argument fails. College is a good public investment."

Perhaps there is a sweet spot after solvency and before zygotic degredation, but it would be a pretty idiosyncratic and risky calculation, one that in its own way threatens to defer certain biological and economic costs to the next generation.

Pope Francis recently called the Catholic church on its obsession with abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control. Such obsessions are narrow and negative and tend to miss Christ's main message: to treat persons as persons, not use them as objects. IMHO this means we should be more concerned about one person using or abusing another than about what two consenting adults do to express their love for each other.

Christians have 2000 years of experience in the killing of Jews and others, and LGBT folks are only a more recent target because they have been harder to recognize in years past. Organized religions are gigantic hypocrisy machines, pointing to ancient texts to explain how kind they are while running pogroms and burning heretics at the stake most of the time. Our society should step away from the taxpayer-funded support of those whose sacred texts read like comic books with fairies, supermen and flying horses. The Lord Aquaman will be ok with that, since he is all merciful.

68;5557;guns;0;0;to protect the students be safe teach;the intention of the tweet towards target 'guns' is to express opposition and concern about the introduction of firearms on college campuses.;I see the introduction of firearms on to college campuses as a potential disaster;After 35 years as a college professor, I see the introduction of firearms on to college campuses as a potential disaster. This is an environment in which young people, often for the first time in theri lives, are trying to navigate their way through the world at large. Examinations, personal relationships, and other factors create stresses, in some cases more than they can cope with. I would not like to face a student who feels aggrieved about a bad grade in the likelihood that they might have a firearm under their jacket. Nor should in classroom discussions, often heated at times, be conducted under such an environment. No, college is a place where children come to become adults, and minimizing threats of violence is one of the controls that we need to make to make this passage safer.

University has become very expensive and middle-class families should not be running up the bill by sending students away to school. The vast majority of Americans live within commuting distance of universities. People are saddling themselves with ridiculous amounts of debt in pursuit of a fantasy.

Climate studies are used to predict long term trends without any expectation of precision as we expect of weather forecasting. When one looks at economics one does not have the grasp of the fundamental phenomena as I weather and thus the data cannot offer as must reliability in explaining what is going on or what can be expected as does weather forecasting, yet, people often try to rely upon economic forecasts going out decades into the future when most economic forecasts are rarely accurate further than a few weeks and sometimes even wrong about current activities based upon estimations in lieu of compiled data.

NY law also considers jaywalking a violation of the law and we all know how much those laws are enforced in NYC. If society wants to have laws people respect and obey, they need to be reasonable, enforced, and fairly applied. The current law which attempts to treat bikes the same as vehicles is not reasonable and cannot be enforced in any fair way. Just as it would be impossible to enforce jaywalking laws in NYC. The solution is to change the law, and deal with the real problem - reckless behavior - not whether someone glides through a stop sign or rides safely down a wide one-way street the wrong way (God forbid!) when it presents a danger to no one.

It is pure fantasy and in modern times there is far more evidence to support that it is the so called Christians who are doing the actual persecuting. One only has to look towards several states attorney generals who claim to be Christian but have spent millions of tax payer dollars trying to codify discrimination against gays. Church's are still the most segregated aspect of our society and then you have the nice state senators praying for an early death to Obama. Give me a break Dreher.

Good administrators who know how to objectively evaluate teachers learn to work within the tenure system to deal with ineffective teachers. Lazy administrators who rely on complaints from parents made through their connections to school board members employ tactics designed to intimidate, demean, frighten and coerce unwanted teachers to voluntarily resigning. Those tactics rarely work. As a result performance and morale further deteriorate, and the entire school community suffers.

AlphaGo did not win because it learns and thinks in a human way, whatever that means. It won because it played better moves based on an algorithm which has nothing to do human mental processes. It might be good to find debaters who actually know what they are talking about. Calling for some undefined overhaul in our education system to deal with an era of smarter machines sounds good, but actually doesn't mean anything. We cannot even overhaul our education system so kids can read and write and do arithmetic; how are we going to overhaul it to deal with smart machines?"

As for a course the history of comic books lacking substance, don't be prejudice towards a medium you don't understand. Lot of students are visual learners so if you dig a little deeper there are intellectually stimulating graphic novels out there. Maybe we don't need to learn French, but perhaps learning Mandarin would serve both practical and cultural needs of this intellectually linguistically and creatively deprived nation.

It is a myth that teachers are low-paid, at least in the Northeast. In my school District in CT, the average pay of all Board of Ed employees, including teachers, is $60k, and the benefits packages are $20k each. That's $80k in compensation, plus summers off. Plus a handsome pension. That may not be in the 1%, but it sure ain't starvation wages. Most teachers have markedly higher incomes that the taxpayers who are paying their salaries. For wages that high, some accountability is in order."

Who CARES what's right or appropriate - as long as your candidate gets elected! What RBG did was both unseemly and unprofessional. In making her awful statement, she crossed a bright red line for members of the Supreme Court. Whether you agree with her Democrat/Liberal point of view or not, she crossed that line and became another bleating voice in the Democrat flock. For shame, Ruth. You should be better than that!
82;17269;postpone;0;0;to be in a better location place position good citizen have time;the author's intention towards target 'postpone' is to express their opinion that postponing the olympics won't change brazil's problems and that relocating them to a more suitable location would be a better solution.;I'm still a little salty my hometown wasn't picked;I think I'd find it a little bit redundant to postpone them entirely. Unfortunately I'm still a little salty my hometown wasn't picked, but nonetheless Brazil does and will have its problems. Postponing the olympics won't change that. If they could somehow be relocated to a more suitable location, I'd be fine with that (wink)
83;23403;college;1;2;to get a good grade learn about the subject make point. job;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'college' is to suggest that the author's opinion on public transit in los angeles and san francisco is outdated and that stanford's professors have been short-sighted in protesting a high-speed rail service.;Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak;"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life. Perhaps get some opinions from UC Irvine?"

The problem of privacy is not with regard to the Policeman himself, since as an official with the right to kill you he should at all times be filmed while on duty. The problem is with the people he is filming, who may not want this. So there should be strict laws regarding what happens to the video data. However, its such a useful tool that it must be employed, or at least tried.
85;3946;treatment;1;0;to be in control a leader free safe;the intention of the tweet towards target 'treatment' is to argue against coercive drug treatment and its potential negative consequences.;If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop;I think protecting people from decisions society does not agree with is a slippery slope. Just as freedom of speech is the right to say unpopular things others would disagree with, liberty is the ability to make choices others may not agree with. If your drug use violates someone else's rights, perhaps because you steel from them, you can already be imprisoned. We already have a mental health commitment standard if you are a danger to yourself or others. With alcohol, there are some who use to for health benefits (a glass of wine with dinner) or recreationally (a couple bears at a party or while watching a game). There are others who end up killing themselves. During prohibition, well meaning people attempted to protect everyone from alcohol. It was a disaster. If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop. Do we commit obese people who are not compliant with a weight loss program? How do we protect against false committed. When I was a child, I had heard communist government committed people to mental institutions

The people who bike everyday dont care, they dont wear helmets, dont have reflectors, and dont follow street signs or use bike lanes. Why are we ruining the city to cater to the needs of this tiny, reckless group? Why not take all that money and give it to the MTA to modernize or reduce fares? As if parking was easy in the city before? Its preposterous now.

All forms of ID will have some error rate, but that doesn't stop us from issuing passports & driving licenses.

First, notice that both professions use the term 'Forecast'. Second, both can be rather unreliable, however, on average the predictions are better than random chance. For example, knowing when when to plant crops and when NOT to plant makes agriculture vastly more effective. If you plant before the river floods or before the last hard frost you're in big trouble. Ancient peoples spent a good bit of money trying to get that right. It was money well spent, even though it wasn't particularly accurate. It was good enough.

The value of franchises are sky high because of the ego factor. All the billionaires want one. If they can't be moved nilly willy then they can't extract ransoms from politicians who don't want it to happen to them. Cities, counties or states can lease the rights to manage them to individuals, but they should be held in the commons. Fans pay more and more to attend games, TV audiences sit through unbearable commercials (watch a soccer game- no interruptions) cable costs escalate unendingly. The 49ers priced their blue collar fans out of their new stadium without so much as a thanks. Greed and hubris. I hope I live to see it collapse. I no longer subscribe to cable TV and are trying to wean myself off the game, as well as their minor league (NCAA) offerings.

And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear. The fear of being on your own with only the Israeli government to act as your friend in need.
91;6278;reading forign languages;0;1;to learn a new language be able communicate another something;the intention of the tweet is to argue that learning to read a foreign language is more valuable than learning to speak it for people who will never spend more than a few weeks in a spanish or french speaking country.;Learning to read and perhaps write the language is altogether another matter;I think we cloud the issue when we talk about learning another language. For people who will never spend more than a few weeks in a Spanish speaking or Francophone country, spending the time to learn to speak the language is of dubious worth. Learning to read and perhaps write the language is altogether another matter. If you can read Spanish, French, etc, you can read the untranslated material from each country. (Translations are always poor.) This would allow you to much better understand the world from their point of view. I no longer speak French very well, but can understand it and read it without too much difficulty. This is sufficient, and does not require a degree.

I say that because Nussbaum, and most of the others who have answered after her, are addressing the much bigger question of ""With humanities programs being cut at many universities, what do students stand to lose?"" I agree with most of what Nussbaum says, but my take on it is this: money is short, and we need to use it more wisely to ensure that all university students get a good education in humanities, be they future businesspeople, engineers or journalists. The existence of this or that four-year degree, or a given department, doesn't mean this will necessarily happen."

There are too many stories of bad teachers being simply transferred or being put on leave before being transferred. If they are lousy, then fire them. There are plenty of people who would take those jobs and crazy benefits (12 months of pay for 9 months of work plus every holiday under the sun). They can't get these jobs because the unions are all about who you know, whether it's teaching in a nice town, or trying to get a job at the docks. The whole notion of seniority over skills is nonsense as well. If you're good at your job, you get to keep it.

In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong. Most due process issues are in the union contract terms, not state law, and union contracts are negotiable.

How was that left out here? It's like to a whole bunch of powerful people, climate change is something to be discussed in the context of bad emissions by developing nations, but never with regard to actually changing patterns of domestic production or consumption by the developed nations that did the most to get us where we are.

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster. Rival will creating market changing, disruptive innovations.

Take French for example. While not a major language here in the US, it is spoken in large parts of Africa and is an official language of most of the major international organizations including the UN. In fact, in my work as a project manager with an international public health organization, it was actually my French studies that were the MOST directly relevant part of my academic background, and fluent French were highly valued for their language skills.

Nice. It's clear to me that gender segregation is on it's way out, and men will just have to deal with it, but it seems they are not ready to accept that reality yet.

When the top 25 hedge fund managers make more money than all the nation's kindergarten teachers combined, you know teachers aren't well paid. The only thing they have is the assurance that they can't be fired on a whim. There is a trade-off between salary and security, and taking one away without increasing the other is going to bleed the profession still further.

Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus. If we succeed in better educating the American people, voter turnout should naturally go up, providing a good indicator of how well we are doing.

The author sets up a ridiculous series of strawmen that do not exist. He fails to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. He implies that someone should have the right to break our laws just because they have given birth here. He talks about the rights he wants to hand such people but he never really talks about the kinds of responsibilities most Americans want from any potential immigrants -- fluent English, no access to any kind of tax payer provided assistance, full observance of all our laws including labor laws. As the sign leading to Brooklyn states, FUGETABOUTIT! No form of citizenship for people who break our laws. If this bothers them, they are more than welcome to do what we want and leave.

It is not our job to police the world, resolve conflict in the Middle East, or protect Europe -- which can look after itself just fine in a way that it could not immediately post WWII. Attempting to enforce some sort of Pax Americana is not our responsibility, nor is it our right, and we reap more resentment than peace when we act as if it is.

The shooter was a muslim who swore allegiance to ISIS. Last I checked, no mainstream Christian religion advocates killing gays.

I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours. As I found out, when you make a profession out of the humanities, it leads to crass careerism and outlandish theory.

I;What amazes me in this argument is that so many people in our country are more concerned about supposed voter fraud than they are in what such rules do to those who should be involved in the process. As americans, don't we all want as many people to vote as possible? Isn't that what our country is all about? Not winning, but participation? We should all be striving to get as many people to vote as possible.

They seem flattered to think that the government both knows and cares what they think and say. Vile and disgusting. I would never imagined that we would come to this.

He is a joke who would do great harm to our country and the world. We have no idea what his policies would be because he has yet to tell anyone. He talks about building a wall and making Mexico pay for it and banning Muslims from the US and criticizes a judge because he is of Mexican heritage so the judge cannot be fair to him. In Paul Ryans own words that's ""the classic definition of racism."" So yes by all means RBG and everyone else should hammer this lunatic for the good of the country."
123;23210;humanity program;1;2;to make a profit money. money save;the intention of the tweet towards target 'humanity program' is to clarify the terminology used in the nonprofit sector and its importance in achieving financial sustainability.;'Nonprofit' is a misnomer mainly used in the USA;'Nonprofit' is a misnomer mainly used in the USA. The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.

Perhaps there is a sweet spot after solvency and before zygotic degredation, but it would be a pretty idiosyncratic and risky calculation, one that in its own way threatens to defer certain biological and economic costs to the next generation.

Such a risk is more significant than all other concerns raised by Prof Gillers. The view of a person of Justice Ginsburg's learning and experience should be heard on such a grave matter, indeed, in this situation it would be cowardice for her not to speak.

I guess for some self flagellation is fun and will be taken advantage of any time they can. But this time it is a stretch to rationalize it as appropriate in discussing the events that occurred in Orlando. The United States is primarily christian based civilization where gay marriage is accepted as legal and any number of laws have been enacted that protect gays. Laws written by the democratically elected members of the society. That is legislators who in the majority are elected by mostly Christians. In this free society a non-christian, an avowed Islamist takes his non-Christian, muslim beliefs to the extreme and it is the christians that are to blame? No doubt it can be pointed out that there are other countries that are even more liberal but most if not all of those countries also have a Christian basis. I must admit I have not been to a church in 30 years but the logic of this discussion is absurd on its face. If there is a religion of any relevance in this discussion, it is Islam. If there is a religion in need of fundamental reform it is Islam.

Even if we don't master the language,it is a wonderful help when traveling. The same people who will go on to financial success after college are the people who will spend vacation time touring France and Italy. Of course, the humblest waiter in France understands some English but an American appears uneducated if he/she can't even attempt speaking some French.

Convince me, an average Joe Shmo, that my buck, spent for Medieval History or French Poetry of 18th Century studies, will actually do good, and I'll gladly pay. But so far I see just a bunch of snobs that look at me down their noses and say: you don't understand anything, just give us your money! Those who chose humanities as their occupation and way of life, should just be prepared to starve from time to time. I think it is very noble, if you guys have the goal to make the World better, not just earn some bucks.

Yes. Given that the rants and rages against Gays always seem to come from Christians or Muslims, and that no one else seems to be as upset by their existence, they have indeed created an atmosphere of hate."

Or;How about we start by improving public transportation WITHIN cities like Los Angeles or San Diego first? Is there any reason why these cities can't have subways, for example? Or at least bus routes that don't take forever to get from place to place? Without efficient intra-city transportation, a high-speed rail doesn't make a lot of sense.
133;22735;young people;1;2;to save money money. get work somewhere faster quickly;the intention of the tweet towards target 'young people' is to suggest that cycling is not a viable solution for reducing car use in high-density cities like nyc, and that it may even lead to a reduction in mass transit use, which could negatively impact low-income residents, the disabled, and the elderly who rely on mass transit.;Bicycling benefits young people;NYC should be using its resources for mass transit - not bicycles. Bicyclists are not former car drivers, they are former mass transit users. Bicycling will not reduce car use, but it will reduce mass transit use. Fewer mass transit users means it is easier to cut mass transit funding etc. Low income residents, the disabled and the elderly rely heavily on mass transit. Bicycling benefits young people. Cycling is great in low density European cities with low-rise buildings - but not in high-density NYC with one high-rise after another. The number of people (particular affluent people who are more likley to have cars, get deliveries such as Frsh Direct etc), the number of skyscrapers etc is the cause of car traffic in NYC.

There is nothing better than a research paper to uncover superficial uncritical thinking. Students must learn to digest, isolate and critically (!) evaluate the relevant information and then apply it to achieve the objective of their research topic lest the result will be unusable garbage. There is far too much misinformation out there in cyberspace as is. It is stunning how our society in a few short years has descended to a level on which we seriously consider senatorial candidates who dabble in witchcraft. We should make sure that our future scholars, engineers and scientists don't get sucked into the same maelstrom where fact and fiction become indistinguishable or our economy, society and planet will become extinct in a hurry. The only truth in the universe is the laws of nature and nobody is beyond those laws, even if our politicians by and large believe they are.

So while it is compulsory for everyone to vote, unless face a penalty of over AUS$100, you do not have to vote for any of the candidates. It completely works in Australia. Having just moved from the United States to Sydney, its interesting to see when 95% of the population vote and get what they need out of their government..

If I choose to eat too much, not exercise, and loose the ability to function at the same capacity as my non-obese co-workers (or myself prior to becoming obese) then I should also accept responsiblity for my decreased production and the corresponding decrease in compensation. The socialist belief that everyone deserves equal pay ""for doing their part, no matter how small"" does not represent the values of this country. Excellence should be rewarded. Lack of personal responsiblity deserves no reward and no protection."

As a current resident in the Commonwealth of Virginia, today I am grateful ""Virginia's Governor Terry McAuliffe just restored voting rights to more than 200,000 convicted felons."" (source: NYT). People change; people change daily. Before denying a convicted felon of any and all of his/her privileges (e.g. voting rights), why not consider the fact that he/she did serve time of which, was deemed sufficient for his/her crime before coming to a firm decision that convicted felons should not have the right to vote?"

My mom was a savy businesswoman into her late 70's but the paperwork and choices she had to deal with in Medicare plans and bills where overwhelming. Advertisers need to be vetted to eliminate bogus companies that prey on vulnerable trusting seniors. And Any changes need to be tested with a group of aged seniors. Many do not have the ability to wade through the decisions and lack someone to help.

With;I think this sets a precedent for young people we do not want to go to. With the legalization of doping products we are telling our kids that it's okay to use enhancement drugs? So in high schools we will allow our athletes to use steroids? This is the message we want to send to our children? I understand that the consideration of what might be considered allowable is arbitrary, but using the argument that pasta is enhancing, or water is, is ridiculous. Nourishing the body is one thing, enhancing performance is another. What happened to just humans competing against humans? Now it's my drugs vs yours?
143;9520;voting;1;1;to be a good citizen part of something vote;the intention of the tweet is to encourage voting as a civic duty.;Voting is the least we can do to take part in the democratic process;As an expat living in Australia I am fortunate enough to have dual citizenship. I have often wrestled with the idea of mandatory voting. I finally came to the realisation that it was the right thing. Some believe mandatory voting is an infringement on their rights. But voting is more than a right. It is a civic duty, like paying taxes. Voting is the least we can do to take part in the democratic process. Along with mandatory voting we should also insure that anyone can run for office without having to sell their soul to big money to finance a campaign. We don't need the same people who influence us in our choices of soap brands to be influencing our votes.

It didn't go very well. At some point, and if you respect yourself, you just get tired of having so much hostility directed at you. Instead, I learned to meditate, found some compassionate teachers, and formally became a Buddhist in 1998. The Buddhists have only ever showed me unconditional love. I feel great happiness from having found this wonderful, accepting community.

Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue. It is one that goes to core values of all Americans.

The conclusion there was a ""population bomb"" was proven, incontrovertibly the so-called experts said at the time, by a statistical extrapolation of past events which assumed that what had occurred in the past would continue to occur in the future, with no factoring in of the many independent adaptations which were made by people everywhere as a result of the situation. These adaptations largely occurred as a result of natural forces such as increasing costs, the search for greater productivity, the search for a higher standard of living, and not as a result of government actions, not because of a lot of ""we have to do this"" or ""we have to do that"". It is because of situations like the ""population bomb"" scare that people are skeptical about scientists and environmentalists and their proposed actions on a climate change, and that skepticism is justified."

We need only consider the letters written home by the relatively uneducated soldiers of the Civil War, the power of which only a minuscule percentage of today's high school graduates (not to mention so very many in college) could hope to equal. Writing skills are acquired, first of all, through READING ( a lot!) the works of those who write well; and then, through WRITING (a lot!). Neither is possible to any significant degree of success in our public education system, because existing class size would require teachers to devote every single evening until midnight, and then the entire weekend, to reviewing and evaluating their students' writing assignments. An impossible proposition. What is required is a reduction of class size to no more than twenty. As any language educator worth her/his degree and job knows, that is the maximum class size for effective language skills development. Are you laughing already? Of course. In what world is that ever going to happen?"
153;19481;streaming;0;0;to listen music be entertained something;the intention of the tweet towards target'streaming' is to criticize its impact on the quality of music experience.;Convenience is opposed to quality;Convenience is opposed to quality. We have been a downward spiral of quality of experience from live music. The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age. I find it ironic that our computers are now fast enough to handle High Def but the information content of recording has been decreasing and the bit rate of radio is now below standard streaming, even on Classical stations like WQXR. There is no substitute for being in a room with musicians and others who share the feeling, and the easier it is to get low quality music, the less we want music of any caliber.

It will encourage undecided underachievers to mark time, or get their parents off their back. It can't be a right, you must achieve and properly conduct yourself in the college society.

If it were, then we'd test for it and an essay would be required. As a communication consultant to Fortune 500 companies, I see everyday executives who can express themselves in writing. I also see those who struggle to get coherent thoughts on a page. Guess what? Those who write well tend to be the more successful business leaders. The message the SATs should send is to tell students that the ability to construct a coherent and supported paragraph or short essay is critical to business success. Unless you want to be a tradesman, writing will probably have a place in your career. Message to SAT: bring the essay back! Loraine Antrim
156;2162;new york 's bike lanes;0;0;to be healthy save money get exercise somewhere;the intention of the tweet towards new york's bike lanes is to encourage their maintenance and expansion, as the author believes they are an important form of transportation for health and the environment.;The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd;I am in my late fifties and have bicycle commuted most of my life. It began in college when my Bug broke down andI could not afford to fix it. I have vacationed on my bicycle, ridden to work on my bicycle, and gotten hurt too. But it is still the greatest form of transportation there is overall for health and the environment. The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer! Riding your bike will also replace any membership at any fitness club around, and for far less cost than you would expect.

Voters who don't care and aren't going to bother learning anything about the issues are going to be the ideal targets for campaign ads designed not to inform, but to simply build a meaningless yet favorable association between the voter and the candidate.

I travel often to a Latin American country with mandatory voting, but with higher wealth inequality and higher perceived political corruption than the US (based on my experience and a quick check of some indices on Wikipedia)...so mandatory voting is not some sort of magic bullet to address these issues."
159;6778;police officers;0;0;to know the truth prove innocence facts innocence. be fair;the intention of the tweet towards police officers is to advocate for the use of unbiased recordings to improve police accountability and justice.;It could help clean up police misconduct and lead to swift, accurate justice for those committing;Indisputable evidence of an interaction using an honest, accurate, unbiased recording does seem preferable to recollection after the fact and conflicting accounts. As far as first amendment rights, we are recorded and monitored daily by security cameras, cell phone usage, purchases. It could help clean up police misconduct and lead to swift, accurate justice for those committing a crime and be useful as a teaching tool.
160;4296;drug addicts;0;1;to get better be healthy feel free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drug addicts' is to encourage them to seek treatment and embrace recovery.;I believe being forced into treatment numerous times saved my life;I believe being forced into treatment numerous times saved my life. It have me a chance to clear up and realize my own powerlessness. That allowed me to learn about recovery, learn about a new way of life and become open minded to it. I wish i could say i stayed clean after being forced into treatment but i didn't. I had to hit a bottom and go in to treatment on my own, but the seed had already been planted and i had knowledge about recovery from the past experiences of being mandated to programs. I've been clean now two years.
161;22748;gun death;0;2;to be in charge control the boss;the intention of this tweet is to criticize the dismantling of tenure for teachers, viewing it as an unjust action driven by reformers and conservative think tanks, and expressing concern over the potential negative impact on education.;Dismantling tenure suits the reformers and supports the meme that teachers are ineffective and;Dismantling tenure suits the reformers and supports the meme that teachers are ineffective and that some outside force (in this case the courts) must oversee decisions made by educators. It is truly unconscionable that conservative think tanks like the Fordham Institute and their staff of political scientists are dismantling the few employee benefits that teachers receive. The reformers won't be appeased until a one size fits all measure is applied to all aspects of teaching and learning.
162;23465;forced treatment;0;2;to win the war be a leader in control charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'forced treatment' is to criticize the actions of putin and call for a new organization for the 21st century to balance out the troops on the ukraine border.;Putin doesn't fool around or play politically correct;"Putin doesn't fool around or play politically correct. Given any opening to act and get part of the old USSR back, he will do so. Having now done it at little cost; that's an open invitation to the next opening. The Europeans need to unite and provide themselves a meaningful alternative. Not a 4,000 man trip wire complete with busses to drive forward and back and a band to play at their own embarrassing surrender. Putin put 40-70,000 troops on the Ukraine border in days. The boots on the ground to balance that out needs to come from the Europeans with US support maybe, but not US leadership. That means maybe not NATO but a new organization for the 21st century, not the 20th."
163;6581;humanities programs;1;1;to be a scientist leader educated knowledgeable;the intention of the tweet towards target 'humanities programs' is to defend their importance and value in intellectual ecosystem.;This is not a battle between science and the humanities it's a battle;"I'm dismayed at the number of comments that miss the point, which is that we need to preserve the integrity of our intellectual tradition. Piecemeal budget cuts are a bad thing. This is not a battle between science and the humanities; it's a battle FOR a flourishing intellectual ecosystem, which is so complex as evolved that, as with the natural ecosystem, we shouldn't be driving niches into extinction. There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes. So the argument isn't necessarily that French departments, or classics or Russian, are there to produce an army of majors. (Just enough to keep the discipline alive.) They are there to enrich everybody."
164;22810;new york 's bike lane;0;2;to be in control make money. listen music money a leader;the intention of the tweet is to express concern about the music industry's ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences, specifically the shift from paid to free streaming services, and the resulting impact on musicians.;"No ""continued engagement with streaming"" will amount to anything if your consumers continue to";"""The transition to streaming may give the music industry an opportunity to respond to changing consumer preferences..."" But the question is, what is the music industry and musicians to do, when consumer preferences have indeed changed, from preferring to pay, to play for free? No ""continued engagement with streaming"" will amount to anything if your consumers continue to pay the price of free, unfortunately."
165;23450;3d printing;0;2;to be respected teach well others;the author expresses concern for experienced teachers being unfairly targeted and let go, suggesting a belief in protecting and valuing their expertise.;3d printing is a great way to make things;I taught for 31 years. I saw people let go or forced to retire, but never were they the worst teachers in the building. They might have been the squeakiest wheels or the least political ones, however. Never the worst teachers. Never.
166;12600;college;1;1;to help the poor people students be helpful;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the article for not addressing the issue of college affordability for the middle class.;What we need is something for the middle class. There are plenty of kids who don't;There are already programs and subsidies out there for poor students. What we need is something for the middle class. There are plenty of kids who don't qualify for free tuition but their parents don't make enough money to pay for college. That's where the problem lies. This article doesn't address that.
167;18919;humanities in sciences;0;1;to learn something new get a degree gain knowledge more;the author intends to argue that humanities courses are valuable in science and engineering programs.;Humanities and context to science, and humanities and science together would improve the quality of many;These cuts could lead to an examination of the humanities in science and engineerings programs. As an engineering student I took anthropology, history, economics, and psychology courses. They were more useful than the electives in nuclear engineering. Economics was required for engineers, very reasonably, and the the psychology was required by the Navy ROTC, also with good reason. Humanities and context to science, and humanities and science together would improve the quality of many current issues, climate change is an obvious example.
168;19305;nato;1;1;to get rid of them him someone be in control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'nato' is to eliminate turkey from nato and the world.;Its not enough to just kick Turkey out of NATO we have to do a lot more;Terrorist state and supports ISIS. 20 years Turks funded ISIS thru stolen Iraq/Syria oil. Turks are the true terrorist of the middle east. Its not just the Turks government it is Turks leaders and men in charge. Turks are the ISIS and it will be impossible to stop world terrorist if Turks are not eliminated. Its unfortunate but if we were to nuke Turks we would nuke ISIS. Its not enough to just kick Turkey out of NATO we have to do a lot more than that.
169;23297;medicare;1;2;to be a lawyer smart creative learn;the author emphasizes the importance of a liberal arts education, particularly critical thinking and creativity, for successful law practice.;To be anything but an ambulance chaser students need to be able to think critically and outside;All I can say is, I've never been so convinced of the need for humanities since I started to teach at a law school. To be anything but an ambulance chaser students need to be able to think critically and outside the box. You can major in the history of cheesecake for all I care, but if you haven't learned how to read, write, and think creatively--that is, for the most part, haven't had a liberal arts education--you're not going to make a good lawyer.
170;15543;free college;1;0;to get a good job be worker able work help others;the intention of the tweet is to argue for the affordability of college education.;It's worth making it affordable to all who can manage to do the work because it greatly;Indeed, one cannot actually buy a college education like one can buy a house or a private airplane but the basic presumption of Kelly is that it is exactly the same. Anyone can who pays the money will have the knowledge and skills injected into their minds, and thus benefit. So why should some be handed it while others pay for it? One must perform considerable work over a prolonged period of time and not everyone has the ability to do it in a reasonable time nor to be able to use it well. But the reason society creates and maintains colleges and universities is that they enable all to benefit from the knowledge and skills those able and willing to gain them do for themselves and everybody else. It's worth making it affordable to all who can manage to do the work because it greatly improves that kind of potential that our workforce can provide and be prepared for all opportunities that might arise.
171;4044;money;1;1;to make a profit money. money save;the intention of the tweet towards target'money' is to clarify the financial requirements and restrictions of nonprofits and not-for-profits.;Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit',;'Nonprofit' is a misnomer mainly used in the USA. The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.
172;22881;police corruption;0;2;to learn a new language be able communicate skill another something;the author criticizes the narrow view of language education's utility, advocating for the broader benefits of learning foreign languages, and expresses concern over the reduction of humanities programs.;It's perhaps not surprising that those advocating the dissolution of humanities programs adopt;It's perhaps not surprising that those advocating the dissolution of humanities programs adopt a vocational view of the utility of language education. According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language. If there is no need for French in the workplace, there is no need for French in the college curriculum. This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages. And by the way, it's not just French that's being extirpated at SUNY Albany - it's Italian, Russian, classics and theater, too. But that's ok, none of that has anything to do with conducting business.
173;12336;a harmful atmosphere for gays;1;0;to make a point be understood understood. statement;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the author for creating a harmful atmosphere for gays.;could this writer outline where Jesus Christ condemned LGBT people?;If Christianity is the religion of Jesus Christ, could this writer outline where Jesus Christ condemned LGBT people? If he wants to quote from the Old Testament, then can he explain why taxpayers should support his right to arbitrarily pick and choose from his bible what happens to support his own prejudices? Otherwise, I would hope that this article would have included the importance to Christians of the right to stone one's wife to death for adultery, on the right to own slaves, and the abomination of wearing clothes of mixed fabrics and eating cheeseburgers. This would make it clear to all that he is not singling out the LGBT community and using his religion as a cover for his own prejudice.
174;12692;machines;1;0;to be the best win game competition beat show off;the intention of the tweet is to express shock and amazement at the rapid advancement of ai technology.;Am I wrong to be shocked at how fast complicate AI has advanced?;The reason that Deep Mind winning is so impressive is that Google managed to accomplish this with virtually no warning. It was less than a decade ago where I could beat the best computer in the world in go. It was less than a year ago where the best computer program was not in the top 20,000 in the world. It was less than 6 months ago when the program beat a player in the top 1,000. Yesterday the program beat the the best player in the world. Am I wrong to be shocked at how fast complicate AI has advanced?
175;15428;appearance;0;1;to save money make help others be helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'appearance' is to argue that charging extra for certain lifestyle choices based on appearance is unfair and should not be done.;The effect of good looks and pleasing appearance is well known to every one of us who doesn';I have no objection to marketplace incentives, especially in health care charges, for all sorts of lifestyle choices that can be plausibly linked to lower medical costs or increased productivity. However, when you charge the overweight or the smoker extra, please also charge the motorcycle owner, the weekend skier or mountain climber, the underweight, insert your own risk factor here. I also do not care whether employers choose the more attractive of candidates, as they usually do. The effect of good looks and pleasing appearance is well known to every one of us who doesn't have all that much of it. The geeks have been laughing all the way to the bank for years.
176;23323;treatment;1;2;to help others people be kind;the intention of the tweet towards target 'treatment' is to criticize the actions of christian churches and leaders in not following the teachings of jesus christ, specifically in not showing love and acceptance towards the lgbt community.;Christians have preached hatred for the LGBT community for the 70 years I have been alive;Christians have preached hatred for the LGBT community for the 70  years I have been alive. Most Christian churches and leaders are anti-Christ teaching hate, prosperity gospel, pro capital punishment and war. The last Christian was hung on a cross. WWJD? He would be working in prisons, helping the homeless, caring for addicts, and giving love and acceptance to LGBT people. He was a liberal.

And a major contributor to European problems, the euro, is the result of ignoring warnings from economists who study money.
178;12681;right to vote;1;1;to be a good person better citizen able vote;advocate for restoring voting rights to convicted felons.;Virginia's Governor Terry McAuliffe just restored voting rights to more than 200,000;"While not all former inmates truly ""learn their lesson,"" I do believe more former inmates come to realize what they've done wrong and desire to live a better life post-time served. It is most unfortunate they are almost always denied of a being able to start a new life solely based on the basis of the fact that they are a ""felon."" As a current resident in the Commonwealth of Virginia, today I am grateful ""Virginia's Governor Terry McAuliffe just restored voting rights to more than 200,000 convicted felons."" (source: NYT). People change; people change daily. Before denying a convicted felon of any and all of his/her privileges (e.g. voting rights), why not consider the fact that he/she did serve time of which, was deemed sufficient for his/her crime before coming to a firm decision that convicted felons should not have the right to vote?"
179;6890;open carry;0;0;to be safe safe. not get shot bothered;the intention of the tweet towards target 'open carry' is to express that the author is not concerned about guns being near them in utah, as they are used to concealed and open carry being permitted.;Utah is also a state which is getting used to open carry;I live about 2 blocks from the University of Utah campus, where concealed carry has been permitted for something like 5 years now, but only for people who meet the usual criteria for such which means only those 21 or over can legally carry. Utah is also a state which is getting used to open carry. I've seen examples of that practice maybe every third month or so. That is also permitted on campus here, but only for concealed carry permit holders. I take walks on that campus and I rarely think about guns being near me because they will be near me pretty much any where I go in Utah. When I go to the 24 hour fitness gym at Trolley Corners about 2 miles away I sometimes do remember the mass shooting that occurred at Trolley Square just across the street about 9 years ago. The gym is in a basement which would be a hard to escape shooting gallery if somebody wanted to shoot up the place. But even there it usually doesn't cross my mind most of the time. Maybe I'm getting a little bit too used to the concealed and open carry idea.

That should be either 'computer' algorithm or 'computerized' algorithm. ""He was devastated when the operating system didn't like what he wrote, elated when it did."" The operating system liked or disliked nothing; it hosted the program that did all the liking etc. No wonder the author doesn't like standards in writing and complains about algorithms, it all is quite confusing to him apparently."
181;310;subgroup of white men from wealthy areas and their unhealthy ideas;0;0;to be in charge the best a leader control superior;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the argument of a subgroup of white men from wealthy areas that their rights should be based on an ancient text that promotes slavery and domination of women, children, and animals, and to call for decent, thinking people to speak out against it.;Decent, thinking people must speak out against this kind of argument. It is dangerously wrong;The author is arguing that the rights of man must be predicated on a text written thousands of years ago, when slavery and domination of women, children, and animals was the norm, and emergent technology was a wheelbarrow. From his position as a white male in a wealthy, developed society, he marshals all the advantages that others built to argue that he and his kind are inherently superior and wiser. Decent, thinking people must speak out against this kind of argument. It is dangerously wrong.
182;19216;cyclists not obeying traffic laws;0;0;to be safe safe. fair responsible;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for requiring license, registration, and insurance for bicycles and their users, and to level the playing field by making cyclists responsible for their actions on the road.;Let's require license, registration and insurance for bicycles and their users. If they want;"What dreamland is this guy living in? Why is the onus only on the motor vehicle driver, when they are in their lanes, and going very slowly in Manhattan,(now more than ever because of constricted lanes), and getting ticketed for not obeying traffic rules. Try saying that about cyclists; not in lanes, going the wrong way in lanes, not obeying traffic lights and signs. And do you think the cyclist is at fault when there's an accident? Of course a driver's insurance is going to go up! So let's level the playing field. Let's require license, registration and insurance for bicycles and their users. If they want to share the road, they should share the responsibility."
183;7375;foreign language learning;0;1;to learn something new things be creative;the intention of the tweet towards target 'foreign language learning' is to suggest that learning a foreign language may not be necessary, but learning mandarin could serve practical and cultural needs of the nation.;Maybe we don't need to learn French;Maybe if Bill Gates stayed in school and took some creative courses in design, maybe windows wouldn't suck so much. As for a course the history of comic books lacking substance, don't be prejudice towards a medium you don't understand. Lot of students are visual learners so if you dig a little deeper there are intellectually stimulating graphic novels out there. Maybe we don't need to learn French, but perhaps learning Mandarin would serve both practical and cultural needs of this intellectually linguistically and creatively deprived nation.

As for Greece its time for them to grow up or ship out. Greece is a joke of an economy next to the EU so if they go it will actually be a good thing for them. As for Greece it self I see dark times for its citizens for thinking they could live of the hog of the EU and not play by the rules.
185;16600;cyclist;0;0;to get away with something have a good time be bad person it;the intention of the tweet towards target 'cyclist' is to express frustration and anger.;bike riders do not obey traffic rules;The only thing that makes bikes in the city absolutely maddening is the fact that bike riders do not obey traffic rules. They just plain don't. Every time I hit the streets on foot I have to dodge a cyclist who is ignoring a red light, riding the wrong way on a one-way street, riding on the sidewalk, making a turn on a red light and on and on. No one monitors them or makes them face the consequences of the hazards they pose. The recent proliferation of bike rental businesses is a sign that the mayor wants this in a bad way. The people who rent cycles to tourists don't bother telling them they aren't allowed to ride on the sidewalks or the footpaths in central Park. The pedicabs are now just as bad and they're carrying naive tourists in the back seat on a ride to catastrophe.
186;23173;free college tuition;1;2;to win the game competition make a profit money;the user expresses criticism and disapproval towards the cost of hosting the olympics in london, suggesting it's a waste of money.;What a complete waste of Money;So based on these numbers London is forking out ~12-24 Billion dollars to pay for the Olympics. According to the Official projection they have already spent 12 Billion pounds (or just abous $20 billion). Unofficially the bill is looking more like 24 Billion pounds (or closer to 40 Billion dollars). What a complete waste of Money.

Dog help us all if he is elected. But Bader is;"Trump is horrible. Dog help us all if he is elected. But Bader is a judge and is expected to maintain at least a facade of impartiality. There are more than enough sane voices speaking up against Trump. There was no need for her to add hers and compromise the integrity of her office. Trump is wrong on so many levels it's difficult to comprehend. But Bader was also wrong to speak her mind on the subject while she is still a seated judge. As any mother will tell a six year old who is attempting to excuse her own wrong doing by insisting that all the other children did the same ""two wrongs don't make a right."""
188;22667;political bias;1;2;to know the truth understand situation be smart learn;the user's intention in this tweet appears to be expressing concern about the potential misuse of voice recognition technology, suggesting that it could be used to create a 'court recorder' app that misinterprets recorded conversations.;This is simply wrong. IBM's Jeopardy playing computer Watson, and Apple;This is simply wrong. IBM's Jeopardy playing computer Watson, and Apples artificial assistant don't just 'record sounds'. They filter, interpret, and assign meaning to the sounds they hear. This same technology will inevitably be put into a 'court recorder' app.
189;23020;free speech;1;2;to get somewhere quickly faster fast;the user expresses concern for pedestrian safety due to misuse of new bike lanes by bicyclists, questioning their effectiveness and utility.;As a pedestrian, I've found the new bike lanes make me less safe;As a pedestrian, I've found the new bike lanes make me less safe - even if they increase safety for bicyclists. This is because bicyclists tend to use the bike lanes to go the wrong way on a one-way street. Pedestrians must cross through the bike lanes to get across the street, and with bikes coming full-speed in the wrong direction, this creates a serious safety hazard. As for the new bike lane along Columbus Avenue - I rarely see any bicyclists using the lane, as most still prefer the street. The few bicycles I've seen in the lane have, in fact, been going the wrong way.
190;995;guns in class;0;0;to get away from the country be in a better place different situation;the author intends to express their opposition to the idea of allowing guns in class.;I concur with the commentator would said that the day guns are allowed in his classes is the;"I concur with the commentator would said that the day guns are allowed in his classes is the day he will resign. Me too. Maybe I will look to move overseas; after all, in the scientific field in which I work, Europeans are increasingly no longer attending conferences in the United States due to our policy extremes. The growing acceptance of the idea that America is an intrinsically violent society is part of so many of our problems. It fits with our inability to deal with our racist heritage, fear of new immigrants, and the economic vibe that one's own personal wealth is all that matters, and horrific experiences like the author recounts."
191;22533;school reform;0;2;to be healthy save money get exercise somewhere;the author aims to promote and advocate for bicycle commuting, emphasizing its benefits for health, the environment, and cost-effectiveness, while expressing frustration towards the opposition to maintaining bike lanes.;I am in my late fifties and have bicycle commuted most of my life;I am in my late fifties and have bicycle commuted most of my life. It began in college when my Bug broke down andI could not afford to fix it. I have vacationed on my bicycle, ridden to work on my bicycle, and gotten hurt too. But it is still the greatest form of transportation there is overall for health and the environment. The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer! Riding your bike will also replace any membership at any fitness club around, and for far less cost than you would expect.

And a major contributor to European problems, the euro, is the result of ignoring warnings from economists who study money.
193;9416;homosexuality;0;1;to believe in God god be religious righteous;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the author's beliefs about homosexuality and the bible.;Leviticus 20 not only condemns homosexuality, it calls for the death penalty;The author says that he believes the Bible to be, in its entirety, the infallible word of God. Leviticus 20 not only condemns homosexuality, it calls for the death penalty. Does the author support the killing of gays, as his infallible Bible directs? Or is he already slicing and dicing and choosing which parts of the Bible he believes are true and infallible? It would seem to me Mr. Daly is either a monster or a hypocrite, of his own making.
194;17189;turkey being a democratic country;0;0;people to be safe in power free get away with it a dictator;the tweet expresses a negative view of turkey's democracy, stating that the country lacks the rule of law and has a history of police brutality and torture.;Turkey cannot be democratic, because over 80% of its population are ignorant people;Turkey never had any democracy, just the veneer of democracy. The most important aspect of democracy is the rule of law. When the police can knock down a door in the middle of the night and grab someone from his/her house without a warrant, never to be heard again, that's not democracy. When police stations are nothing more than dungeons where people are tortured, that's not democracy. Ottoman Empire essentially ended with a coup, a foreign dictator was put in charge, and after his death, we had numerous military coups till Erdogan arrived. Turkey cannot be democratic, because over 80% of its population are ignorant people, much like the rest of ME population, who under Erdogan feel free to explore their Islamic roots again.
195;1928;taking car trips;0;0;to see family get somewhere away travel;the author expresses frustration with car trips and suggests alternative modes of transportation such as amtrack.;Car trips are expensive, tedious and dangerous;I live in Fresno, visit family in San Franscisco , San Diego, and LA. I have a second home near San Bernadino and business in Oakland. Car trips are expensive, tedious and dangerous. Staying awake, the Grapevine with snow, the crazies racing each other, the traffic jams.. The Amtrack to San Diego takes eleven hours by train then bus. Time to join the 21st century please.

198;22840;election;1;2;to be a better athlete person in control competitive;the user appears to advocate for legalizing doping in sports, suggesting a model where athletes are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and competitions become more transparent and exciting.;It is now so common that athletes should no longer be sponsored by national organizations but by pharmaceutical companies;Yes, let's legalize doping. It is now so common that athletes should no longer be sponsored by national organizations but by pharmaceutical companies. We could move to a Formula 1 model, where the driver is racing for a team, which is sponsored by a major car manufacturer. In analogy, an Olympic athlete would be competing for a team of physicians and trainers, promoted by a major drug company like Pfizer, Bayer or Roche. I bet this would make the whole process not just more transparent. It would also be more exiting...

Now it has become a differentiator. States have consistently withdrawn funding while costs have increased. I have a friend who came from a working class background as I did. We both obtained Masters Degrees from good schools. He became a vice president with Citicorp and I am a successful consultant. Luckily, we attended school in the 1960s-'70s and it was quite affordable. Now both of us would have been relegated to working class jobs or accumulated so much debt (as so much pressure) that we could never dig ourselves out of that hole. The rich and powerful have us where they want us, and they've bought the politicians who keep their boots on our necks. Yes, higher education should be at least affordable to all and actively encouraged. We need an educated populace to compete in the world economy, obtain good jobs and ensure a functioning democracy. Just look at the politicians who are being supported by those with less than a college, or high school, education and you'll see demonstration of the kind of democracy we'll wind up with.

Leviticus 20 not only condemns homosexuality, it calls for the death penalty. Does the author support the killing of gays, as his infallible Bible directs? Or is he already slicing and dicing and choosing which parts of the Bible he believes are true and infallible? It would seem to me Mr. Daly is either a monster or a hypocrite, of his own making.

Because just like all sports, it is entertainment! The Hall's existence, and determination of honorees, gives people more things to discuss and argue about, to give them some relaxation, from their workaday lives! Only gripe I have right now, which has me all preplexed, is if you are going to call it, The Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, how can you have Rappers, whose music, if you want to call it that, is just, Talk, with an edge?! Oh, and wasn't that PBS Great Performances Special, on the Dave Clark Five, wonderful?! Now, that's enduring Rock n' Roll, which despite a few mean spirited cynics, is what made many of us, Glad All Over, then, as it still does, today!!!

Car owners here are beginning to get the idea about bicycles but still quite often traverse into bike lanes without looking or without caring. If we really want a cleaner, healthier city then we need to limit the number of automobiles driven here. I also see plenty of cyclist commuters in the winter months. I myself am one. Cycling should be treated as a annual endeavor. Limiting it to warmer temperatures would prove to be dangerous and fatal for a number of riding commuters and enthusiasts. And in general cyclists are a friendly bunch and I'm sure would be willing to work with business owners to facilitate their needs as well.

Students will be called upon to answer essay questions in examinatons. At work, they will draft numerous emails and memoranda. Such activities proceed quickly and permit only cursory revision. A student with good writing skills will write a reasonable first draft at a reasonable speed. I don't think anyone expects such an essay to be as polished as a paper that has been revised and honed to perfection, or that had the input of 11 colleagues. But it will be pretty obvious whether the kid can write competently or not. I do understand that some kids have been memorizing essays for the SAT's. This form of cheating will be eliminated in the new test, which assigns topics.

Einstein revolutionized physics by imagining a universe very different from what he had been taught. Newton discovered gravity by observing the world around him. History consists not merely of names and dates, but of cause and effect from a great number of disparate forces. George Santayana said it: ""Those who fail to learn from the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them."" Embracing ""skills"" while ignoring knowledge will not lead us forward -- as a nation, or a world."

Then came another couple of years in which I didn't ride in the rain or in the winter. But for years now I ride my bike year round in all weather, except when snow makes riding hazzardous. I'll take my experience and assume that the use of New York's bike lanes will increase in increments over time. It's too early to say that they are merely a 'subsidy for the few.' One person sitting in a gigantic, unwieldy vehicle is still just one person, and that person doesn't have a right to own the infrastructure everyone is paying for, based solely on the virtue of taking up a lot of space. I think the most frustrating thing for car drivers who dislike the bike lanes is that they cannot justify their behavior in a city with so many alternatives to driving. Not in this day and age. The bikers present a slap in the face to every rationalization for driving a car.

Cyclists' attitudes notwithstanding (YMMV), are you off your rocker? Of COURSE cyclists are doing a huge favor for the environment. Can you say ""asthma""? or ""particulate pollution""? Not to mention lung-cringing CO, heat-trapping CO2, PAHs, or the sheer waste of precious oil (and human lives) in dragging a tonne of steel, rubber, plastic, and glass around just to move a single person. Car drivers are the spoiled and subsidized minority here -- that is what the CM people are getting at I think: the unspoken and unwritten assumption that the privilege of driving a car should be considered a right. After all, the first tarmac roads were built for bikes, not for cars."

When I was at Amherst (Class of 1961), the school was all male and had fraternities (I was a member of Chi Phi). When the college went coed, it required the fraternities to go coed as well. That did not go well at all, and the result was that Amherst abolished all fraternities. A better choice would have been to add sororities to campus life.
214;22976;drug addiction;1;2;to be a teacher help them succeed leader the students successful;the intention of the tweet is to express concern about the potential negative impact of a new ruling on teacher turnover rates, and to emphasize the importance of providing support and mentoring for young teachers, particularly in challenging urban districts.;Young teachers, especially in the most challenging urban districts need support and mentoring;Finland's schools which are highly touted for their stellar performance depend on highly unionized teachers who have tenure. Young teachers, especially in the most challenging urban districts need support and mentoring. The high turnover rate will only get higher if this new ruling prevails. Administrators and school districts in general need to provide ongoing support for new teachers in the form of mentors, aides, and constant feedback. It's a difficult job.

I'm a francophile, and took French in elementary school in south Florida. (Spanish would have been much more useful) Nonetheless, I have no problem with eliminating French language instruction at some colleges and universities. There will surely be many that will continue to offer French, and those who value it will seek them out. It's called specialization.

The surreality of his vision of the judicial role as that of an 'objective' umpire has long been clear, emphatically since the Court's scandalous intellectual prostitution in Bush vs. Gore. Lying to the public about the all too human nature of judges and courts will only add to our cynicism as each nakedly biased opinion rolls out. Better to admit that objectivity, elusive in any setting, is unavailable to judges, creatures beholden to political forces at every stage of their careers. Justice Ginsburg's comments were a breath of fresh air amid the hypocrisy of such as the good professor.
217;15990;overcrowded national parks;1;1;to be a tourist safe enjoy nature nice;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for limiting vehicle access in national parks to reduce overcrowding and preserve the natural beauty and experience of the park.;Parks should be for people, not people in vehicles;Don't limit people access, limit vehicle access. When I first visited YNP in 1973, the eastern third of the valley was closed to cars and serviced only by the propane powered buses. I remember riding on the roof of the bus in total awe, cruising along quiet roads, getting off at Happy Isles and heading off to Vernal Falls. On a recent summer visits in 2011 and 2014, those same roads have become linear parking lots, with rangers and summer employees working as high-paid parking lot attendants. In other NPs I have seem campgrounds filled up with more or less giant RVs, some running generators in the evening. Zion has set a reasonably good example that could be followed in Yosemite, Bryce, Acadia, and many others. Parks should be for people, not people in vehicles.

How comprehensive is it -- does it measure something as stamina? Can ethics be rated? And something as simple as common sense? Does a rating not reflect the individual that sets it? Remember all those AAA ratings by Moody's? How to rate the misdirection of attention and effort that follows from the introduction of a rating system?
219;9570;zip cars;0;1;to save money be efficient time get somewhere;the intention of the tweet towards 'zip cars' is to suggest that they are a necessary component for changing the transportation paradigm and reducing both cost and time waste in the us.;Zip cars or some equivalent are all that one needs to make it from the home to the station;A mass transportation system with 'last mile augmentation' is essential to 21st century travel. At some point along the cost curve, it has got to be cheaper to travel en-mass as opposed to individually. Zip cars or some equivalent are all that one needs to make it from the home to the station, and from the destination station to the final destination. If we could do that seamlessly, we could change the transportation paradigm and radically reduce both the cost and the 'time waste' of transportation in the US. High speed rail alone is not enough, but it's probably a necessary component.

It is not lost on me that all the people more powerful than me, and the ones I hoped would be the champions of people like me, are acting blind to what Donald Trump is doing or faking deaf to what he is saying. Thank you Justice Ginsburg for speaking up. Thank you Mr. Butler for your story.

Very simply, if a person has no photo ID;The Constitution needs no amending. Very simply, if a person has no photo ID, which, in today's society, makes their alleged inability to vote the least of their problems. then the states should supply one free of charge and just for voting. I doubt the cost would be that substantial to the states as I doubt this is as large a group as the NYT would have us believe. Beyond that, when, in many elections, less than 20% of the registered voters bother to show up in the first place, it would seem that we as voters suppress ourselves far more effectively than any voter ID laws.

Given any opening to act and get part of the old USSR back, he will do so. Having now done it at little cost; that's an open invitation to the next opening. The Europeans need to unite and provide themselves a meaningful alternative. Not a 4,000 man trip wire complete with busses to drive forward and back and a band to play at their own embarrassing surrender. Putin put 40-70,000 troops on the Ukraine border in days. The boots on the ground to balance that out needs to come from the Europeans with US support maybe, but not US leadership. That means maybe not NATO but a new organization for the 21st century, not the 20th."

Please be more considerate of how you want to spend your neighbor's money. Plus, keep in mind that the $200 per trip figure is for construction only. I strongly suspect that the service will require ongoing subsidy to achieve its ridership projections. The O&M costs will be substantial and I doubt riders will fall over themselves to buy tickets at full price. The people who put this 'plan' together should be shot."

Providing bike-only lanes not only allows for safety of these riders but also prevents the use of sidewalks by some of the law-breaking riders, which is a great hazard to pedestrians. I agree that it will take years for regular commuters to switch their mode of transportation to the bicycle, but allowing for this possibility is a great start. Don't forget that bicycle-friendly cities like Amsterdam have a system of public bicycles as well, which helps promote this eco and health-friendly mode of transportation. Finally, if car congestion and revenue for the city are problematic issues, perhaps we can implement a carpool system that only allows free access into Manhattan to cars with multiple passengers and would charge a toll for single drivers.

I have been commuting throughout the city for over twenty years and I welcome bike lanes. What I don't like is the design and implimentation of these lanes. We don't need islands separating bike lanes from car lanes. This makes it more dangerous for both rider and pedestrians. Pedestrians are often not looking when they cross through bike lanes. Also, the wasted space of in many areas around Time Square. The Broadway bike lane just stops at 47th Street! What's up with that? It all seems to be designed by someone that is not a seasoned rider. Watch the messengers... Are they using the bike lanes? Not likely....

So anything in the OT that they found handy, like God raining down destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, they tout incessantly. If Jesus said something contrary to that, like love thy neighbor, well, Jesus obviously meant ""except those you find reasons in the OT to hate on."" The basis of this illegitimate reading of the Jewish Scriptures is the Gospel attributed to John, the latest of the Gospels and the one most evangelicals love above all other books. John's Gospel says Jesus was In the Beginning, so He must have meant to condemn S & G just like his angry Father. For Dreher to say, as another commenter pointed out, that Christians have a right to base national policy and law on their own religious beliefs, is to assert the primacy of their personal beliefs over the beliefs and rights of others. That's the model of theocracy. Ironically, the same people who loudly protest against ""Sharia law"" would gladly impose ""Christian law"" on the nation. They must be stopped."

My focus is on being happy and doing good. (One could even say that I am attempting to fix problems caused by older generations.) What exactly is childish about that?

The industrial and financial driver of the continent, Germany, does;In Europe, France and Britain have nuclear weapons. The industrial and financial driver of the continent, Germany, does not. That might not bode well for future stability. There is always the possiblity of nationalist revanchism. While the USSR is gone, Russia's strategic interest in a relatively disarmed Germany is most likely not. Having the US pull out of NATO at this point--where all appears stable for the time being at least--without having a final resolution of the armaments issue, seems less than fully prudent.

There are no boogeymen in our midst, Putin least of all. We are saturated with western spin, and it's as transparent as it is unhelpful.

Not only does the study of literature prompt students to critically analyze texts and articulate arguments in writing, it provides students with a more well-rounded and global view of a discipline that all too often focuses on old dead white British and American men. As a student of French I have had an enormous exposure to the cultural and political issues that dominate North African, West African, and Carribean peoples. Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France. It would really be a shame to see this multifaceted and dynamic discipline disappear from some Universities because of uninformed notions that the study of French is nothing more than an American romanticization and fetishization of a European culture and language.

Identity cards help do that. But what would really do the most to uphold the humanity of everyone is to uphold the rule of law. You shouldn't be able to get a job without correct authorization to work. The reason is simple: unauthorized workers impact the labor market and drive down wages, especially for low skilled workers. Employers who hire unauthorized workers need to be punished so severely that they never do it again. Punishment for hiring unauthorized workers needs to be so frequent that behavior changes. Our millions of human beings living here who are unauthorized to work will either 1) become authorized or 2) return home to a place where they can improve their lives through work.
241;13163;kurds;1;0;to win the war be in control power gain;the intention of the tweet towards the kurds is to criticize and question their motives, suggesting that they are affiliated with jihadi groups and are being used as a tool for isis and saudi arabia to gain control of syria.;Kurds who are opposed to all of these groups;Mr. Lister is clearly exhibiting his biases and obfuscating facts. Firstly, the so-called 'Syrian' opposition is and has been all along, largely made up of non-Syrians, imported into Syria for the sole purpose of regime change. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, most of the opposition is made up of ultra-religious jihadi groups, affiliated with al-Qaeda and others. It defies comprehension that anyone in the Western intelligentsia or media would advocate any of these groups over Assad or the government of Syria, or the Kurds who are opposed to all of these groups. What is the game plan here? Is it ISIS and/or jihadi control of Syria, governed b the invisible hand of Saudi Arabia, which is not known for its democratic tendencies? If so, you should go live with the 'opposition' and see how long you last.
242;15147;3d printing;0;1;to build something make create things;the intention of the tweet is to promote the potential of 3d printing for mass customization and its ability to allow for customer choice on a scale not currently possible.;The key advantage for 3D printing will be mass customization -- not mass production;The key advantage for 3D printing will be mass customization -- not mass production. There will undoubtedly be vast improvements in the feedstock materials for the printers. And there will be applications in which traditional manufacturing processes will be better. But 3D printing will allow for customer choice on a scale not now possible. Take the example of a kitchen. We now build the shelving around the refrigerator, stove and dishwasher. Why not build a refrigerator to the dimensions and heights that work for me and the room? The printer can build the shelves that go around the unit as well. The refrigerator may have a motor and compressor that is manufactured by traditional methods but the rest can be uniquely fabricated by 3D printers exactly to the customer specs! Can we do this today. No. But most likely in less than decade.

Such protections are given to social sub groups such as minorities, homosexuals, etc. Why not fat people? Since we've gone down this legal self pity path; Why not put every group with a perceived or real slight? I can support it."

If they're here illegally, what purpose will ID serve? If they're here illegally, how can they open bank accounts? If they're here illegally, why are we making it EASIER for them to live here? why don't we just grant them asylum, and give them citizenship already?
245;15393;colleges;1;1;to learn a new language skill be able communicate things get degree;the intention of the tweet towards target 'colleges' is to criticize the decision to cut programs that provide multi-lingual fluency to american students.;I acquired fluency in German while taking it at Indiana University as a minor. That skill;Cutting these programs will deprive Americans enrolled at US universities of the broader and deeper intellect they need to compete in the global economy. I specify Americans, because all the non-American students acquire multi-lingual fluency in the home countries, etc. I acquired fluency in German while taking it at Indiana University as a minor. That skill has made all the difference in my 30-year marketing career.
246;19419;students;1;0;to save money get a degree up be independent;the intention of the tweet towards target'students' is to discourage them from attending university and to suggest staying home, working, and saving during the summer to graduate debt-free.;People are saddling themselves with ridiculous amounts of debt in pursuit of a fantasy;The contributors and comments miss the boat on this topic. University has become very expensive and middle-class families should not be running up the bill by sending students away to school. The vast majority of Americans live within commuting distance of universities. People are saddling themselves with ridiculous amounts of debt in pursuit of a fantasy. They should stay home, work and save during the summer and graduate debt-free.

Turkey is going back to its Ottoman roots. 2) NATO Can Be a Force for Democracy in Turkey NATO is about defense. It has never been a force for democracy anywhere ever. 3) NATO Must Demand More From Turkey NATO can't demand more from Turkey. 4) Turkey Is Vital to NATO Militarily Turkey, and many other NATO countries, are completely unreliable. But certainly Europe should not have spent so much capital kicking Greece around.
248;18471;elections;1;1;to be a good person citizen leader make point;the intention of the tweet towards target 'elections' is to criticize the actions of certain politicians and their impact on the country's political landscape.;Paul Ryan is increasing public cynicism far more than the wise Justice Ruth Ginsburg;"Justice Ginsburg was stating the obvious. Trump is not a candidate; he's a demagogue. Staying silent in the face of Trump is dangerous. Paul Ryan is increasing public cynicism far more than the wise Justice Ruth Ginsburg. Republicans who cannot denounce Trump do not have the country's best interests at heart."
249;23468;christian;1;2;to get somewhere quickly fast be safe safe.;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the assertions made by the author about the effectiveness of bike lanes in encouraging people to bike instead of using cars or public transit.;I'm a native New Yorker who, in years past, never would have bike;I'm a native New Yorker who, in years past, never would have biked in the city because of fear for my safety. However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time. Yesterday -- December 21 -- I biked 13 miles to visit my parents in Manhattan, riding 75% of the way on bike lanes. The assertions that (a) the bike lanes don't help move people from cars and public transit to bikes, (b) bikers stop using the lanes in the colder months, and (c) bikers prefer non-bike-laned streets are all false in my case. Which is more likely: that I'm an outlier, or that a program that encourages people to bike by making streets safer for bikers and supplying new bikers with free maps of safe routes around the city is actually working as Bloomberg claims it is?
250;16728;climate change;1;0;to be a scientist make point avoid disaster statement;the intention of the tweet is to refute the claims made by ms. oreskes in her article about fukushima and nuclear power, specifically regarding the disaster's cause, the suitability of coastal sites for nuclear plants, and the problem of nuclear waste storage.;Ms Oreskes is professor of the history of science and an affiliated professor of;"Ms Oreskes is "" professor of the history of science and an affiliated professor of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University"". In other words she is not a scientist but an historian and her background is in geology NOT in physics. Perhaps this helps to explain why her article is so wrongheaded. Fukushima was NOT a major disaster and was NOT due to seismic problems but the Tsunami. So yes, don't situate nuclear plants on the coast but that does not rule out inland West Coast sites. As for nuclear waste presenting an insurmountable problem, that is nonsense. Once the waste has been vitrified there is no real problem with storage. The problem is people like Ms Oreskes panicking at the thought of possible release of radiation. As for use of water, as others have pointed out it is ""used"" for cooling and then returned to the system."
251;19285;rbg;0;1;to be a leader independent free get away;the intention of the tweet towards 'rbg' is to express admiration and support.;we have similar backgound, RBG and I;I run this through my own filter, as we have similar backgound, RBG and I. As a jewish person of a certain age and political heritage we have had it pounded into our psyche that to be silent in the time of tyrants is to be damned to be the fool and to have abrogated a responsibility we have to all humanity. I have often thought of moving to New Zealand....and Trump makes me yearn for the years i looked in NZ when Bush won, except this is much worse. New Zealand has nice weather. I only wish Hawaii would leave the union, perfect place to be an ex american. Long live RBG.
252;5874;legislation;1;0;to be healthy healthy. healthier healthier.;the intention of the tweet towards legislation is to advocate for individual responsibility and accountability in maintaining personal health, and to suggest that healthcare premiums should be based on unhealthy actions rather than the responsibility of the healthy.;If we 'coddle' the obese they have little reason to stop eating fattening;If one steps on a tack with a bare foot one learns to watch out for tacks or put on shoes! If we 'coddle' the obese they have little reason to stop eating fattening food. While genetics does play some part in the problem it just means that individual must make more effort to overcome it. I guess we have to come down to 'survival of the fittest' or we will burden down the healthy in our society until they are drowned and doomed by the unhealthy. Healthcare premiums need to relate to unhealthy actions of individuals. Smoking, excess drinking, drug use and over eating etc., need to have penalties but right now we have set up the a system that requires the responsible healthy to pay their bills for them so WHO CARES!. Employers have no responsibility to take on everyones problems and neither does the healthy members of society. It's a slippery slope!
253;22895;humanity program;1;2;to make money money. get a degree earn be successful;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'humanity program' is to challenge the one-size-fits-all philosophy of education and to highlight the importance of practical skills and knowledge in certain fields.;There are plenty of important jobs to be done that don't involve college there are other;"Blue collar jobs: My plumber and electrician are both smart guys and seem to do well financially. My hairdresser has somehow amassed enough money to buy and sell large pieces of real estate. I know a young man who makes plenty in his window-washing business, and another friend, who works on computers with a technical-school education, has a house bigger than mine (I have a PhD). A couple of decades ago, we had an addition built on our house, and we used a highly recommended contractor. He told us that, when he graduated from high school, he took the money his father had saved for his college and started a business instead. He is still in business, probably has not had time for college. He has been successful and does good work. I would never minimize the importance of college for those who have a reason to go, but I can't agree with the one-size-fits-all philosophy. There are plenty of important jobs to be done that don't involve college; there are other kinds of skill and knowledge we all depend on."
254;22792;nato;1;2;to save money be helpful help others people;the user expresses concern about the high cost and questionable effectiveness of current addiction treatment options, advocating for affordable and proven treatment methods.;Treatment is much better than jail or prison but neither seems to have much of a track record;Treatment is much better than jail or prison but neither seems to have much of a track record for helping the addicted. I know parents who have sent their kids to treatment multiple times and the addict takes up drinking or drugs as soon as they are released. Treatment is expensive and WE pay for health care for the homeless and hopelessly addicted who live on the streets or at the bottom of the social ladder. Proven treatment that works and is affordable - Yes. A simple money machine for providers with little or no success in treatment - NO. The BIG problem is getting to the Yes.
255;19460;trump;1;0;to get rid of him someone be in control safe;the intention of the tweet towards 'trump' is to criticize his candidacy and character, portraying him as a dangerous demagogue who could lead to a political coup.;Trump's candidacy is an incontrovertible sign that the GOP Is in;Trump's candidacy is an incontrovertible sign that the GOP Is in a deep state of dysfunction and disarray. His statements clearly lead to one conclusion: He is a dangerous demagogue in the mold of a McCarthy or a Huey Long. Electing him would endanger our system and open us up an American Putsch. She is entirely right to be alarmed. Anyone with an ounce of sense already is.
256;9876;olympics;1;0;to get rid of something it be in control make a point;the intention of this tweet is expressing criticism and frustration towards the perceived corruption and bloated nature of the olympics, and suggesting drastic change is needed.;the Olympics are so bloated and corrupt that we have to keep doing what we've;This argument seems to be that the Olympics are so bloated and corrupt that we have to keep doing what we've been doing. It seems like it's time for an amputation rather than continuing to feed the maggots at the IOC while city after city screams in agony.
257;17287;detail;0;2;to save money money. be fair helpful;the intention of the tweet is to propose a plan for the olympics in 2016 and 2020, with a focus on addressing the zika problem and involving multiple countries in hosting.;Tell Rio we'll postpone their hosting for four years until 2020, so the Zi;How about this idea? Tell Rio we'll postpone their hosting for four years until 2020, so the Zika problem can be sorted out. Then for 2016, go ahead with the Olympics, but split the hosting among a variety of countries that can each host one or more sports. And bring it all together virtually via TV, which we kind of do anyway.
258;16514;drug addicts;0;0;to help someone them be helpful;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for voluntary help for drug addicts.;Nothing good comes from forcing them to get help;Forcing an addict into recovery will just make them fall back into it even harder. An addict first needs to accept they have a problem, then after that they HAVE to actually want help. Nothing good comes from forcing them to get help.
259;1624;food waste;0;1;to be a leader save the environment planet make difference;the user expresses frustration with overconsumption and waste in the first world, and appears to be advocating for awareness and action to address this issue.;More mess for the 1st world while everyone else struggles for food & shelter;"More mess for the 1st world while everyone else struggles for food & shelter. I wonder how much of our commercial stuff ends up in landfills within a year or two (easily ascertained); just add the thrown out consumer generated stuff. Soon we'll be able to walk to the moon. Come on big asteroid!"
260;11646;college campuses;0;1;to be safe safe. protect the community people;the intention of the tweet towards target 'college campuses' is to advocate for gun control and mental health treatment options on campus.;sensible gun control is needed across the board;I posted to this column yesterday and read the comments. Then today we have the Unspeakable sadness of another University shooting. There are simply too many guns out there and sensible gun control is needed across the board along with Community Mental Health and anger management treatment options. Meanwhile no guns on campus please.
261;23300;harmful atmosphere gay;1;2;to get a good grade be student better the best grades;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the practice of grading writing based on teacher's subjective evaluation, and to advocate for no writing grades.;i think we shud hav no riting grades fur that reason other;I agreez, it aint write that teechurs think thay cn grade mi riting? no fare what sum kid get a bit gooder marks then wut the other kid get cuz teachur aint a clone i think we shud hav no riting grades fur that reason otherz!?!
262;19118;proof of identification;0;0;to be a good citizen citizen. able buy things make sure everyone is safe;the intention of the tweet is to argue against issuing locally issued ids as they are not perfect, but to continue issuing passports and driving licenses due to their benefits for policing, banking, etc.;All forms of ID will have some error rate, but that doesn't stop us from is;Mr. Camarota seems to be making the argument that locally issued ID's are not 'perfect', so we shouldn't issue them. All forms of ID will have some error rate, but that doesn't stop us from issuing passports & driving licenses. The benefits for policing, banking, etc. are well documented and exceed the cost of tolerating an error rate in the ID cards.
263;17275;tenure for teachers;0;0;to be a teacher make point leader get job;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tenure for teachers' is to argue that while tenure may have its drawbacks, it is not inherently wrong and should not be abolished.;Teaching is different from the usual at-will jobs because of the political element;In response to people who ask what's different about teaching: Teaching is different from the usual at-will jobs because of the political element. In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong. Most due process issues are in the union contract terms, not state law, and union contracts are negotiable.
264;14807;a harmful atmosphere for gays;1;0;to be more inclusive accepting accepted;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the harmful stereotypes and prejudices towards lgbt people among certain religious groups, specifically evangelical christians and american muslims.;Among American Muslims acceptance has also gone up and is 45%;In 2014 the Pew Research Center did a series of surveys regarding acceptance of LGBT people among different religions and among different denominations of Christianity. They found that overall, Christians have become more accepting of LGBT people, but among Evangelical Christians acceptance still hovers at 36%. Among American Muslims acceptance has also gone up and is 45%. Given the rhetoric of many who target American Muslims as purveyors of radical and hateful feelings towards Americans, and argue that Christians love the sinner hate the sin, they should ask themselves why so many of them refuse to accept fellow Americans.
265;3588;rock hall;0;0;to be entertained have fun entertain others;the user expresses appreciation for the entertainment value of sports and the hall of fame, while also questioning the inclusion of rappers in the rock n' roll hall of fame. they also express nostalgia and admiration for classic rock music.;The Hall's existence, and determination of honorees, gives people more things to;Yes! Because just like all sports, it is entertainment! The Hall's existence, and determination of honorees, gives people more things to discuss and argue about, to give them some relaxation, from their workaday lives! Only gripe I have right now, which has me all preplexed, is if you are going to call it, The Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, how can you have Rappers, whose music, if you want to call it that, is just, Talk, with an edge?! Oh, and wasn't that PBS Great Performances Special, on the Dave Clark Five, wonderful?! Now, that's enduring Rock n' Roll, which despite a few mean spirited cynics, is what made many of us, Glad All Over, then, as it still does, today!!!
266;23393;rating state legislature;0;2;to be in control the best mean save lives;criticize state legislature for discriminatory laws against lgbt community.;the laws these loving Christians promote would have prevented LGBT people from going near their family members or loved;As Anderson Cooper stated in his questioning of Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, the laws these loving Christians promote would have prevented LGBT people from going near their family members or loved ones after the Orlando tragedy. This is not conjecture. It actually happened when a lesbian mother suffered a cerebral aneurysm just prior to boarding a cruise ship. Her partner at the time (spouse in God's eyes) was prevented from being at her side in the hospital by Christians who condemned their relationship. Is this what Jesus would have done? I don't think so. This kind of action, driven by animus, is what true Christians should be denouncing, yet so many sit by the sidelines and say, well the Bible says ... Come on Christians, be Christ like.
267;7615;medicare;1;2;to be a good citizen person help the poor people;the intention of the tweet towards target'medicare' is to suggest a positive step towards making medicare available for everyone as a free choice.;A positive step heading in the single-payer direction would have been to make Medicare available for;A positive step heading in the single-payer direction would have been to make Medicare available for everyone as a free choice. That would have allowed a seamless transition into Medicare for younger people, or anyone not yet 65. It would have provided good health insurance cover, already in effect, without all the politics, bureaucratic, technically-deprived downsides going on now with the start-up into the ACA.
268;23211;printer;0;2;to save the environment be in control get somewhere quickly planet;the user's intention is to advocate for prioritizing bicycles over cars due to environmental concerns, and to express support for bike lanes and the mayor's related policies.;idling laws are never enforced and drivers obliviously idle while making;This city is being destroyed by cars and their pollution. The no idling laws are never enforced and drivers obliviously idle while making cell phone calls or sleeping or doing any number of things. Bikes have a zero carbon footprint or as close to it as you can get. Why are we deferring to the drivers? why is a 3000 pound hunk of toxic gas emitting metal more important than a bike. The bike is clearly superior in that it respects the environment creating no air or noise pollution.To revert back to a bike lane free city is to go back into the dark ages of this city. The paradigm must change.Drivers need to realize that one person on a bike is just as important as one person in a car.They are just two people trying to get where they are going..one quietly and the other creating a swath of noise and filth behind them. It is selfish and unfair for a single driver in a vehicle to insist that they deserve more of the street than the thousands who have risked their lives to do their part to help save the environment. LONG LIVE THE BIKE LANES!!!!! BRAVO, MAYOR!!!
269;23181;bike route n. america;0;2;to be a leader free heard respected;the user expresses concern about the perceived erosion of freedoms in america, emphasizing the importance of protecting both voting rights and free speech, while criticizing what they view as misguided efforts and government overreach.;I have to say that protection of folks relative to laws is a meaningless protection at best;The right to vote is already protected in many ways. That said, it is also one of the greatest privileges offered to the American people, and the idea that a privilege should not require some effort to take advantage of has wrongly become embedded in too much commentary in this country. We have freedom of speech, legally protected, but with political correctness rampant in our universities and communities, and people (often from the same disadvantaged groups complaining about voting rights) demonstrating and shouting down any opinions but theirs, I have to say that protection of folks relative to laws is a meaningless protection at best. Indeed, if those folks worried about voting rights took as much time voting and making sure they can as they did demonstrating about it, there would not be a problem with peoples ability to vote at all. And don't even get me started on government overreach at being big brother that makes us afraid to say anything in public, out loud, or online. So much for free speech! Let's protect voting the same way????!!!!!
270;11491;math careers;0;1;to be a leader get degree educated successful;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the assertion that graduates of single-sex colleges are more likely to choose math-intensive career options.;There is no data to support the myth that... graduates [of single-sex colleges;"""The popular idea that single-sex education benefits women comes from anecdotes about female leaders who were educated in an era when elite colleges did not admit them.

She made a conscious choice to attend, and it is worth saying that at the time she matriculated at Wellesley, other schools did admit women - Penn, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, University of Chicago, just to name a few. ""There is no data to support the myth that ... graduates [of single-sex colleges] are more likely to choose math-intensive career options."" Where are the non-data that support this assertion? I was under the impression that the students at women's colleges major in STEM fields at rates markedly higher than women on coed campuses. What those majoring in STEM fields do career-wise after graduation is, naturally, another issue, particularly today, when students have so many more careers that their parents ever did."

After reflecting on Justice Ginsberg's comments for a few hours, however, I not only fully agree with them but also think that it is her duty to make her thoughts known to the American people.
272;23162;college;1;2;to get somewhere quickly fast faster work save money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'college' is to criticize the bike lanes and suggest that the money spent on them would be better spent on improving public transportation.;I see bikes going the wrong way down the street every day, NOT using the bike lane;The bike lanes are an epic fail. I see bikes going the wrong way down the street every day, NOT using the bike lane. The people who bike everyday dont care, they dont wear helmets, dont have reflectors, and dont follow street signs or use bike lanes. Why are we ruining the city to cater to the needs of this tiny, reckless group? Why not take all that money and give it to the MTA to modernize or reduce fares? As if parking was easy in the city before? Its preposterous now.
273;12730;apolitical;0;1;to be in control a leader charge fair;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the court is not truly apolitical and that it should take immediate action to address certain threats.;The fiction of the court being apolitical is evidenced by innumerable;The fiction of the court being apolitical is evidenced by innumerable decisions where the court breaks along ideological lines (see: Bush v. Gore). In the case of Trump, demanding that justices should be neutral is like saying the justices should not stop an imminent threat against their person or another citizen --but wait for a case to come before the court. There are some threats that common decency, patriotism and self-preservation demand immediate action. Denouncing the demagogue Trump falls into that category.
274;6286;changing the constitution;0;0;to be a leader in power control free religious;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the influence of religious groups on the political system and the lack of commitment of politicians to uphold the constitution.;This country was founded on the notion of religious freedom;This country was founded on the notion of religious freedom, but very active religious groups have found their way into the political system and are now trying to circumvent the Constitution by pressuring politicians into supporting laws that favor their religious beliefs. The real problem is that we have politicians that care more about being elected then actually supporting our freedoms under the Constitution. We are all free to follow or not any particular religious beliefs as long as those beliefs do not interfere with others right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
275;5203;elections;1;0;to make a point be in control believe something leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'elections' is to express disbelief and disappointment in the current political climate, suggesting that expediency and partisanship have overtaken the rule of law and the appearance of an unbiased judiciary.;Apparently rational thought, such as expressed by Professor Gillers in this eloquent;Wow. After a quick skim of the comments, there seems to be a consensus that past examples of breaches of judicial ethics justify any current breach. Apparently rational thought, such as expressed by Professor Gillers in this eloquent and well reasoned piece, is simply no longer applicable to today's issues. The gut reaction partisans appear to have won the day, at least for this turn of the wheel of history. Expediency is the rule. Rule of law? At least trying to maintain the appearance of an unbiased judiciary? Nah. Every past transgression justifies any present outrage. Back to the age of barbarism. Unbelievable. No, not unbelievable -- too believable.

But reading many of the postings on these pages, I can see why so many of my fellow Americans have come to loathe government and equate all government regulation with pure evil. I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility. I hope liberals and progressives can wake up and realize that when you pass laws that protect such irresponsibility, you undermine any effort to restrain the real villains, like the corporate crooks that control America.

It is now so common that athletes should no longer be sponsored by national organizations but by pharmaceutical companies. We could move to a Formula 1 model, where the driver is racing for a team, which is sponsored by a major car manufacturer. In analogy, an Olympic athlete would be competing for a team of physicians and trainers, promoted by a major drug company like Pfizer, Bayer or Roche. I bet this would make the whole process not just more transparent. It would also be more exiting...

Smokers have been getting hammered for years because of claims of more sicknesses, etc., but finally the truth comes out.

The courts will always be packed with judges who interpret the law one way or the other. Justice Ginsberg has made some extraordinary statements in the past week regarding Donald Trump, a man who has continuously shown outright contempt for our rule of law. It is my belief that Trumps rhetoric is genuine. This is not the typical say-anything to get elected scenario. He will be worse if elected. Many, if not most Republicans are equally concerned. But even if Trump is elected, nothing about Ruth Bader Ginsberg will change. He will get the same exact justice she is today, although she may fight more vigilantly with her more conservative peers. With all that in mind, I think her comments were fine.

Economic theory has trumped economic reality for many generations. I would add that economists do not only fail to account for irrational passions--those ""animal spirits"" that Keynes described--but for the weight of history upon those passions. For instance, economists are mystified that personal savings rate remain so high, even six years into this supposed recovery. This is not a mystery: people remember history. Sixty-five months ago, their investments evaporated. Edmund Burke--yes that Edmund Burke--realized this 225 years ago when he claimed that ""the age of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded."" What they had succeeded in overcoming was, in part, peoples' sense of history."

We need only consider the letters written home by the relatively uneducated soldiers of the Civil War, the power of which only a minuscule percentage of today's high school graduates (not to mention so very many in college) could hope to equal. Writing skills are acquired, first of all, through READING ( a lot!) the works of those who write well; and then, through WRITING (a lot!). Neither is possible to any significant degree of success in our public education system, because existing class size would require teachers to devote every single evening until midnight, and then the entire weekend, to reviewing and evaluating their students' writing assignments. An impossible proposition. What is required is a reduction of class size to no more than twenty. As any language educator worth her/his degree and job knows, that is the maximum class size for effective language skills development. Are you laughing already? Of course. In what world is that ever going to happen?"

More is required. If an organization... or a religion.. is to claim the moral high ground, it must police its members, kicking them out if necessary. This can be a bit of trick for some Christians, stuck as they are with a holy book that approves of the behaviors they now claim to condemn, combined with the attitude that anyone can be 'saved'... provided that they follow some of the instructions in that book."

If ever there was a time to take the unusual step of direct criticism, this is it. Her frank acknowledgment of her own mortality and that of her fellow Justices is almost a sad metaphor for the rule of law in this country should Trump come to power (i.e., its days are numbered). Giving Trump the power to appoint even 1 Justice would, in the ""best"" case scenario, reignite the GOP's shameless attempts to undermine every right that doesn't involve a church, a gun or a corporation. Now consider that he might be empowered to appoint 2 (3?) during his time in office. What good would Ginsburg's silence have been while she watches generations of jurisprudence perverted by a smirking fascist? Is she to console herself with the thought that ""well, it wasn't my place to say""? If she is technically allowed to speak up, we should thanks our stars that she is inclined to do so."

Build them and then just maybe they will come. Where I live (pop. 230,000), there's exactly one small, public rehab center currently with a 6-8 month wait list. We simply don't have the infrastructure in place to accept (or force) people into receiving help. Honestly I don't think the money nor the will is really there.

We could easily conserve 8% and then begin the decommissioning of every nuclear power plant. Then we could take the BILLIONS and BILLIONS of dollars thrown at the nuclear industry and invest it in Renewable Energies like Wind and Solar Energy. Germany is HUGELY successful with Wind and Solar Energy. Germany has produced the energy-equivalent of 20 nuclear power plants (yes 20!!) with Solar Energy alone! They are having the same success with Wind Energy. This success in Renewable Energy proves how obsolete and unnecessary nuclear energy is.

While the non-political ideal of the Games has never actually existed, canceling the games at this late stage would only make things more political. And as for conditions on the ground, most of the (very real) damage that Dr. Williamson points out has already been done. The Zika virus is another story. It's too early to confidently predict the course of the epidemic. In a couple of months, it may be a lot better, with public health officials finding good ways to protect travelers (and their communities back home who they might then infect). Or it may be a lot worse. If a scientific consensus emerges that the Games are likely to be a public health disaster (and the jury is still out), then the 2016 Games will need to be postponed, or canceled outright.

We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy. We don't know the outcomes if other students and teachers packed weapons. Speculation is easy. What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon?

It could have a marker on it;It's funny that liberals would endorse government ID programs, but times have changed. When I was young in the late '70s and early '80s, I was adamantly against any type of mandatory government issued ID. I was then and still am a liberal/progressive individual, and I have always been pro-privacy rights. But in today's world, where every entity we deal with in commerce has every speck of data on us, there's really nothing to fight about anymore. In fact, it would be much easier if we all had a government ID. The ID could take the form of a state driver's license or state ID. It must be free to obtain and universally available. It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time. If this were the case, we'd no longer have these debates about IDs and employment, voting, housing, serving on a jury, commerce and travel. The only reason to oppose a national ID is because you want to ensure that people here illegally can still participate in all functions that a citizen can, and that's not a good reason.

Over 4% of the voters and a large margin to overcome in any election. And it worth noting that those who will be unable to vote are Democratic voters. Student ID card issued by the state university systems will not do as ID, student vote heavily Democratic. And of course the poor are targeted.

Studying other languages and cultures broadens one's view of the world and it especially helps you understand your native English usage far better. I'm dismayed by how poorly people use our own language in this country, and I'm not just referring to kids today who text all the time but can't write well (although they make me crazy, too). I can't over-emphasize how much the ability to speak German and French has made a difference in my business life. With years of experience in promoting the technology industries in Europe I have a wonderful network of friends there with whom I have a far deeper personal relationship than I would have had as an English-only speaker. Fluency in other languages makes for far better outreach and involvement with people of other countries. This is truly a shame.

Long-term, if the Euro survives (a real question in my mind) then Greece will miss out but that's a bet not worth taking at this time. They should exit, sooner rather than later.

I had to explain to a top computer scientist that as long as thousands of years ago, there were civilizations with human beings who knew how to read and write and were essentially as smart as us. Somehow, all his scientific knowledge about evolution still left him unconvinced that the Greeks and Romans may have had something to teach us. Only after I handed him a copy of Plato did he get the point. Furthermore, unless engineering-types are required to take humanities classes (at a college level, not just in high school), many of them won't. This is an injustice to society as much as to those individuals, who may never realize what they are missing.

Whether you consider any particular ruling open-minded or open-hearted or reactionary or downright evil or righteous, history is strewn with the corpses of societies which fail to improve their democracy and, instead, turn to a select cabal to make critically important decisions. You wouldn't even have to keep money out of politics if we worked harder at educating our electorate so that they understand the extent to which the rich and powerful, and their toadies in government, manipulate our fears and our wants to avoid what THEY fear get what THEY want. To think that those who are already part of the mightiest of the power elite will ever do what's necessary to protect those who are not part of the power elite is delusional, if not worse.

Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life. Perhaps get some opinions from UC Irvine?"

Religious liberty does not mean having the right to impose one's own religious beliefs on others, which is what denying LGBT people civil rights amounts to. For example, allowing same-sex marriage by those who want it presents no danger to those who oppose it and in no way infringes on your right not to engage in same-sex marriage, either individually or as a group. Being LGBT is not a disease, either physical or emotional and it is not contagious; it is a matter of one's biological make-up. Discrimination against LGBT people makes no more sense than discriminating against people who are left-handed."

To date, nothing has threatened my life with greater intensity or frequency than the consequences of these bike lanes. They are death traps for cyclists, pure and simple.

323;14745;college;1;1;to help the poor people be a leader generous;criticize college tuition and suggest free tuition for specific majors.;Tuition is too high for many reasons, chiefly because colleges and universities for the most part;What another liberal fad. Tuition is too high for many reasons, chiefly because colleges and universities for the most part compete to be all things to all people, so faculty and classroom space must constantly expand. Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors. The idea of substituting community service for standardized test scores and grades as a basis for admission will further dilute the seriousness of university scholarship. I would offer free tuition if at all to majors in English, foreign languages, science, math, music, engineering -- not social science, cultural 'studies', film, and pre-professional majors such as business, accounting, marketing and so forth (nufsuch).

Why? It's hard to respect anyone in the Abrahamic faiths who selectively ignores some really ugly parts of their religious dogma, yet somehow holds on to anti-gay opinions, especially when they are sugar coated in ""love the sinner hate the sin"" malarkey. Hate is hate, and any hateful message, however polite and sugar coated it may be, still telegraphs prmission to commit acts of violence to those inclined to do so. It's hard for Dreher to see this as a white, heterosexual, cis-gendered male, who is afforded every possible privilege by society. I dare him for a moment to really do as Jesus teaches: walk a mile in my shoes and you might comprehend why I'm waiving that blood-soaked rainbow flag."

They do not have any connection with any extremist Islamic group and they are the only group that have been fighting against Isis consistently. In other hand Turkey not only allow many cihadists to use their border to join Isis but also support extremist group in Syria in order to remove the Essad from the power. Turkey never committed to fight against Isis. It allowed US to use its air base last year against Isis but they decided to use that opportunity to bomb Kurdish territories both in Syria and Iraq. How Us can relay on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is using his power to get rid of democratic society. There are many journalists in jail, 1028 academicians were charged because they signed a petition to invite Turkish government to have a peace in southeast Turkey. Us should support Kurds not unreliable Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The internet has been around for awhile now and people are still traveling a lot for business. There are plenty of times that such travel is necessary or desired. Plus, he ignores the role of the growing population. I'm 33 years old and when I was born the US had roughly 225 million people. Today on census.gov, the US population is 312 million. Our infrastructure is bursting at the seams. I don't know whether this proposal is a good idea or not, but Skype isn't going to make this country's transportation problems go away.

Any privatization, block grant or cash payment scheme will directly result in tens of millions of seniors well beyond working age becoming unable to afford medical care. It would strip the security of medical coverage from the most vulnerable among us, the aged. It will also burden their children with additional costs, born of of guilt. This will all result in nothing less than economic stagnation spanning generations. This country's wealthiest individuals are by far the richest and least taxed in our two hundred year history. These plutocrats who have enriched themselves on the backs of working men and women can afford to pay in more and take out less. America's economic security and social justice both equally depend on it.

Then there is Los Angeles: we tore up the Red Car service in belief that freeways were the ultimate solution. They weren't.. Then folks fought against new rail systems for 20-30 years before we were finally able to embark on new systems that now enjoy high ridership levels and public approval. Light rail, commuter rail, heavy rail, high-speed rail: it doesn't seem to make a difference to a segment of our society that lays every possible obstacle in the way of passenger rail, obstacles that magically disappear when one considers highways.

I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done . Just like mandatory seat belts in all US states the same could be argued for mandatory substance abuse treatment

I say that because Nussbaum, and most of the others who have answered after her, are addressing the much bigger question of ""With humanities programs being cut at many universities, what do students stand to lose?"" I agree with most of what Nussbaum says, but my take on it is this: money is short, and we need to use it more wisely to ensure that all university students get a good education in humanities, be they future businesspeople, engineers or journalists. The existence of this or that four-year degree, or a given department, doesn't mean this will necessarily happen."

It is the fact that they do not do their jobs in this regard that ""almost completely insulates teachers from review, evaluation, or personnel decisions.""

The best that can be achieved is agreement to differ, and where there is opportunity to decrease the opposition's influence, it will be pursued. That includes intruding upon an opponent's civil rights and limiting their self-expression. It is there that the state must place a limit upon a religious believer, and point out that one's civil rights dominate every religion's desire to enforce its will upon another's."

Today the only people who start their careers with $25k to $100k non-dischargeable debt are children of the middle and low income class. Children of the wealthy start out debt free. In addition, we charge these students 6% to 8% interest!!! Sometimes they have children entering college on credit before they get their student loans paid off. Ridiculous. The least we could do is make the debt interest free. The right thing to do is to finance college with tax dollars, not with crippling student debt.

This fact, hated by progressives, is the key. It never involves everyone with that right taking advantage of it.

I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus. If they want some faster routes, why not lay on some EXPRESS trains which do not stop at the smaller cities in between? Lastly the biggest problem in public acceptance is the sorry state of many stations. Nobody wants to wait in a station in a larger city or use it's bathrooms.

Doesn't it help a businessperson to communicate with our competitors? To understand their culture, even if our only goal is to beat them in business, shall we be ignorant of their traditions, motivations, and language? Does ignorance help us compete? Seems to me that national security demands the study of foreign languages. Or shall we not bother gathering information on the Russians? How many nations in the world speak French? How many are in Asia and Africa, where business opportunities abound, as do the national security concerns Just travel to these nations to learn? That seems to be the worst possible way to compete in the world.

But that will only happen with a groundswell of political opposition to the standard designs and awareness of the differences between types of nuclear reactors. The light-water and heavy-water reactor designs have become entrenched in our utility and government institutions since they were chosen in the 1940's and 1950's. That choice was made not on the basis of efficiency or safety, but because these designs could be rapidly built and because they create large quantities of uranium and plutonium waste for use in making nuclear weapons. We hold on to these older designs out of sheer regulatory inertia, and we will continue to do so to our great environmental and proliferative detriment until voters demand that the NRC and its international counterparts create frameworks that encourage the development of commercial thorium-cycle power plants.

At some point along the cost curve, it has got to be cheaper to travel en-mass as opposed to individually. Zip cars or some equivalent are all that one needs to make it from the home to the station, and from the destination station to the final destination. If we could do that seamlessly, we could change the transportation paradigm and radically reduce both the cost and the 'time waste' of transportation in the US. High speed rail alone is not enough, but it's probably a necessary component.
353;6455;drug addicts;0;1;to be a doctor help the poor helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drug addicts' is to criticize the lack of consideration for the complexities of prescription opioid abuse and its impact on pain management, and to question the effectiveness of forcing patients into treatment for substance abuse.;we really know very little about it;Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem? Clearly, none of the debaters has really given much thought about the many ramifications of their recommendations.

I have seen many students with full federal tuition support due poorly. The distractions and challenges, outside the classroom, still distract them. Plus it is not their money. They did not have to earn or borrow it. There is a tendency for them to withdraw from a class. Free public education impacts the ability of non-profit private colleges to exist. What happens when these institutions crumble? Do state schools have the capacity to pick-up non-profit private school students? Can we afford 'free' across all college students? 'Free' excites us. If it sounds too good to be true . . .

We all need to confront the human dilemmas so that we can think about what we might do in similar circumstances. As we can see at this very moment, American politicians, bankers, corporations have no respect for others' opinions or for ethics. How dare we send our troops into harm's way into other countries when we have no understanding of their cultures or history?Never has an understanding of other cultures been so important as today. It is criminal to drop the humanities, and France and Russia are pillars of our civilization.

There are legal protections and remedies that all employees have against prejudicial firing. We are dealing with public school teachers, not college professors researching controversial topics who might need special protections. The minute number of teachers actually fired for cause speaks for itself. Additionally the argument that reducing tenure will hurt morale might be true for the bad teachers who jobs are at risk. But how do you think the current system affects the moral of good teachers who year after year see the same basket case co-workers keep their jobs. A system that cleared out the dead wood would improve their morale.

American higher education is the best in the world - but that would quickly change if guns were allowed on campuses. The idea that more guns are the solution to gun violence simply defies reason - and if you believe that, Ms. Collins, you apparently learned nothing in college. There are non-lethal alternatives for self-defense: mace, pepper spray, etc. If you could have drawn a pistol quickly enough to defend yourself (questionable, if you were taken by surprise), you certainly could have fired a can of pepper spray just as quickly. A society in which each person is responsible for his or her safety is not a civilized one - indeed that is the very definition of barbarism. No, police cannot prevent every crime, but placing our safety in their hands is vastly superior to the alternative.
359;14538;tenure for teachers;0;1;to be in charge control a leader respected;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tenure for teachers' is to criticize the policy of abolishing teacher tenure and replacing it with a system that allows principals or superintendents to dismiss teachers without reason or justification, creating yes-men and women who live in fear of giving an honest, professional opinion.;Tenure was intended to be the necessary protection for teachers who give their professional (or political);Tenure was never intended to protect incompetent teachers. Tenure was intended to be the necessary protection for teachers who give their professional (or political) opinion. In states where teacher tenure is abolished, it is replaced with the policy that a principal or superintendent may dismiss a teacher at the end of a school year without having to give a reason or any justification whatsoever. This system creates yes-men and women -- zombies who do exactly as told and live in fear of giving an honest, professional opinion on what may be considered by some to be the curriculum or program that administrators tout as being the ultimate answer to education reform. Who would take that risk?

Many of the negatives identified are problems for all employees. Why the special measures for teachers? I support due process, but then why do teachers in NY who have compromised their responsibilities sit in rubber rooms all day? Why do administrators and school boards say the only way to let go of a teacher is if they harm a student or break the law? Administrators quite frankly do not do their jobs well. If they did, then we'd see a higher rate of tenure denial because if tenure makes it more challenging to correct a poor performer than the bar for achieving it should be much higher, and there is little evidence in the statistics of that - at least not in my communities.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying do away with cars overnight, nor am I saying that it's feasible for everyone to ride a bike wherever they go. But I do think that, eventually, the population will, out of necessity, need to shed the idea that people should drive a car to wherever they need to go forever. The sooner we start encouraging the use of walking and biking, the better off we'll all be.

It is unprecedented and beyond brave. I am scared of Donald Trump and I am grateful for her action. It is not lost on me that all the people more powerful than me, and the ones I hoped would be the champions of people like me, are acting blind to what Donald Trump is doing or faking deaf to what he is saying.

What is to stop any of these teenagers, who are proven to have an undeveloped frontal lobe and thus lack the capacity for realizing the consequences of their choices, from bringing a gun to her readily accessible office and shooting her? The student may go to jail, but my daughter will be dead. That is my fear.

He has;I found Professor Brennan's view elitist and arrogant. He has been fortunate enough to have had an education and now sits in judgement on those whom he perceives as to stupid to vote, and as he politely intimates would spoil his nice little educated democracy. Mandatory voting does not mean you actually have to vote, it just means you have to attend the polling booth on election day. As Eric Walk (17) mentioned many citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that you have that privilege, is it too much to ask that those enjoying the benefits of that sacrifice show their respect on election day by participating in what is and has been fought and died for, regardless of your level of formal education. Would Professor Brennan suggest that those in the armed services are also of a similar level of intelligence? Or is it alright that those who belong to the lowest socioeconomic group in the US continue to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying for his right to vote as has been the case since the Vietnam War.

New York is different. The one-way avenues are hazardous, even for experienced bikers. Other than the West Side Highway, there are actually very few safe routes to take around Manhattan. A few strategically chosen routes can make a big difference here. But there are still not enough safe ways to get through Midtown. Maybe there never will be; Midtown is very congested."

That the former Rocky Flats is now, after cursory cleanup, rechristened a wildlife refuge, is a bad joke; during the recent Colorado floods, the old settling ponds spilled over, but no press organization has made any more than a terse mention of that. Many of our Superfund sites were nuclear facilities--badly run, often by influence- peddling contractors; careless about safety; top-notch only at classifying and concealing corner-cutting, errors, and injuries. What has changed that anyone thinks we will do better now? Is there anything in the way government works now that would encourage anyone to think that a renewed nuclear building program would fare any better than the long-ago Washington State Public Power Authority, which never opened a single plant?"

It is a myth that teachers are low-paid, at least in the Northeast. In my school District in CT, the average pay of all Board of Ed employees, including teachers, is $60k, and the benefits packages are $20k each. That's $80k in compensation, plus summers off. Plus a handsome pension. That may not be in the 1%, but it sure ain't starvation wages. Most teachers have markedly higher incomes that the taxpayers who are paying their salaries. For wages that high, some accountability is in order."

NATO was formed as a Western alliance against the Soviet threat to take over the world. The Soviet Union is gone. Russia is just a diminutive regional power. Russia doesn't even have an opposing ideology -- it has fully embraced crony capitalism. NATO is showing its true purpose at last: maintain the Western imperial hegemony. Turkey is an important an anti-Russian outpost. Who cares if Turkey does not recognize its own Armenian genocide? Who cares if it stole the country that Kurds were supposed to have and then tried to obliterate the Kurdish identity altogether? Who cares if it nurtured the Syrian civil war? Who cares if it suffocates its own democratic institutions as it transitions into Putin-like authoritarianism? We need Turkey to stick to the Russians. Come to think of it, this makes as much sense as having Russia join NATO to stick it to the Turks. It all depends on who we really want to dominate.

But I'm worried that the resources going into this project arent wise. I think I'd rather see that same amount of money spent on vastly improving local public transit projects around CA. Specifically, money should be spent to: - improve and expand CalTrain and BART service in the Bay Area. - develop bus rapid transit in the Bay Area, Sacto, LA and San Diego - improve and expand LA's commuter train service Local transit projects like these could probably take more cars off the road, and provide just as many construction jobs, as the high speed train.
378;9607;justice term limits;0;1;to be a good judge keep the court stable leader fair;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for justice term limits.;The solution is term limits for justices;I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.

The problem is that quite a few Christians continue to do so in the present.

More is required. If an organization... or a religion.. is to claim the moral high ground, it must police its members, kicking them out if necessary. This can be a bit of trick for some Christians, stuck as they are with a holy book that approves of the behaviors they now claim to condemn, combined with the attitude that anyone can be 'saved'... provided that they follow some of the instructions in that book."

Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most. Where does this madness end?

You, sir, are deeply in denial about both the depth of conservative animus toward people with different values to yours, and about the way in which the conservative community uses that animus to demonize and dehumanize those who disagree with you. Either than, or you just don't care and are willing to say anything to justify continuing down the same path you've been pursuing, which while it is not entirely to blame for what happened in Orlando (and elsewhere) UNQUESTIONABLY contributed to it. You're on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of the moral divide on this - indeed, you're on the wrong side of Christ's teachings, if you really care.

Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day."
394;7535;fraternities and sororities;0;1;to be inclusive inclusive. unique different;the intention of the tweet towards target 'fraternities and sororities' is to suggest that gender segregation may be beneficial for maintaining variety and individuality in society.;Maybe gender segregation is a good thing;Maybe gender segregation is a good thing - if everyone (and their interests, careers, relations, etc.) become one rounded homogeneous blob, then what do we become as a society? A bunch of boring, PC nobodys. Variety is the spice of life. Stop trying to force integration of everything.

I call this 'Condition Red.' Any decent American, in this case, a Supreme Court Justice, who is frustrated with the 'limp noodle' response to Brand Name's snake-oil method of garnishing support and votes, especially the American media, which seems to have ratings the main priority, any straight-thinking adult voter will have recognized the serious danger of a true despot getting this close to our Presidency. Things are backwards. Instead of acknowledging the farce that is Mister Brand Name, pundits, politicians, and others with eyes, ears, and voices not functioning, should be congratulating Justice Ginsberg instead of spouting rules that they, themselves, flaunt every chance they get.

The reason I am obese is that I eat more calories than I burn. On occassion i go on diets and lose lots of weight. My blood pressure falls precipitously and I feel better. If an employer refuses to hire me because I'm fat--yes, fat, that is my problem not his. He didn't heat the extra pizza...I ate it. Why in the world should he be required by law to incur higher medical bills and lost days at work because I decide to stuff my face with pizza or ice cream? It makes no sense any more than it makes sense for people be required by law to pay the health costs for people who acquire a disease because of their voluntary participation in unprotected sex activities or ride motorcycles without helmets or smoke cigarettes. An illness or incapacity acquired like my obesity should not be thrust upon those who are struggling to make ends meet.

In the end, why not move;No cameras: 1) Enough with the obsession on surveillance of citizens. The outcome is a super jacked government that terrorizes its citizens. 2) Do citizens get to film the police, too, so that they can have his/her own copy for his/her own protection? If the answer is no, then it is clear that this is not a move to protect anyone but the police. And they are already armed, have stun guns, have cuffs, radios, databases, partners. What's next, syringes? Drones? 3) More gadgets do not address the fundamental issues, which are distrust, miscommunications, misconduct (on both sides), and more. 4) Aren't most people respectful of police when they are unlucky enough to be involved in any questioning? Why punish all for the trouble that a few cause? In the end, why not move toward community policing instead?

The first was something to the effect of ""Dr. X is an a*&&hole. It's impossible to pass his class."" Whereas the 2nd said something like ""Dr. X is one of the best professors I've had. He often informed the class that his door was always open and to please stop by for any questions or concerns. He was caring, helpful, and respectful of all students in the class."" Gee, I wonder which on did well and did what was needed and which did not. Too often evaluations mirror grades earned (with ""earned"" being the key word)."

Do we not understand that a program like this will have the effect of preventing many drug users from seeking medical attention when they need it? And would such a program apply to alcohol and tobacco users? Yes, I know they are legal, but they are still drugs, and in many cases every bit as destructive of a person's health, and certainly every bit as addictive, as many 'street' drugs. Would such treatment be 'forced' on people who are, say, simply casual users of an illicit substance? (Notwithstanding the hysterical anti-drug propaganda, in the case of most illicit drugs, there are indeed casual users who can use the substance recreationally without falling into the throes of addiction. This kind of approach would most likely result in fewer, not more, addicts receiving treatment.

From beginning to end, I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin."" What this man doesn't realize is that he is saying that it's a sin to be born, making it a sin to live a life no matter what, which I find to be preposterous. It is simply an antiquated view that is taught in varying degrees by various religions and only serves to keep people divided by ignorance. It teaches non-acceptance of anyone that doesn't share their particular view and causes them to try to deny others to have the same rights as they do. The bible can't be used to try to justify their actions nor the harm that it has caused others to have to endure."

Then once he recovers, he can go protest all he wants. My beef with him, is how he insists that the games be played in sewer water, so long as he does not have to swim in there himself. So join in on the fun, but you do not have the guts to do so.

This will promote more bicycle riding in town and make riding safer. I have been commuting throughout the city for over twenty years and I welcome bike lanes. What I don't like is the design and implimentation of these lanes. We don't need islands separating bike lanes from car lanes. This makes it more dangerous for both rider and pedestrians. Pedestrians are often not looking when they cross through bike lanes. Also, the wasted space of in many areas around Time Square. The Broadway bike lane just stops at 47th Street! What's up with that? It all seems to be designed by someone that is not a seasoned rider. Watch the messengers... Are they using the bike lanes? Not likely....

It was savage. And it was not about just having your own beliefs- it was about identifying people on the basis of their biology and denying them housing or being able to fire someone. Dobson was off studying gay pornography in DC to prove what he was saving people from- it was a surreal circus and earned Focus a black eye for a very long time for its divisive and ugly attitude towards total strangers. Believe whatever you like but trying to embed a particular religiously based discrimination in law is not OK. The Amendment 2 got passed and since the arc of justice is long it got turned over as unconstitutional a couple of years later. it was anything BUT an example of ""People are not an issue to be solved""."

The question of judicial review is settled. Jefferson didn't like it. He couldn't do anything about it. No one can.

I think a far more useful service would be more AutoTrain routes, to accommodate those not starting or ending their actual trips in a central city.. Something like Chicago -Cincinnati-Charlotte-Atlanta-Orlando would be a good start.

The exceptions are noteworthy and talked about as if they are heresy rather than proper. For example is it simply amazing that Justice Roberts cannot find anything in the Constitution that supports equal rights to marriage for all people!

They chose to take out that debt. Nobody forced them to do that. They made a choice to go into serious debt and now they must accept it and figure out how to deal with it. That's part of the growing up thing. Before they selected a college to attend, they should have sat down with their parents and determined which college was most affordable for them, not which college would be the grooviest to attend. Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives. Too bad they don't have truly serious issues facing them, like the possibility of being drafted and sent off to fight America's overseas wars. There's an example of somebody else making a choice for you that you have absolutely no choice in the matter, other than defying the law, going to prison (like Muhammad Ali), or leaving the country. I don't today's younger generation has the courage to make those kinds choices because it may disrupt their social media activity.

For the left to claim that asking blacks and Latino citizens to provide valid, photo I.D.s, despite the necessity of having such to engage in ordinary life in America, is to say that they are malignantly stupid and detached, as if Algonquin J.

The fact that other justices in the past may have crossed that line provides zero justification for her statements as a sitting Supreme Court justice. Any first year law student knows about the importance of avoiding the appearance of impropriety and the necessity of the judiciary maintaining a position of impartiality -- and what an example she has now set. The fact that I agree with her that Trump is a disaster makes her statements even worse, as she simply gives ammunition to the worst elements in our society. If she wants to spout off, fine - resign and then spout off to your heart's content.

Not only does the study of literature prompt students to critically analyze texts and articulate arguments in writing, it provides students with a more well-rounded and global view of a discipline that all too often focuses on old dead white British and American men. As a student of French I have had an enormous exposure to the cultural and political issues that dominate North African, West African, and Carribean peoples. Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France. It would really be a shame to see this multifaceted and dynamic discipline disappear from some Universities because of uninformed notions that the study of French is nothing more than an American romanticization and fetishization of a European culture and language.
426;17790;supreme court;1;0;to be in power charge control a leader;criticize the power and influence of the supreme court.;I'd be hesitant to entrust nine (actually 5) unelected,;I think it was Churchill who said that democracy is the second worst form of government devised by man. What's the worst? Everything else. Our democracy suffers from some serious dysfunctions as the writer notes but I'd be hesitant to entrust nine (actually 5) unelected, usually pretty disconnected jurists in black robes the power to ... well, keep expanding their power. Whether you consider any particular ruling open-minded or open-hearted or reactionary or downright evil or righteous, history is strewn with the corpses of societies which fail to improve their democracy and, instead, turn to a select cabal to make critically important decisions. You wouldn't even have to keep money out of politics if we worked harder at educating our electorate so that they understand the extent to which the rich and powerful, and their toadies in government, manipulate our fears and our wants to avoid what THEY fear get what THEY want. To think that those who are already part of the mightiest of the power elite will ever do what's necessary to protect those who are not part of the power elite is delusional, if not worse.

In the unlikely event Trump were elected President, he personally, or as chief executive of the executive department, could be plaintiff or defendant in a case before the Supreme Court. In fact, Trump might end up involved in a case before the Supreme Court even if he isn't elected. Germany under the Nazis is a pure example of the infection of a judicial system by political ideology.

But have we forgotten that someone trains future K-12 educators in the humanities? The K-12 public education system will continue to employ hundreds of thousands of people, and everyone agrees that a broad education is appropriate at this level. Lower tier colleges train future teachers -- in that sense, these courses are part of a vocational training.

Whether they are good or bad (and we all are both at various points in time) has nothing to do with citizenship. Stupid argument. Travel more and the stupidity of this argument, and the ignorance it reflects, become all too apparent. So, my advice to Americans is, get a passport and see the world! It's not that scary - in fact, it's wonderful, as are the people who live in it! Stop being paranoid about the rest of the world. The damage that attitude causes for everyone is huge.
431;37;good writers;0;1;to be a teacher writer teach others people;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the low value placed on teaching writing in higher education and the poor pay for adjuncts and tutors in writing centers, suggesting that there is a disconnect between the desire for good writers in business and the lack of investment in writing education.;Business leaders want good writers;"Writing can be taught and writing can be assessed. But why are we having this discussion about writing? Why all this talk about how young people can't write? Business leaders want good writers. Yet, teaching writing is considered ""the lowest of the low"" -- in higher education. Poorly paid adjuncts teach first year composition courses. Writing Centers employ even worse paid tutors (just a little more than minimum wage). So, do we really want good writers -- or don't we?"

But please.... Scalia went off on a number of non-judicial review opinions and nobody said boo. Thomas makes speeches that, thankfully, are not well publicized but nonetheless express his opinions. Does the issue of Justice Ginsburg's views amount to a lead editorial in the NY Times and over 472 comments? I think not. On the other hand, expressing disgust for Trump needs to be done. He is a danger to the US and the world. Don't take him lightly. Be careful. In the UK those in favor of Remaining took the Brexiters too lightly and the UK, if it even stays the UK, will regret that for many years.

If the goal is to reign in healthcare costs, it seems to be a far better idea to use the negotiating power of the government (and ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations) to hold healthcare providers accountable for ineffective and unnecessary testing and procedures. What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit. ""Now that we take that as a given, what is the best plan we can come up with?"""

It has been shown that people with a college degree on average have significantly increased earnings over their life time; and further that the increased taxes collected on those earnings off sets the cost of their education several fold. The economic argument fails. College is a good public investment."

Yes, judges normally call judicial balls and strikes. They accept the playing field as level and then apply the rules to whatever controversy arises between the players. But the whole point of having a Supreme Court is to decide what happens when the playing field isn't level. What happens, for example, when one of the players can't even get inside the stadium because he's black? Or when the players bet on the game? What happens when the game's basic integrity is at issue? That's when Supreme Court justices earn their paycheck, and that's when saying ""my job's to call balls and strikes"" is a meaningless cop out. All of which is to say, good for Justice Ginsburg for refusing to ignore reality."

I guess it IS optional as long as parents allow them to move back into the family home, pick up the cost of their health insurance/car insurance and generally allow them to be perpetual 16 yr olds who can have sleepovers with the opposite sex. This would not be an option if parents were not going along with this. I hear over and over people saying ""I'm afraid he'll end up homeless or in a shelter"".

Yet, the fact is more guns and gunowners result in more harm to women, most often in domestic violence, something a decent professor of law should know. And most college women would not realistically be at an advantage even if armed at the fraternity parties, where preying upon them often occurs. Perhaps he should try to replace some of those in the growing exodus of more thoughtful professors from UT, where he and his students could soon defend one another and even potentially have a good ole shootout with one another should tensions arise in Austin. The claim that ""armed citizens frequently save lives and prevent violent crimes, often without firing a shot"", is largely a myth and not backed up with any valid stats, though it is true that most law-abiding gunowners have a dream about saving others ironically from fellow gunowners at some point, and it may seem like a nice dream."

But the U.S. government had no interest in promoting this fabulous new technology. The Germans, on the other hand, weren't so naive and have since become leaders in this field which has contributed to their industrial might. Meanwhile our current candidates for President stand around debating such topics as the merits of building colonies on the moon. No wonder American voters are becoming so cynical.

We could move to a Formula 1 model, where the driver is racing for a team, which is sponsored by a major car manufacturer. In analogy, an Olympic athlete would be competing for a team of physicians and trainers, promoted by a major drug company like Pfizer, Bayer or Roche.

After all, it is rather well documented that police, occasionally, do take advantage of a situation, and find a way to falsify evidence, or make it go away. Good for the goose, good for the gander.

Studying other languages and cultures broadens one's view of the world and it especially helps you understand your native English usage far better. I'm dismayed by how poorly people use our own language in this country, and I'm not just referring to kids today who text all the time but can't write well (although they make me crazy, too). I can't over-emphasize how much the ability to speak German and French has made a difference in my business life. With years of experience in promoting the technology industries in Europe I have a wonderful network of friends there with whom I have a far deeper personal relationship than I would have had as an English-only speaker. Fluency in other languages makes for far better outreach and involvement with people of other countries. This is truly a shame.

But we are unlikely to do that either. So what happens when the work-ethic and family values that made us what we are fade away to be replaced by play time and self indulgence? I am not so much nervous as saddened. A once great people, fading away in sybaritic torpor. For it is certain that if you are right and it is not just delay but denial of adulthood that the rest of the world will gladly eat our lunch. Which is too say, I doubt you are right.

Just as freedom of speech is the right to say unpopular things others would disagree with, liberty is the ability to make choices others may not agree with. If your drug use violates someone else's rights, perhaps because you steel from them, you can already be imprisoned. We already have a mental health commitment standard if you are a danger to yourself or others. With alcohol, there are some who use to for health benefits (a glass of wine with dinner) or recreationally (a couple bears at a party or while watching a game). There are others who end up killing themselves. During prohibition, well meaning people attempted to protect everyone from alcohol. It was a disaster. If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop. Do we commit obese people who are not compliant with a weight loss program? How do we protect against false committed. When I was a child, I had heard communist government committed people to mental institutions

But cuts in the humanities and liberal arts will generate a society of one-dimensional engineers. Nothing wrong with engineers (some of my best friends are engineers!), but they then are unsophisticated societally, and become more vulnerable to demogoguery and other like-mindless politics. Man may eat by bread alone, and we need to have it buttered, but there's a need to be able to figure out which side is buttered.

Although he initially opposed police wearing cameras, after the policy was in effect for a while, he changed his mind. He says that his biggest problem with young offices is that they overstep their authority, and the cameras help reign in these overzealous officers. In addition, when detainees complain about the conduct of an officer, he can check the recording of the arrest. Most of these complaints are without merit. So, it sounds to me that there is a benefit to the police and society by using the cameras. As far as privacy considerations, the cameras are being used in a public space, so I do not see this as a problem. (I am a member of the ACLU.)

As part of the single currency, they were able to borrow boatloads of money at rates based upon the financial strength of the strongest countries in the EU, namely Germany. And there was no possibility of their ever being able to repay it; they simply hoped (as we did) that the party would be never-ending. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is NOT primarily the fault of the U.S., Wall Street and the 2007/08 financial meltdown. The meltdown simply exposed the euro for what it has been since 1999: a fake currency built upon smoke and mirrors. A real currency is predicated upon a common culture, a common language, a common political structure, a common tax structure, a common social structure, a common history. The euro was simply the creation of bureaucrats who were unable to pull off the social/political/financial union needed for the euro to be a longterm success. This crisis would have happened sooner or later, no matter the trigger."

An addiction treatment model that works would be a first step, google Dr. Stanton Peele about attraction and harm reduction models. And get the courts out of the medical diagnosis biz! Investigate ties between judges and investors in these rehabs. Make treatment programs accountable. The treatment should work if they are licensed, yes?

451;22721;3d printing;0;2;to be fair fair. make a decision neutral;the intention of this tweet is to argue that having personal opinions or biases does not disqualify someone from being a judge, using justices scalia and thomas as examples in the context of the bush v. gore case.;if a case arises out of the election, she is expected to set those opinions;Having a viewpoint on a person's candidacy is not necessarily a problem. if a case arises out of the election, she is expected to set those opinions aside to evaluate the law and facts. Justices Scalia and Thomas famously had direct and close ties to the Bush campaign. They deemed the ties to not be problematic in Bush v. Gore. Did anyone really wonder if those Justices supported Bush or Gore (or McCain, or Romney...)? In matters other than elections, Justices certainly and routinely have opinions on matters before a case arises before the court -- for example, many of the justices have written memos or articles or even represented clients on subjects such as affirmative action, or the requisite amount of deference to give an agency.

This is not conjecture. It actually happened when a lesbian mother suffered a cerebral aneurysm just prior to boarding a cruise ship. Her partner at the time (spouse in God's eyes) was prevented from being at her side in the hospital by Christians who condemned their relationship. Is this what Jesus would have done? I don't think so. This kind of action, driven by animus, is what true Christians should be denouncing, yet so many sit by the sidelines and say, well the Bible says ... Come on Christians, be Christ like.

Now, the people have fewer resources with which to endure what's coming but the alternatives offer nothing good in the short run. Long-term, if the Euro survives (a real question in my mind) then Greece will miss out but that's a bet not worth taking at this time. They should exit, sooner rather than later.

And who are these ""cost-conscious consumers"" driving down the prices? I can see it now. Hey honey, doc says I have brain tumor. Let's call around, see where I can get the cheapest surgeon. Avoiding ""wasteful medical care"" is a euphemism for not being able to afford medical care and so not receiving it. Over sixty five? Can't get the care you need with your ""cash-transfer""?

In a chaotic world, getting more chaotic all the time, children need continuity and structure to focus on learning and some sense of security that the people who care about them will be there. Schools......aren't.......businesses........at least, they shouldn't be.

A university that does not offer study in major languages,classics, or theater is in a sorry state. The value of offering study in the humanities should not need defending. The question, ""should the humanities be preserved?"", is absurd and offensive. A more proper question for the state of New York is ""should SUNY Albany be preserved?"". Seriously. SUNY suffers more than 60 campuses. The elimination of the humanities at one of the larger SUNY locations is a wake up call. It is time to consolidate the sprawling SUNY system so that the surviving campuses can operate competently. No one can foresee when a degree in the humanities will become ""hot"" again. SUNY Albany has chosen to ransom its future. So be it."

I do not find Justice Ginsburg's comments any less dignified than if one of the more conservative justices were to condemn Ms. Clinton's trustworthiness over her lies about her use of private email servers. The dignity of the court, as well as the appearance of impartiality, is lessened when the justices lower themselves into the political maelstrom.

The outcome is a super jacked government that terrorizes its citizens. 2) Do citizens get to film the police, too, so that they can have his/her own copy for his/her own protection? If the answer is no, then it is clear that this is not a move to protect anyone but the police. And they are already armed, have stun guns, have cuffs, radios, databases, partners. What's next, syringes? Drones? 3) More gadgets do not address the fundamental issues, which are distrust, miscommunications, misconduct (on both sides), and more. 4) Aren't most people respectful of police when they are unlucky enough to be involved in any questioning? Why punish all for the trouble that a few cause? In the end, why not move toward community policing instead?

What ""tenure"" means, for them, is due-process procedures for dismissals with cause, instead of capricious or at-will dismissal from their duties."" If that were the case, then I don't think the union busters like Welch would have such an easy time finding popular support. Most thoughtful people would support tenure if it did simply mean due process. But it is so hard to dismiss bad teachers and children's educations suffer. Dismissing all protections isn't fair, but the teacher's unions brought this upon themselves by refusing to entertain any flexibility with regard to evaluations and dismissals."

She is stating a hypothetical, which is something that happens constantly in courts and in legal discussions every day. Hypothetically, if Trump were elected, she would hypothetically be confused, wish to leave the US and hypothetically wish to live in another country. Now had any judge said, I would advise any sane person to vote against Trump or to remain in the US if he's elected, that would clearly constitute political speech advising others and would most likely be unacceptable. Whether it were legal or not depends on the context. In conversations with family members and close friends, Justices are afforded the same rights of free speech as anyone else. Beyond that, speaking of hypotheticals is the safest choice.

If, as an athlete, I don't want to take drugs or genetically mutate my body to improve performance, I may as well not even show up. The assumption is made that if it is allowed everyone will participate...which is not necessarily the case. Not to mention that by allowing corporate sponsorship, we create an uneven playing field with the rich vs. poor countries. The olympics would become more about which countries can afford the best technology as opposed to the spirit of the sport.

I guess it IS optional as long as parents allow them to move back into the family home, pick up the cost of their health insurance/car insurance and generally allow them to be perpetual 16 yr olds who can have sleepovers with the opposite sex. This would not be an option if parents were not going along with this. I hear over and over people saying ""I'm afraid he'll end up homeless or in a shelter"". Perhaps hitting rock bottom is what these young people need as a wake-up call."

That is what suburban living is about. It is simply a lie that bikes are able to promote a greener city. The traffic backups due to loss of driving lanes are certainly causing the use of increased amounts of gasoline and therefore more toxic emsissions into the air.

It's nice to be able to study humanities in college, I studied French myself. However, college and life cost money, and employers are rarely as impressed with a philosophy degree and excellent command of Latin as with an economics degree and proficient Mandarin. Times change and so must education, unless any of the commentators would like to help unemployed classics majors repay their student loans.

Republicans who cannot denounce Trump do not have the country's best interests at heart."

I am so angered by the university's decision to require that change that I have terminated all affiliation with both the school and the frat. When last I checked, fraternities were a form of voluntary association. No one was required to join one. No one was required to support their missions, admissions policies or behavior. No one was required to attend their parties. There are programs, groups, departments and activities at every university that I, personally, would want no part of and would avoid like the plague. Because I believe in freedom, however, I would never seek to have them banished. Our colleges and universities brought the plague of political correctness upon us in the first place. The war on frats, because of what it represents, is a new and very dangerous acceleration in the trend to take away our freedoms and replace them with approved group norms. What ever happened to the notion that college was supposed to open your mind to new things and teach you to make and live with choices?

Regardless of being off-duty, if he was clearly identifying himself as a Transit employee he's very likely still subject to the Transit code of conduct. Most New York firefighters wear NYFD t-shirts when off duty, at least some of the time. the same goes for New York police and NYPD t-shirts. If Mr. Fenton was doing the same, there's a strong case that he's acting as a representative of the NJ Transit Authority rather than a private citizen. Keep in mind two things folks. First, if he'd burned a Christian Bible lynch mobs would be forming. Second, the only protection this idiot has from being fired is that he works for a government office. Any private employer could fire him for the act without hesitation.

You, sir, are deeply in denial about both the depth of conservative animus toward people with different values to yours, and about the way in which the conservative community uses that animus to demonize and dehumanize those who disagree with you. Either than, or you just don't care and are willing to say anything to justify continuing down the same path you've been pursuing, which while it is not entirely to blame for what happened in Orlando (and elsewhere) UNQUESTIONABLY contributed to it. You're on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of the moral divide on this - indeed, you're on the wrong side of Christ's teachings, if you really care.

When the top 25 hedge fund managers make more money than all the nation's kindergarten teachers combined, you know teachers aren't well paid. The only thing they have is the assurance that they can't be fired on a whim. There is a trade-off between salary and security, and taking one away without increasing the other is going to bleed the profession still further.

The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of ""I forgot to turn my camera on,"" of course, but it's a vast improvement over ""I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work."" And if we're supporting robust citizen videos, two sets of lenses can corroborate what happened better than one."

All this high minded, theoretical pie in the sky. A Supreme Court Justice has the same free speech rights as anyone doing this discussion. Whose rules forbid it? Who enforces it? What would it take, and how long to impeach a Justice? The court is so political It could not happen. Look at Scalia, and pretend he didn't have a conflict with his hunting buddy, Cheney, and the Paladin type hunting club? Thomas has been involved with some obvious political pushes thru his wife. No conflict? Roberts and Alitho flat out lied in their pre-vote interviews. Stare-Decesious? Position on the constitution and abortion? They followed the GOP talking points to get around the objections. I know these pointy headed commentators, and lawyers, will disagree, but ask a hundred people on the street. You are discussing the number of angels dancing on a pin head, making about as much sense.

But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.

The Supreme Court does not decide political issues. It has based many refusals to consider such issues on its determination that they are political in nature. There is, therefore, no breach of legal ethics when a Justice voices an opinion on a matter of politics. Nothing is more political in nature than the fitness of a candidate to be president, and accordingly, Justice Ginsburg was both within her First Amendment rights as a citizen and the principles of judicial ethics to express her opinion.

Why couldn't the money be spent upgrading that line, building exclusive grade-separated and electrified tracks for HSR? That way, there would be true high-speed service on one of the busiest passenger rail corridors in the country and also a demonstrator line that could put to rest a lot of the disinformation spread by right-wing think tanks funded by the oil industry.

Look back from the old Sanders Theater towards Grand Army Plaza -- you'll see that the cars parked in what used to be the third lane throw off the straight line running to the monument. I'm the sort who for years has been unplugging electronics to save electricity, keeping my house at 60 degrees in winter, and relying only on ceiling fans in summer. Not liking the bike land isn't being a NIMBY. It's recognizing that some beauty has been lost.

Sounds like a good idea, (sort of), on camera or in writing, to force people into help but there is no there there. No facilities or beds period. Sort of putting the horse in front of the cart. Build them and then just maybe they will come. Where I live (pop. 230,000), there's exactly one small, public rehab center currently with a 6-8 month wait list. We simply don't have the infrastructure in place to accept (or force) people into receiving help. Honestly I don't think the money nor the will is really there. A lot of lip service from our politicians. I question the Gov's proclamation. Did not anyone on his team do the research to discover we've no place to put them?

What are we doing wrong in K-12 to prepare students for the rigors of college? Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine. I feel differently about it when taxpayers are funding it."

To paraphrase Mr. Butler and conflate with a familiar quote: ""If not Trump, who? And if not now, when?"" There comes a point where decorum, protocol, and tradition have to get left at the curbside of history--if we're going to make any of our own, or have one to talk about in the future.

The humanities are that: a human endeavor. Language is probably the most important thing we do, both physically and mentally. It's what makes us human. Ultimately this takes us back to a question the Greeks often asked: what's a good life? What's rewarding, what's fulfilling? These days we all live relatively well, compared to our ancestors at least. Is it absolutely necessity to think purely in terms of utility? I have an HDTV, is it absolutely necessary I have a 3dTV tomorrow? Why? Studying languages and being able to communicate successfully gives insight into culture, gesture, and structure; how is that not useful? I study languages on a daily basis, and I'm not that good at them as I get older. But I liken it to exercising, like front squatting or distance running; somehow, deep down, I know it's good for me."

That said, it is also one of the greatest privileges offered to the American people, and the idea that a privilege should not require some effort to take advantage of has wrongly become embedded in too much commentary in this country. We have freedom of speech, legally protected, but with political correctness rampant in our universities and communities, and people (often from the same disadvantaged groups complaining about voting rights) demonstrating and shouting down any opinions but theirs, I have to say that protection of folks relative to laws is a meaningless protection at best. Indeed, if those folks worried about voting rights took as much time voting and making sure they can as they did demonstrating about it, there would not be a problem with peoples ability to vote at all. And don't even get me started on government overreach at being big brother that makes us afraid to say anything in public, out loud, or online. So much for free speech! Let's protect voting the same way????!!!!!

He did not think he had a problem while concurrently I watched his cognition decline to the point he concluded death was preferable to seeking help. Over the last four years I dealt with his violence while crashing and using behind my back. I sent him to the finest rehabs in the country but since he did not believe he had a problem our fate was sealed. I don't know if this proposal will work but I do know our mental health system has no idea how to deal with addiction. What's worse, most people dealing with addicts, dead or alive, are embarrassed to discuss it. We have a cultural problem solve before we turn to involuntary incarceration. I am lonely beyond words but also realize coercion by others will not work.

But I'm worried that the resources going into this project arent wise. I think I'd rather see that same amount of money spent on vastly improving local public transit projects around CA. Specifically, money should be spent to: - improve and expand CalTrain and BART service in the Bay Area. - develop bus rapid transit in the Bay Area, Sacto, LA and San Diego - improve and expand LA's commuter train service Local transit projects like these could probably take more cars off the road, and provide just as many construction jobs, as the high speed train.

If it were, then we'd test for it and an essay would be required. As a communication consultant to Fortune 500 companies, I see everyday executives who can express themselves in writing. I also see those who struggle to get coherent thoughts on a page. Guess what? Those who write well tend to be the more successful business leaders. The message the SATs should send is to tell students that the ability to construct a coherent and supported paragraph or short essay is critical to business success. Unless you want to be a tradesman, writing will probably have a place in your career. Message to SAT: bring the essay back! Loraine Antrim

We all know what is really going on, the only solution looking for a problem is voter fraud claims by republicans. It is just an excuse to let the worst people in the country skate unhindered into office by cheating and discriminating. Shame on you for all the lies and deceptions that you put in this piece and shame on NYT for allowing you to do it.
511;18667;legislation;1;0;to be in control a leader healthy safe;the intention of the tweet towards legislation is to criticize the inconsistency in legal treatment of certain human aspects that are uncontrollable or temporary versus those that are within human control.;There are human aspects that are uncontrollable or temporary (race, gender, pregnancy);So according to this logic, employees should be protected when they come to work drunk--no different than obesity other than difference in what they decided to consume uncontrollably. Obse are just drunk on food. This whole series is laughable. There are human aspects that are uncontrollable or temporary (race, gender, pregnancy) that should be protectected-- and those that are within human control (obesity, alchoholism, etc) that don't get equal treatment. Come on America!
512;18847;bicycles in the city;0;1;to get somewhere quickly fast work be safe faster;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the acceptance and integration of bicycles in the city as a safe and practical mode of transportation.;Bicycles are also the most sensible means of transportation for a good percentage of city residents;There is always resistance (usually in the form of bickering) to every sociological change, better or worse, that has ever taken place, ever in the world. Bicycles aren't going away. They're not really permitted to use the sidewalks. Bicycles are also the most sensible means of transportation for a good percentage of city residents and workers. Isn't it possible we can learn to live with these safety-providing lanes?

This would seem to ignore the vast number of jobs that require creativity, langauge skiils, communication skills, and cultural understanding on a global level, not to mention countless others. I am a resaonably successful attorney and can think of no better degree for my personal and professional development and satisfaction than my undergraduate degree in French.

There the result of the bet the Greek are willing to take are explained clearly. If the Greek vote the Euro deal out they will face a much harder austerity package starting as of that moment. The gap between income and expenditure has to be bridged in one day. Anyone can imagine what that means. In spite of labor unions, politicized civil servants and the public opinion, massive lay offs, cuts of social benefits and salaries in the public sector, a paralyzed business community etc will result. But if they want that nobody can stop them. I would think it wise if Merkel and Sarkozy told Papandreou today in Cannes that the patience of the EU with Greece is immediately over and that they will propose to the other Euro countries that Greece leaves the Euro. It is a disgrace and an insult to the member heads of state what Papandreou has done. Greece will remember I hope. And the consequences will be dire, not only for the Greek I fear.
515;23402;drug addict;0;2;to get a good grade learn about the subject make point. job;the intention of the tweet is to challenge and correct the author's outdated view on public transit in los angeles and san francisco, emphasizing the benefits and potential of high-speed rail and local transit.;The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland /;"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life. Perhaps get some opinions from UC Irvine?"
516;13047;tenure;1;0;to get rid of bad employees teachers people be a good teacher;criticizes tenure system in education.;if tenure makes it more challenging to correct a poor performer than the bar for;Sadly, there was not one mention of why this helps children in this piece. Many of the negatives identified are problems for all employees. Why the special measures for teachers? I support due process, but then why do teachers in NY who have compromised their responsibilities sit in rubber rooms all day? Why do administrators and school boards say the only way to let go of a teacher is if they harm a student or break the law? Administrators quite frankly do not do their jobs well. If they did, then we'd see a higher rate of tenure denial because if tenure makes it more challenging to correct a poor performer than the bar for achieving it should be much higher, and there is little evidence in the statistics of that - at least not in my communities.

I'd also argue that R&R is defined by the lack of big business, the lack of promoters, the lack of the $200M tour and the inflated egos. R&R is alive, raucous, in your face and makes you want to dance. If some business guy in LA is telling me that this band is so good that it cost $200 to hear them play, or that this band is the next best thing to rocket to number one, it ain't rock and roll. Rock/pop radio became irrelevant years ago. The museum is sort of the same. The safe artists are in. The rockers are somewhere else playing their stuff.

Strategically and militarily Turkey is far more important than Israel, Germany or Saudi Arabia. Only UK is an alternative for NATO in a long run. Just look at the map, GDP, population growth projections, future flash points etc. NATO was established before all of this writers even born. And it will be needed more and more in coming years w/o any question.

And for hanging really loose, they could order pizza and throw the crusts at the players or umpires, depending on their mood. And right at match point, gorged on pies, pepperoni and Pepsi, they could let loose with a volcanic, synchronized belch.

Democrats have serious voter turnout problems;Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway. American Democrats look worse and worse with every one of these obviously manipulative ploys for power they throw out there.

Is this our memory of the recent past abetting our consumer standards ( e.g KFC). The abominable academic performance in essential subjects of american high school and college students compared to their peers almost everywhere appears flaunted. Many of us are savaged !! We now again underscore to the world our image of single-minded pursuit of lucre despite globally acknowledged ignorance of everything un-american. Perhaps, this is just a hopeful gambit by the staff of that university to attract humanities funding in todays financial debacle by creating a disgraceful forum . If such is the case I view it as a torpid machination the non-american media will never forget . Is this to be our Freedom in the 21st century as it further encourages the american death of intellectual of respect from the entire world (some US states even purport liberty-like credos). This must be pursued !

However, when you charge the overweight or the smoker extra, please also charge the motorcycle owner, the weekend skier or mountain climber, the underweight, insert your own risk factor here. I also do not care whether employers choose the more attractive of candidates, as they usually do. The effect of good looks and pleasing appearance is well known to every one of us who doesn't have all that much of it. The geeks have been laughing all the way to the bank for years.

The conclusion there was a ""population bomb"" was proven, incontrovertibly the so-called experts said at the time, by a statistical extrapolation of past events which assumed that what had occurred in the past would continue to occur in the future, with no factoring in of the many independent adaptations which were made by people everywhere as a result of the situation. These adaptations largely occurred as a result of natural forces such as increasing costs, the search for greater productivity, the search for a higher standard of living, and not as a result of government actions, not because of a lot of ""we have to do this"" or ""we have to do that"". It is because of situations like the ""population bomb"" scare that people are skeptical about scientists and environmentalists and their proposed actions on a climate change, and that skepticism is justified."

Yes there are jobs for people who major in the humanities and I think it goes without saying that second language proficiency is valued in a global economy. I had requirements in science and math that have helped me translate technical documents, just as requirements in the humanities can help science and business majors develop other skills that will prove equally useful one day.

These people should know that their words are like bullets and they they can expect return fire from those of us who may think differently. This is still America where contrary opinions are both legal and valuable if we are ever to be able to compromise and get results for the people. Our system is designed to take into consideration all views and to come to some compromise. Even the President welcomes competing opinions. Shouldn't writers?

The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.

The result is the Tea Party movement, a group of people who repeat buzz words with no understanding of their true meaning.

What we need are policies to make it as easy as possible to vote. No more nonsense such as moving polling places off college campuses. limiting voting hours to narrow windows of time, decreasing the number of polling places so people must wait hours to vote, and any other shifty tactics I'm missing in this list. These are the tactics that make me increasingly uneasy about the integrity of elections in the U.S.

This;I beg to disagree. Students will be called upon to answer essay questions in examinatons. At work, they will draft numerous emails and memoranda. Such activities proceed quickly and permit only cursory revision. A student with good writing skills will write a reasonable first draft at a reasonable speed. I don't think anyone expects such an essay to be as polished as a paper that has been revised and honed to perfection, or that had the input of 11 colleagues. But it will be pretty obvious whether the kid can write competently or not. I do understand that some kids have been memorizing essays for the SAT's. This form of cheating will be eliminated in the new test, which assigns topics.

The surreality of his vision of the judicial role as that of an 'objective' umpire has long been clear, emphatically since the Court's scandalous intellectual prostitution in Bush vs. Gore. Lying to the public about the all too human nature of judges and courts will only add to our cynicism as each nakedly biased opinion rolls out. Better to admit that objectivity, elusive in any setting, is unavailable to judges, creatures beholden to political forces at every stage of their careers. Justice Ginsburg's comments were a breath of fresh air amid the hypocrisy of such as the good professor.
538;22994;ritual adult life;1;2;to be a good citizen person not influenced informed;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for campaign finance reform and reduce the influence of special interest groups in elections, emphasizing it as a non-partisan issue.;Mandatory voting would make matters worse;Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue. It is one that goes to core values of all Americans.
539;15515;documented vs. undocumented immigrant;0;2;to be a good citizen able work in control legal;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for granting legal status to undocumented immigrants.;the documented are identified by official documents while the undocumented are not;The difference between documented and undocumented is clearly that the documented are identified by official documents while the undocumented are not. Providing ids means that the holders are identified by official documents. While those who applied before coming here are eligible for whatever their documents stipulate those who just showed up have whatever they have been able to take for themselves. De facto the undocumented become documented regardless of whether they followed the official rules or ignored them, and both are effectively officially entitled to act however they have been. Effectively the IDs would make people into legitimate residents and workers, making visas and work permits meaningless obstacles to anyone who wishes to live and to work here. It would be better to just provide all undocumented with legal status provided that they apply and complete the formal process. At least the brazen criminals might be identified and deported.

I guess it IS optional as long as parents allow them to move back into the family home, pick up the cost of their health insurance/car insurance and generally allow them to be perpetual 16 yr olds who can have sleepovers with the opposite sex. This would not be an option if parents were not going along with this. I hear over and over people saying ""I'm afraid he'll end up homeless or in a shelter"". Perhaps hitting rock bottom is what these young people need as a wake-up call."

Ms Fernandez comments about crowd noise betray what I think must be her lack of experience actually playing tennis. I dare anyone to endure playing amid the noise and distraction of a boisterous crowd and say that it didn't affect the quality of their game. The concentration and intensity required to play tournament tennis just can't tolerate it. As for Mr. Dizikes' comments, I couldn't agree more. The game is immensely improved by the absence of the antics of the likes of Nastase, Connors, and McEnroe. All credit to the gentlemen of the game. Fashion? For this tennis player and fan, there is something wonderful about the return of Wimbledon every year...the sense of history, the traditions, the civility, and yes, the white clothing. Roger Federer, the quintessence of elegance in his play, comportment, and in his ""whites"", incomparable."

BRAVO, MAYOR!!!;This city is being destroyed by cars and their pollution. The no idling laws are never enforced and drivers obliviously idle while making cell phone calls or sleeping or doing any number of things. Bikes have a zero carbon footprint or as close to it as you can get. Why are we deferring to the drivers? why is a 3000 pound hunk of toxic gas emitting metal more important than a bike. The bike is clearly superior in that it respects the environment creating no air or noise pollution.To revert back to a bike lane free city is to go back into the dark ages of this city. The paradigm must change.Drivers need to realize that one person on a bike is just as important as one person in a car.They are just two people trying to get where they are going..one quietly and the other creating a swath of noise and filth behind them. It is selfish and unfair for a single driver in a vehicle to insist that they deserve more of the street than the thousands who have risked their lives to do their part to help save the environment. LONG LIVE THE BIKE LANES!!!!! BRAVO, MAYOR!!!

People are defiant when they are addicted to a substance and just forcing something on them can have an even greater negative effect if they aren't ready to accept they have a problem. If the person truly wants help them help should be available but not forced. When an addict has there white flag waving that they are done with that life then a program should be ready to get them into a correct treatment facility.

My commute is not long, from the west 100's to 60th st and Madison and so can even take advantage of central park as well as the bike lanes. I soon found that on the rare occasions when I could bike successfully without some heart stopping near or actual accident which most often caused by pedestrians not looking at bike lanes, that when I did arrive at my destination there were few if any places to lock my bike. So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment. I am afraid my experience is not unique. I expect that unless proper parking locking facilities are provided in sufficient amount and locations the experiment will continue to serve a very small part of the population. As the accidents and injuries add up the city will eventually be forced to abandon this wasteful poorly thought out experiment..

In agreement with you Peter, that not only will it create jobs and create a more sustainable mode of transportation, but in addition, create hubs of commerce that are attached to the rail system. Plans show well designed station centers that integrate commercial spaces and could also provide mobile business centers. If executed very well and with innovation, the future could hold a whole new way of doing business and working in general. It would also alleviate the pressured economics of centralized Bay Area. Thanks for thoughts and comments

Yes!!! The answer is not debatable. The evidence for this is voluminous, ubiquitous and unambiguous. The Orlando gun rampage and the immolation of 38 people in a gay bar in New Orleans are logical outcomes of ""Christian"" belief systems which have socialized followers to disdain LGBT people. The holocaust was similarly inspired. Congressman Rick Allen recently called for the death of homosexuals: according to Roll Call, ""[he] stands by his actions."" So is it debatable That Christians have created a harmful atmosphere for Gays? No. It's just a fact."

This will promote more bicycle riding in town and make riding safer. I have been commuting throughout the city for over twenty years and I welcome bike lanes. What I don't like is the design and implimentation of these lanes. We don't need islands separating bike lanes from car lanes. This makes it more dangerous for both rider and pedestrians. Pedestrians are often not looking when they cross through bike lanes. Also, the wasted space of in many areas around Time Square. The Broadway bike lane just stops at 47th Street! What's up with that? It all seems to be designed by someone that is not a seasoned rider. Watch the messengers... Are they using the bike lanes? Not likely....

No exceptions. To place Christianity under a microscope, and focus only on the evil done in its name while ignoring the enormous good that it has done in the world, is a gross injustice. One needs to go back and see what the world was like without Christianity. It was not the utopia you think it was or will be. I'm shocked that educated people would be so uneducated about history, so unbalanced in their approach to this issue, and so willing to be the intolerance they say they hate.
552;18818;teacher;1;1;to be in charge help the children not responsible poor;the intention of the tweet towards 'teacher' is to criticize the responsibility of raising children being passed onto schools and to advocate for addressing issues like poverty and working conditions to improve the living conditions of students and their families.;Dumping more and more responsibilities into the schools' laps only enables the parents;As a public school teacher, it is not my job to raise children. They have parents for that. Dumping more and more responsibilities into the schools' laps only enables the parents who are choosing to abdicate those responsibilities. While I recognize that there are many factors that make it challenging for some parents to fully meet their children's needs (physical, emotional, educational, economic, etc.), passing those off onto schools, as Canada advocates, is not the answer. I don't think we'll see any real change in this country until we address issues like poverty and working conditions (including the long hours that force parents to choose between seeing their children and feeding them). Incidentally, I am completely baffled and frustrated by Canada, whose success comes largely from the fact that his programs have taken huge steps to improve the living conditions of his students and their families--and then he turns around and credits that success to non-unionized teachers and extended school days. Really??

My kids are in the French system and thank God they are. Here, political correctness is not a way of life as it is in the US; there's a place for all people even if they're not minorities.

They;Yup, just for the few. I don't see why we have to give such a privilege to people who don't respect traffic rules. Most of bikers in the city don't even stop at a light. They pass by us with the speed of a car. I've seen them riding on sidewalks, brushing or even frightening pedestrians many times. Instead of giving them their lane, require them a rider's license or something so that they will follow the basic rules such as stopping at a light.

The Daily KOS for example has flagged more negative views on Hillary than any other Progressive site. This is NOT freedom of speech when others have the power to silence your opinion. And even the NYT was guilty of a lack of attention to Sanders campaign for awhile. Yet Trump has garnished more free publicity than them all because of the increased readership draw, therefore more profits in their advertising dollars. And around the world we are laughed at because we have a reality show candidate, another family oligarch, and all the other clowns on the Republican wagon. Welcome to the Freakshow.

However, when you charge the overweight or the smoker extra, please also charge the motorcycle owner, the weekend skier or mountain climber, the underweight, insert your own risk factor here. I also do not care whether employers choose the more attractive of candidates, as they usually do. The effect of good looks and pleasing appearance is well known to every one of us who doesn't have all that much of it. The geeks have been laughing all the way to the bank for years.

She gets emails from one or two disgruntled students at the end of every semester complaining about the grade she gave them. What is to stop any of these teenagers, who are proven to have an undeveloped frontal lobe and thus lack the capacity for realizing the consequences of their choices, from bringing a gun to her readily accessible office and shooting her? The student may go to jail, but my daughter will be dead. That is my fear.

Even though we know that justices have political considerations and that is usually what gets them considered or nominated to the Court in the first place. The public is not a fool, Professor, and it would be refreshing for you to come down from the ivory tower and look around here at us commoners who daily live with the lies and half-truths of advertising and realize that we know that there is more to a judicial decision than the purity of the law. Moreover, you have to ask how great the crisis has to be for a member of the Court, who knows about keeping silence, to speak out. Remember Joe McCarthy, Professor? Thank god for Joseph Welch, a lawyer, who finally spoke up and discredited him. Ginsberg's brave act was an act of conscience."

Had we known the future of the path set upon 4 years ago they would have been better off jumping ship then. Now, the people have fewer resources with which to endure what's coming but the alternatives offer nothing good in the short run. Long-term, if the Euro survives (a real question in my mind) then Greece will miss out but that's a bet not worth taking at this time. They should exit, sooner rather than later.

People used die early, sixty was old but now people live a lot longer so there is no hurry. People also used to have as many kids as they could because so many died in childhood, modern medicine has put an end to the need for that. Maybe it is just natural part of human evolution as people have become more educated and science has solved many of the problems of dieing off before life could be fully lived.

The body just won't let you."" This is incorrect, and could lead to fatalism that could harm people who are overweight. For example, I lost 70 pounds. That was at least a year ago. It has not come back. It is easy to keep off. The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day. Exercise has also been shown to help prevent the return of weight, though it isn't useful as a weight loss tool. Sadly, what is known today is far different from the older diet and exercise advice that many still follow."

But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.

As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem? Clearly, none of the debaters has really given much thought about the many ramifications of their recommendations.

I dont think she should continue as justice if Trump gets in comments like hers would likely interfere with her ability to judge fairly, but this is just another desperate move of the Dems to try to steal the office from Trump.

Now I live in the NY 15th represented currently by Rep. Rangel. Following scandal, he was in reelected in the Democratic primary with a completely unimpressive 22,000 votes. Democracy in NYC is a joke. Voting only encourages people such as Rangel. If congressional district lines are drawn to ensure Democratic incumbent continuity, the best response is to ignore the voting process.

If the goal is to reign in healthcare costs, it seems to be a far better idea to use the negotiating power of the government (and ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations) to hold healthcare providers accountable for ineffective and unnecessary testing and procedures. What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit. ""Now that we take that as a given, what is the best plan we can come up with?"""

I majored in Psychology, and took as many courses in English, Latin, and Music as I could cram in. I was accepted, and had a satisfying career in Pediatric Surgery. I congratulate McGill in not forcing applicants to have a unidimensional premedical education in science, and hope that I was a better Dr. for it.

There are some things that are just not meant to be governed by greed, and healthcare is one. You want to turn health care for the elderly into a used car lot? The elderly are perhaps the ultimate prey, and you want to unleash the healthcare vultures on them? Look around at the civilized world, look at Medicare compared to our current insurance companies, and you can tell me with a straight face that this is the direction we should go? You have let your ideology build a bubble from rationalization and denial of the real world. Leave used car lots for cars, not health care.

As americans, don't we all want as many people to vote as possible? Isn't that what our country is all about? Not winning, but participation? We should all be striving to get as many people to vote as possible.

When I was young in the late '70s and early '80s, I was adamantly against any type of mandatory government issued ID. I was then and still am a liberal/progressive individual, and I have always been pro-privacy rights. But in today's world, where every entity we deal with in commerce has every speck of data on us, there's really nothing to fight about anymore. In fact, it would be much easier if we all had a government ID. The ID could take the form of a state driver's license or state ID. It must be free to obtain and universally available. It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time. If this were the case, we'd no longer have these debates about IDs and employment, voting, housing, serving on a jury, commerce and travel. The only reason to oppose a national ID is because you want to ensure that people here illegally can still participate in all functions that a citizen can, and that's not a good reason.

Mr. Fenton had every right to burn the Qur'an and should not have been fired, and I fully support his right to do so and believe he should be given his job back.

UNC was America's first public university, with free tuition for all NC residents, because NC wished to have an educated populace. Unfortunately, females and blacks were not admitted to UNC as were white males, though this has changed. And also unfortunately, UNC no longer offers free tuition, and tuition/fees have risen while admission has become much more difficult. I am a UNC graduate who also has been UNC faculty, and my father and daughters have been UNC graduates. Perhaps if UNC ceased paying top administrators and coaches outrageous salaries and perks, students could again earn degrees without having large debts to pay.

Many show no regard for red lights, one way streets, or for even using the lanes. Getting out of a car or cab is hazardous as many cyclists do not use the bike lanes and instead use the other side of the street and then complain when doors open etc. and endager them. Similarly, one now has to assume that a cyclist will ride through an intersection regardless of the traffic light, endagering pedestrians.

Even with broad support of a political party, it is important, vital, moral even, for everyone to call out Trump for what he represents. He represents not democracy, but the corosion of democracy. There has never been a candidate that so clearly neither deserves to be even considered for candidacy let lone to be a candidate. He is hateful, authoritarian, and uses the most base elements of our fears and discomfort against a wall of lies. How dare YOU not call him out w/o the same level of passion and vigor? You have normalized him and that is a crime in and of itself. Where is your critical journalism?

New York City has had such a strong anti-bicycling stance for so many decades (remember Koch's midtown bike ban? remember when bicycling was prohibited on the GWB walkway?) that it's going to take awhile for some cyclists to start poking their heads out again. When less intrepid cyclists realize that bicycling is actually being encouraged, not discouraged, they'll give it a try. It's going to take time for the full value of dedicated bike lanes to be realized. Sorry, I can't sign onto the position of car advocates. They're probably climate change deniers, as well.

The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.

And in my experience, most cities have a variety of acceptable ways to get around on a bike. New York is different. The one-way avenues are hazardous, even for experienced bikers.

This tells me everything I need to know about both this man and the state of our government run secondary education. In that, it is not so much education as it is indoctrination of young adults. Most of the adults that will be carrying a firearm will be 21, have gone through a background check on both the Federal and state level, and in many cases gone through some sort of required training. These are the most law abiding, mature, and responsible people in society. To demonize them shows a political agenda to strip citizens of their enumerated and natural rights.

Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.

As for Greece it self I see dark times for its citizens for thinking they could live of the hog of the EU and not play by the rules.

Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.

We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy. We don't know the outcomes if other students and teachers packed weapons. Speculation is easy. What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon? Do we really want to find out? At a controversial football game, would someone kill the umpire? Doug Giebel Big Sandy, Montana

NYC is not some utopian, hippie commune for the anti-car crowd, this is a city built upon business, where people need to actually get around in a hurry. Mayor Bloomberg is just making matters worse with his futile attempts to change the way we all behave either by force, cost or inconvenience. Despite his best efforts, the Mayor can not be Mayor forever, and after all of his heavy-handed attacks on personal freedoms, New Yorkers may be ready for someone who just balances the budget and leaves them alone. I know I am. We pay a lot of money to live in NYC - we should have the right to smoke, drive cars, eat salt and drink soda. I think Mr. Bloomberg needs to be President, because as Mr. Obama has demonstrated, the President can't change a thing.

Unfortunately their disease can be contagious, but usually infects very few. Like leprosy. Sometimes it infects nations as in WW II. The fact is that those waving the bloody rainbows are martyrs of their own making, torturing themselves with hatred and poison. They are addicted to being twisted and gaining pleasure by hurting others. But they damage themselves more than others, feeding on their addiction. The are empty. Hollow. Hopeless. And alone. They are their own worst enemies. The martyrs at the Pulse club died celebrating life. While the ghouls who wave bloody rainbow banners live while celebrating death.

And most college women would not realistically be at an advantage even if armed at the fraternity parties, where preying upon them often occurs. Perhaps he should try to replace some of those in the growing exodus of more thoughtful professors from UT, where he and his students could soon defend one another and even potentially have a good ole shootout with one another should tensions arise in Austin. The claim that ""armed citizens frequently save lives and prevent violent crimes, often without firing a shot"", is largely a myth and not backed up with any valid stats, though it is true that most law-abiding gunowners have a dream about saving others ironically from fellow gunowners at some point, and it may seem like a nice dream."

They made a choice to go into serious debt and now they must accept it and figure out how to deal with it. That's part of the growing up thing. Before they selected a college to attend, they should have sat down with their parents and determined which college was most affordable for them, not which college would be the grooviest to attend. Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives. Too bad they don't have truly serious issues facing them, like the possibility of being drafted and sent off to fight America's overseas wars. There's an example of somebody else making a choice for you that you have absolutely no choice in the matter, other than defying the law, going to prison (like Muhammad Ali), or leaving the country. I don't today's younger generation has the courage to make those kinds choices because it may disrupt their social media activity.

The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of ""I forgot to turn my camera on,"" of course, but it's a vast improvement over ""I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work.""

It's going to take time for the full value of dedicated bike lanes to be realized. Sorry, I can't sign onto the position of car advocates. They're probably climate change deniers, as well.

Regardless of being off-duty, if he was clearly identifying himself as a Transit employee he's very likely still subject to the Transit code of conduct. Most New York firefighters wear NYFD t-shirts when off duty, at least some of the time. the same goes for New York police and NYPD t-shirts. If Mr. Fenton was doing the same, there's a strong case that he's acting as a representative of the NJ Transit Authority rather than a private citizen. Keep in mind two things folks. First, if he'd burned a Christian Bible lynch mobs would be forming. Second, the only protection this idiot has from being fired is that he works for a government office.

It's an opportunity, albeit a huge spectacle, to remind us that we're all on the same planet, where we can compete on the field with sport, not war. Brazil is one of my favorite countries, with a rich culture and a special joie de vivre not found in many other places. It's unfortunate and sad that their political problems have brought the situation to where it is now....but, political corruption is not really anything new, and not limited to Brazil. I've lived for years in dangerous mosquito zones (zika, chikunguniya, dengue, malaria) and stayed healthy by taking preventative measures. Olympic goers need to be educated about how best to prevent mosquito bites, the place needs to be sprayed, and an easy test people should be readily available for people returning home. Furthermore, the Olympics represent the dream of a lifetime for all the athletes who train so hard to get in. Let the games go on!

For example is it simply amazing that Justice Roberts cannot find anything in the Constitution that supports equal rights to marriage for all people!

The research he manages to find always seems to reinforce his preferred narrative, no matter how little it resembles reality. Back in reality, tenure is basically a rule that allows the firing of bad teachers while prohibiting the firing of good ones. Like any rule implemented by human beings, it can be derailed by incompetent supervisors, but the rule itself doesn't protect bad teachers. It protects good ones. Ending tenure doesn't make it any easier for a competent administrator to fire a bad teacher, but it DOES make it easier for an incompetent administrator to fire a GOOD teacher. Hanushek is rarely on the right side of issues, and he doesn't surprise here.

Me too. Maybe I will look to move overseas; after all, in the scientific field in which I work, Europeans are increasingly no longer attending conferences in the United States due to our policy extremes. The growing acceptance of the idea that America is an intrinsically violent society is part of so many of our problems. It fits with our inability to deal with our racist heritage, fear of new immigrants, and the economic vibe that one's own personal wealth is all that matters, and horrific experiences like the author recounts."

Leviticus 20 not only condemns homosexuality, it calls for the death penalty. Does the author support the killing of gays, as his infallible Bible directs? Or is he already slicing and dicing and choosing which parts of the Bible he believes are true and infallible? It would seem to me Mr. Daly is either a monster or a hypocrite, of his own making.

If the goal is to reign in healthcare costs, it seems to be a far better idea to use the negotiating power of the government (and ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations) to hold healthcare providers accountable for ineffective and unnecessary testing and procedures. What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit. ""Now that we take that as a given, what is the best plan we can come up with?"""

Take French for example. While not a major language here in the US, it is spoken in large parts of Africa and is an official language of most of the major international organizations including the UN. In fact, in my work as a project manager with an international public health organization, it was actually my French studies that were the MOST directly relevant part of my academic background, and fluent French were highly valued for their language skills.

How was that left out here? It's like to a whole bunch of powerful people, climate change is something to be discussed in the context of bad emissions by developing nations, but never with regard to actually changing patterns of domestic production or consumption by the developed nations that did the most to get us where we are.

Pope Francis recently called the Catholic church on its obsession with abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control. Such obsessions are narrow and negative and tend to miss Christ's main message: to treat persons as persons, not use them as objects. IMHO this means we should be more concerned about one person using or abusing another than about what two consenting adults do to express their love for each other.

Gore). In the case of Trump, demanding that justices should be neutral is like saying the justices should not stop an imminent threat against their person or another citizen --but wait for a case to come before the court. There are some threats that common decency, patriotism and self-preservation demand immediate action. Denouncing the demagogue Trump falls into that category.

We need a Supreme Court that is willing to enforce the Constitution;John Wilkes Booth murdered Abraham Lincoln because Lincoln advocated giving the rights of citizenship to black Americans. Our problem is that the members of the Supreme Court that ruled to stop enforcing the Voting Rights Act do not have Civil War Veterans in their families. Their families were in Europe in the 1860's, not on the blood-soaked American battlefields where slavery was abolished with heavy caliber rifles. We have a constitution. We need a Supreme Court that is willing to enforce the Constitution.

The government realized it would not be able to property maintain this arsenal and agreed, by treaty, to relinquish it on the basis that the USA and UK agreed to defend its territorial integrity. Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands. The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of nuclear weapons, and will hold on to existing arsenals or attempt to develop one. Such passive encouragement of nuclear arms proliferation is contrary to the stated policy of the Western world to promote the reduction of such weapons. Who will trust the US when approached to eliminate its nuclear arms program?

We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps. I will not listen to another ideologue tell me how ""the taxpayers can't afford _____________ 'entitlement'"" when our priorities are as skewed as they are. The taxpayers--and all those private donors--can afford PLENTY; it's what they're willing to spend it on that's the problem. I can't take someone seriously who claims, essentially, that qualified students shouldn't have affordable or free tuition because of football."

AlphaGo did not win because it learns and thinks in a human way, whatever that means. It won because it played better moves based on an algorithm which has nothing to do human mental processes. It might be good to find debaters who actually know what they are talking about. Calling for some undefined overhaul in our education system to deal with an era of smarter machines sounds good, but actually doesn't mean anything. We cannot even overhaul our education system so kids can read and write and do arithmetic; how are we going to overhaul it to deal with smart machines?"

They found that overall, Christians have become more accepting of LGBT people, but among Evangelical Christians acceptance still hovers at 36%. Among American Muslims acceptance has also gone up and is 45%. Given the rhetoric of many who target American Muslims as purveyors of radical and hateful feelings towards Americans, and argue that Christians love the sinner hate the sin, they should ask themselves why so many of them refuse to accept fellow Americans.

The salient thing about school teachers or college students HAVING the right to carry a gun is that there is simply no blanket reliance for the criminal intruder that everyone he sees will not be armed. This fact, hated by progressives, is the key. It never involves everyone with that right taking advantage of it.

They don't want to give up a car lane like on Prospect Park West, so they make up some crap about safety, as though there are hundreds of cyclists knocking people over. Most cyclists who use the protected lanes are polite and content that they feel safe and abide by the rules.

That said, it is also one of the greatest privileges offered to the American people, and the idea that a privilege should not require some effort to take advantage of has wrongly become embedded in too much commentary in this country. We have freedom of speech, legally protected, but with political correctness rampant in our universities and communities, and people (often from the same disadvantaged groups complaining about voting rights) demonstrating and shouting down any opinions but theirs, I have to say that protection of folks relative to laws is a meaningless protection at best. Indeed, if those folks worried about voting rights took as much time voting and making sure they can as they did demonstrating about it, there would not be a problem with peoples ability to vote at all. And don't even get me started on government overreach at being big brother that makes us afraid to say anything in public, out loud, or online. So much for free speech! Let's protect voting the same way????!!!!!

Certainly there are prejudices among certain Christians against gays, but none have them rise, for instance, to government imposing the death penalty for homosexual acts, as is the case in many Muslim countries. If you wanted to intentionally promote demagogues like Donald Trump, you couldn't to a better job. His type gains strength every time the media so consciously ignores the truth as it has down here, and by ignoring the truth gives credence to his distorted messages. Nice job.

We have a constant push for more;Professor Nussbaum speaks a vital truth. We have a constant push for more science and mathematics, more technology majors. The assumption is that we are losing the international sweepstakes if we don't excel other nations in these fields. We want to make the Faustian bargain, in which we choose to gain the whole world, technical ascendancy, by forfeiting our soul, the humanities. The error here, as Professor Nussbaum says, is in assuming that the two areas of study are unrelated and separable, which they are not. The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society. That ignorance extends to those who are leading the reactionaries. They also stand in great need of education in such skills as critical thinking, and in the narrative and conceptual history of their own nation.

Also, in common with other people who say the HSR project should simply be scrapped, professor White names zero alternatives. How, I wonder, does he propose to deal with the huge population increases projected to take place in California in the coming decades? How does he plan to move those people between the cities? As another contributor has already shown, simply building more highways or more airports will cost just as much, if not more, than HSR, and they'll soon be congested as well. It's no secret that the project has been bungled, but when it comes to efficient use of energy and space and passenger convenience, nothing beats rail.

The people who rent cycles to tourists don't bother telling them they aren't allowed to ride on the sidewalks or the footpaths in central Park. The pedicabs are now just as bad and they're carrying naive tourists in the back seat on a ride to catastrophe.

I delight in my oldest daughter's decision to attend Tulane in New Orleans and my youngest daughter's decision to take Latin in high school. Both are interested in the wider world of diversity, multi-culturalism, and a new century that may not throw away the baby with the bathwater. Sadly the defense of humanites including French stands as much chance of success as the Maginot Line in 1940. Quis a dedecus

Trump is definitely a fascist and we should hear this truth spoken by many more honest folk. Some within Congress speak lies in their support of Trump so why not hear truth spoken ? One lie must be corrected here : Trump is NOT an evangelical as he and others lie about. He is a fundamentalist who thinks he only speaks truth. Clinton may have made a mistake, but Trump IS a mistake and is totally opposed to a true democracy, as are those in Congress who want rule by the NRA and not the people. WE THE PEOPLE must speak out and Ginsberg is brave for speaking truth.

Voters who don't care and aren't going to bother learning anything about the issues are going to be the ideal targets for campaign ads designed not to inform, but to simply build a meaningless yet favorable association between the voter and the candidate. Promoting voter turnout is only of benefit to society if those voters are educated voters.

He quit too soon. The key is segregating bikes from cars. The cement barriers of the Koch lanes would have defined the boundaries and let everyone know where they belonged and did not belong. Establishing bike only cross town and north-south streets would tick off motorists, but certainly create safer transportation. It is time for change. Cyclists need to be as accountable as cab drivers when they do stupid, and the rest of us need to learn how to deal with positive change.

Nobody forced them to do that. They made a;Milliennials burdened by college debt? They chose to take out that debt. Nobody forced them to do that. They made a choice to go into serious debt and now they must accept it and figure out how to deal with it. That's part of the growing up thing. Before they selected a college to attend, they should have sat down with their parents and determined which college was most affordable for them, not which college would be the grooviest to attend. Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives. Too bad they don't have truly serious issues facing them, like the possibility of being drafted and sent off to fight America's overseas wars. There's an example of somebody else making a choice for you that you have absolutely no choice in the matter, other than defying the law, going to prison (like Muhammad Ali), or leaving the country. I don't today's younger generation has the courage to make those kinds choices because it may disrupt their social media activity.
672;22651;new york 's bike lane;0;2;to get somewhere quickly faster fast;the user expresses frustration with the high-speed rail proposal, advocating for expanded standard and light rail, improved connectivity in the existing system, addition of express trains, and better station conditions.;CAN WE NOT JUST EXPAND STANDARD & LIGHT RAIL;WHY CAN WE NOT JUST EXPAND STANDARD & LIGHT RAIL? That's what I don't get about this high-speed rail proposal, it's obsession with a few big cities while the rest of the system languishes like it's been for decades. I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus. If they want some faster routes, why not lay on some EXPRESS trains which do not stop at the smaller cities in between? Lastly the biggest problem in public acceptance is the sorry state of many stations. Nobody wants to wait in a station in a larger city or use it's bathrooms.
673;4708;ignorant voters;0;0;to be in charge power control make a difference;the intention of the tweet is to criticize ignorant voters and advocate for college graduates to have more influence in the political process.;those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote;I would be in favor of the following. At least one of the two chambers (presumably the Senate) should ONLY have voters who have graduated from college. Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish. Of course Democrats have their own banks of ignorant voters, the sin is shared by the parties.
674;19364;french departments in school;0;1;to learn something new make a point be understood about;the user expresses disappointment and seeks discussion on the importance of french departments in colleges, questioning the debate's focus and depth of knowledge about french culture and language.;If the debate was not about French departments then there is a subtle English code that I fail;As a French-speaking Canadian who obviously understands English, when I saw the title of the article I was looking forward to the debaters' comments. Yet no one answers the question: do colleges need French departments? Nobody mentions the unique perspective French culture, literature, philosophy and language can bring to students. Nor does any debater write about the worthlessness of French, should that be their opinion. Were there no debaters who knew something about French? And when I mention French, I refer to all countries that, through history and to this day, have lived and still live in French as well as those countries, such as the United States, that have pockets of citizens that live and think in French. If the debate was not about French departments then there is a subtle English code that I fail to decrypt.

The court is an enforcer of Oligarchy. It is insane to invest that much power in 5 people, especially lawyers, who typically have a very technically narrow to the point of warped, view on reality. Supreme Court terms should be limited to 12 years with staggered appointments. Congress and the president should be able to override Court decisions with follow up votes.

Though in many ways Trump is a buffoon parody of those leaders, the energies he releases and channels are frighteningly similar to the ones they exploited to work their evil. Perhaps recognizing that, she feels this is one of those moments when precedent must yield to the moral imperative to resist evil.

Countries that distort their investment and social policies in hosting lavish international events (think Greece) are more numerous than those who wisely invest to help build their cities and countries. In addition to the direct impacts on the citizens can be huge. This is not an issue of politics, it is an issue of common sense and good public policy.

When people think they're just fine, but they're beating up their elderly parents (who won't press charges, believing that home is the safest place for their wayward offspring), then they need to be forcibly removed and treated. They may have severe emotional problems, but they're still a menace. When people addicted to drugs follow old ladies home from the bank, push them down, and steal their pocketbooks, fracturing their hips and forearms in the bargain, they need to be removed from society. They may be addicts, but they're also criminals. Sorry I am for all suffering. But not that sorry for either the addled or the addicts who think they are right and refuse treatment.

When I was in school, one of the best history teachers in the district was forced to retire early because a few African American parents didn't like how he taught the Civil War. Now around here in CA, Latino families are objecting to how American history books teach the Mexican-American War. People have a lot of different opinions. Liberals want their way of thinking taught, conservatives want theirs. There has to be some way for schools to deal with this other than bowing down to the pressure of the most vocal parents.

Leaving aside whether that is an accurate assessment, the fact is that Justice Ginsburg had an opportunity to set an example of respecting the wall between the judiciary and partisan politics. She chose to further dismantle it."

Thankfully New York, along with Montreal, has the wisdom to prohibit right turns on a red light. We need to give those that bike or walk not just equal rights to those that drive, but, to provide a city infrastructure that respects them. Bike lanes are just a start.

Surprisingly this is the same guy who got upset when Mr. Trump rightfully pointed out that a judge who is a member of La Raza should be recused. The author likes to call Mr. Trump fascist, among other things, but seems to have no problem with the racist currently ruining the country. If the Supreme court judges have to sit quietly during state of the union speeches than she should shut up now. All she has done was show her bias. Thankfully, once Mr. Trump is elected we can get judges with brains on the court.

Mankind would have died out eons ago if we'd all waited. But then we lived VERY modestly on one income so we had no child care expenses. Anyone who graduates from college with 6 figure student loans is a fool - there are ways to get a college education without doing that. I agree that those with only a high school diploma absolutely must delay children until they achieve some financial stability - if they don't, they'll have a lifetime of poverty. But all these college-educated young who are delaying parenthood until their forties so they can obtain all the material things they desire and take all the trips are only fooling themselves. This is financial responsibility - this is an avoidance of adulthood.

And therein lies the problem for Christians (and many other religionists). Dreher and other believers think they have a monopoly on ""the truth."" How is this possible? Dreher offers up the tired bromide that ""The Bible tells me so!"" Well then, why do other sacred texts tell their adherents something different? And who wrote the Bible, anyway? How did they know ""the truth?"" If the Bible were introduced as evidence in a court of law, it would be rejected out of hand as hearsay. Dreher can't bring himself to a more obvious ""truth,"" which is that all religious belief is opinion, grounded in little, if any, demonstrable fact."

Young teachers, especially in the most challenging urban districts need support and mentoring. The high turnover rate will only get higher if this new ruling prevails. Administrators and school districts in general need to provide ongoing support for new teachers in the form of mentors, aides, and constant feedback. It's a difficult job.

689;4469;musicians;0;1;to listen music be entertained something;the intention of the tweet towards target'musicians' is to express frustration with the decline in quality of recorded music and the impact it has on the experience of listening to music, particularly in a live setting.;There is no substitute for being in a room with musicians and others who share the feeling,;Convenience is opposed to quality. We have been a downward spiral of quality of experience from live music. The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age. I find it ironic that our computers are now fast enough to handle High Def but the information content of recording has been decreasing and the bit rate of radio is now below standard streaming, even on Classical stations like WQXR. There is no substitute for being in a room with musicians and others who share the feeling, and the easier it is to get low quality music, the less we want music of any caliber.

Is this our memory of the recent past abetting our consumer standards ( e.g KFC). The abominable academic performance in essential subjects of american high school and college students compared to their peers almost everywhere appears flaunted. Many of us are savaged !! We now again underscore to the world our image of single-minded pursuit of lucre despite globally acknowledged ignorance of everything un-american. Perhaps, this is just a hopeful gambit by the staff of that university to attract humanities funding in todays financial debacle by creating a disgraceful forum . If such is the case I view it as a torpid machination the non-american media will never forget . Is this to be our Freedom in the 21st century as it further encourages the american death of intellectual of respect from the entire world (some US states even purport liberty-like credos). This must be pursued !

Obviously then, gay people have been around a long time, and apparently in every culture of humans on the planet. So, how is it that everyone doesn't see this as part of our human nature and just move on, like we do with people with blue eyes or brown hair. It is part of being human. And, if science is correct and we are actually MILLIONS of years old, gays may have been around for even longer. What is it about religions that tend to deny everything that they don;t like? What happened to tolerance and acceptance that they constantly preach?"

We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps. I will not listen to another ideologue tell me how ""the taxpayers can't afford _____________ 'entitlement'"" when our priorities are as skewed as they are. The taxpayers--and all those private donors--can afford PLENTY; it's what they're willing to spend it on that's the problem. I can't take someone seriously who claims, essentially, that qualified students shouldn't have affordable or free tuition because of football."

Not to mention lung-cringing CO, heat-trapping CO2, PAHs, or the sheer waste of precious oil (and human lives) in dragging a tonne of steel, rubber, plastic, and glass around just to move a single person. Car drivers are the spoiled and subsidized minority here -- that is what the CM people are getting at I think: the unspoken and unwritten assumption that the privilege of driving a car should be considered a right.

Both opened university doors to millions of students. I was one of them. With that assistance I made my way into medicine. Others became engineers or researchers. What I know is the nation got a boost of talent, and brought progress to the nation. Mr. Petrilli describes the effect of poverty, and negates the possibility of many to advance themselves and this country. Education even if paid by tax payers does not address every short fall in society, but it does help many. It is time to reject fatalist opinion, and redirect our attention to doing what should be done to improve everyone's survival.

Firstly, the so-called 'Syrian' opposition is and has been all along, largely made up of non-Syrians, imported into Syria for the sole purpose of regime change. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, most of the opposition is made up of ultra-religious jihadi groups, affiliated with al-Qaeda and others. It defies comprehension that anyone in the Western intelligentsia or media would advocate any of these groups over Assad or the government of Syria, or the Kurds who are opposed to all of these groups. What is the game plan here? Is it ISIS and/or jihadi control of Syria, governed b the invisible hand of Saudi Arabia, which is not known for its democratic tendencies? If so, you should go live with the 'opposition' and see how long you last.

But these are not normal times."" And who defines 'normal'? Mr. Butler? So SCOTUS justices should be respectful, impartial bystanders of presidential elections, unless Mr. Butler dislikes that candidate, or decides things aren't 'normal'. In which the SCOTUS can freely brawl in the mud like every other clownish politician. Of course, in these 'abnormal' times, should another justice lash out at Hillary, it's dollars to donuts that Mr. Butler would scream in horror at the indignation and partiality. What a funny sense of justice some people have. Speaking of normal times, the New York Times once published actual news. You know, facts backed with credible sources and evidence. But I guess these aren't normal times, opinions are much flashier and entertaining these days. I suppose Ginsberg's gaffe is a natural evolution of our classless time. And although I'm sure someone will be sorely itching to rattle off Scalia or Thomas and what they did, two wrongs don't make a right do they? The code of conduct should be applicable (and enforced) to ALL judges, including the SCOTUS. Not holding my breath though."

As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout. They would build diesel cars that maximized their profit and that imposed tremendous costs on everyone else. There would be no incentive whatsoever for them to do anything else.

Bicyclists are not former car drivers, they are former mass transit users. Bicycling will not reduce car use, but it will reduce mass transit use. Fewer mass transit users means it is easier to cut mass transit funding etc. Low income residents, the disabled and the elderly rely heavily on mass transit. Bicycling benefits young people. Cycling is great in low density European cities with low-rise buildings - but not in high-density NYC with one high-rise after another. The number of people (particular affluent people who are more likley to have cars, get deliveries such as Frsh Direct etc), the number of skyscrapers etc is the cause of car traffic in NYC.

Yet no one answers the question: do colleges need French departments? Nobody mentions the unique perspective French culture, literature, philosophy and language can bring to students. Nor does any debater write about the worthlessness of French, should that be their opinion. Were there no debaters who knew something about French? And when I mention French, I refer to all countries that, through history and to this day, have lived and still live in French as well as those countries, such as the United States, that have pockets of citizens that live and think in French. If the debate was not about French departments then there is a subtle English code that I fail to decrypt.

The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.

When that so-called ""Christ-like example"" includes raising millions of dollars, as Focus on the Family has repeatedly done, to try to restrict the 1138 rights and privileges conferred by civil marriage in this country to opposite-sex couples only, I have to wonder what Jesus Christ would have to say about that. I suspect he would react to Mr. Daly exactly the way he reacted to the Pharisees of his day, who presumed to have everything all figured out and lorded their supposedly superior knowledge of the infinite over everyone else."

But a minor one, when compared with Russia's larger geopolitical objectives. I believe Russia's hidden motive in Syria, is to use the immigration crisis as a weapon to attack the west. Russia is using the west's own sense of compassion and valuation of human rights, as a weapon against us. By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere. I have long felt that Assad, and his father before him, were the only true impediment to peace in the middle east. Get rid of Assad, and I believe all the other pieces will fall into place.

I guess for some self flagellation is fun and will be taken advantage of any time they can. But this time it is a stretch to rationalize it as appropriate in discussing the events that occurred in Orlando. The United States is primarily christian based civilization where gay marriage is accepted as legal and any number of laws have been enacted that protect gays. Laws written by the democratically elected members of the society. That is legislators who in the majority are elected by mostly Christians. In this free society a non-christian, an avowed Islamist takes his non-Christian, muslim beliefs to the extreme and it is the christians that are to blame? No doubt it can be pointed out that there are other countries that are even more liberal but most if not all of those countries also have a Christian basis. I must admit I have not been to a church in 30 years but the logic of this discussion is absurd on its face. If there is a religion of any relevance in this discussion, it is Islam. If there is a religion in need of fundamental reform it is Islam.

There are legal protections and remedies that all employees have against prejudicial firing. We are dealing with public school teachers, not college professors researching controversial topics who might need special protections. The minute number of teachers actually fired for cause speaks for itself. Additionally the argument that reducing tenure will hurt morale might be true for the bad teachers who jobs are at risk. But how do you think the current system affects the moral of good teachers who year after year see the same basket case co-workers keep their jobs. A system that cleared out the dead wood would improve their morale.

The courts will always be packed with judges who interpret the law one way or the other. Justice Ginsberg has made some extraordinary statements in the past week regarding Donald Trump, a man who has continuously shown outright contempt for our rule of law. It is my belief that Trumps rhetoric is genuine. This is not the typical say-anything to get elected scenario. He will be worse if elected. Many, if not most Republicans are equally concerned. But even if Trump is elected, nothing about Ruth Bader Ginsberg will change. He will get the same exact justice she is today, although she may fight more vigilantly with her more conservative peers. With all that in mind, I think her comments were fine.

Most cyclists who use the protected lanes are polite and content that they feel safe and abide by the rules. It's the cyclists who don't use the lanes that are a problem - they ride too fast, arrogantly riding against traffic, don't look up. We all have to drive carfefully.

Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field. If you have an addiction, any addiction, you should be treated equally in the workplace.

They do not;Kurds are very reliable ally of United States in the Middle East. They do not have any connection with any extremist Islamic group and they are the only group that have been fighting against Isis consistently. In other hand Turkey not only allow many cihadists to use their border to join Isis but also support extremist group in Syria in order to remove the Essad from the power. Turkey never committed to fight against Isis. It allowed US to use its air base last year against Isis but they decided to use that opportunity to bomb Kurdish territories both in Syria and Iraq. How Us can relay on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is using his power to get rid of democratic society. There are many journalists in jail, 1028 academicians were charged because they signed a petition to invite Turkish government to have a peace in southeast Turkey. Us should support Kurds not unreliable Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Bicycles aren't going away. They're not really permitted to use the sidewalks. Bicycles are also the most sensible means of transportation for a good percentage of city residents and workers. Isn't it possible we can learn to live with these safety-providing lanes?

We know, for example, that anabolic steroids make people more muscular and larger. They are also associated with more aggressive behavior. Why should a baseball catcher risk his or her safety to block the plate when a drugged, super-sized, hyper-aggressive base runner is barreling down from third base? The drug user is often risking the safety of those around him.

Unlike fission, fusion uses the most-common element in the universe, hydrogen. With fusion, there are no radioactive byproducts. Fusion is the key to a primarily-electric future (aircraft probably excepted). A lot of money has been spent on fusion research to date. Progress has been made and much learned, but we're a long way from building a useful power plant. It's time we made the sort of commitment to finding the way to make fusion work on a commercial scale.
749;5998;nuclear power;0;1;to be a scientist make point avoid disaster statement;the intention of the tweet towards nuclear power is to correct misinformation and provide accurate information about fukushima disaster, nuclear waste storage, and water usage in nuclear power plants.;Fukushima was NOT a major disaster and was NOT due to seismic problems but;"Ms Oreskes is "" professor of the history of science and an affiliated professor of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University"". In other words she is not a scientist but an historian and her background is in geology NOT in physics. Perhaps this helps to explain why her article is so wrongheaded. Fukushima was NOT a major disaster and was NOT due to seismic problems but the Tsunami. So yes, don't situate nuclear plants on the coast but that does not rule out inland West Coast sites. As for nuclear waste presenting an insurmountable problem, that is nonsense. Once the waste has been vitrified there is no real problem with storage. The problem is people like Ms Oreskes panicking at the thought of possible release of radiation. As for use of water, as others have pointed out it is ""used"" for cooling and then returned to the system."

When people think they're just fine, but they're beating up their elderly parents (who won't press charges, believing that home is the safest place for their wayward offspring), then they need to be forcibly removed and treated. They may have severe emotional problems, but they're still a menace. When people addicted to drugs follow old ladies home from the bank, push them down, and steal their pocketbooks, fracturing their hips and forearms in the bargain, they need to be removed from society. They may be addicts, but they're also criminals. Sorry I am for all suffering. But not that sorry for either the addled or the addicts who think they are right and refuse treatment.
751;3626;carrying a loaded weapon;0;0;to win the game be in control have a weapon gun;the intention of the tweet towards target 'carrying a loaded weapon' is to question the effectiveness of self-defense and the potential for violence in a situation where a person is carrying a weapon.;What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon? Do;Some have questioned whether a gun-carrying woman with a gun pressed against her head would have prevailed had she drawn her weapon. We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy. We don't know the outcomes if other students and teachers packed weapons. Speculation is easy. What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon? Do we really want to find out? At a controversial football game, would someone kill the umpire? Doug Giebel Big Sandy, Montana

Olympic athletes use them, pro wrestlers, mixed martial;This used to anger me, now it doesn't. The drugs are here to stay. Olympic athletes use them, pro wrestlers, mixed martial arts, cyclists, baseball and football players, runners, even the young guys in the gyms around the country. That's why you see so many young men who look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. They don't spend 7 hours in the gym everyday to look like that..They spend about an hour per day, take a boatload of pills, powders and/or some injections, and eat a pretty good diet with low carbs and lots of protein. I can lift as much as a lot of them, but I'm a bald old guy who doesn't inject anything and I look like it. Who the heck wants to look like me? We need to just let it go. If their livers rot out by the time they're 40, that's their problem. They already decided it's worth looking and performing like a stud for a short time, rather than a noodle for a long time.

I think the game should be postpones or moved to another location out of a disease zone. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would want to go to Brazil with an epidemic raging. I will be surprised if attendance is not quite low. It is too risky, from a health point of view to go to those games.

755;4974;stability;0;0;to be a good teacher person get rid of someone make point;the intention of the tweet towards target'stability' is to emphasize the importance of tenure in maintaining stability in the education system.;Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators;Yeah, about what I expected from Petrilli. An attempt to seem reasonable by minimizing the problems with his position and overstating the benefits. Yes, an arbitrarily fired teacher without tenure can sue, and might possibly collect... IF he or she can afford a lawyer, and IF he or she can make it through years of litigation without a job. Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so. It's stupidly simple: tenure is basically a law that says teachers, after several years of service, need to be informed of the reason they're being fired and given a chance to respond to those accusations. Despite a lot of really misleading claims, that's really all it is. And since that system protects good teachers and allows the firing of bad ones, nobody who understands it (and wants the best for kids) will oppose it.
756;15231;not speaking out;0;0;to learn something new understand the situation about history;the intention of the tweet towards target 'not speaking out' is to emphasize the importance of speaking out against injustice and the consequences of not doing so.;Apparently, everyone needs to see the film Judgment at Nuremberg;Apparently, everyone needs to see the film Judgment at Nuremberg, based on transcripts of those trials. It is about the trial of a judge and three lawyers who, by either turning a blind eye (the judge) or actively participating with the National Socialists (the lawyers), helped facilitate the legal apparatus of Hitler's Reich. Simply YouTube the judge's (played by Burt Lancaster) astounding speech toward the latter part of the film and you will see that he laments NOT having spoken out when he could sense where things were going. Yes, it is a MOVIE. But it is based on fact - and deals with the rise of the most dangerous demagogue in history (Hitler), for which Trump's rise is an increasingly eerie parallel.
757;17166;economists;1;1;to understand the situation make a decision be correct learn;the intention of the tweet towards economists is to acknowledge the complexity of economics as a discipline and the importance of disciplined thinking in developing governmental policy, while also acknowledging the challenges of identifying charlatans.;disciplined thinking about the economic aspects of our society is very useful in developing governmental policy;How can anyone lump all economists together? Of course economics is not a science like physics or biology. Neither is sociology or so-called political science. And it is difficult sometimes to identify the charlatans. But disciplined thinking about the economic aspects of our society is very useful in developing governmental policy. Mistakes are made, but more often than not they are made because ideology encourages cherry-picking the facts and gets in the way of careful analysis.

This is not greatness, not deserving of being inducted. The RRHFA inducts too many people because it is an annual event and they need the buzz to get people to visit and keep museum viable.

My hairdresser has somehow amassed enough money to buy and sell large pieces of real estate. I know a young man who makes plenty in his window-washing business, and another friend, who works on computers with a technical-school education, has a house bigger than mine (I have a PhD). A couple of decades ago, we had an addition built on our house, and we used a highly recommended contractor. He told us that, when he graduated from high school, he took the money his father had saved for his college and started a business instead. He is still in business, probably has not had time for college. He has been successful and does good work. I would never minimize the importance of college for those who have a reason to go, but I can't agree with the one-size-fits-all philosophy. There are plenty of important jobs to be done that don't involve college; there are other kinds of skill and knowledge we all depend on."

There are some things that are just not meant to be governed by greed, and healthcare is one. You want to turn health care for the elderly into a used car lot? The elderly are perhaps the ultimate prey, and you want to unleash the healthcare vultures on them? Look around at the civilized world, look at Medicare compared to our current insurance companies, and you can tell me with a straight face that this is the direction we should go? You have let your ideology build a bubble from rationalization and denial of the real world. Leave used car lots for cars, not health care.

The surreality of his vision of the judicial role as that of an 'objective' umpire has long been clear, emphatically since the Court's scandalous intellectual prostitution in Bush vs. Gore. Lying to the public about the all too human nature of judges and courts will only add to our cynicism as each nakedly biased opinion rolls out. Better to admit that objectivity, elusive in any setting, is unavailable to judges, creatures beholden to political forces at every stage of their careers. Justice Ginsburg's comments were a breath of fresh air amid the hypocrisy of such as the good professor.

All the billionaires want one. If they can't be moved nilly willy then they can't extract ransoms from politicians who don't want it to happen to them. Cities, counties or states can lease the rights to manage them to individuals, but they should be held in the commons. Fans pay more and more to attend games, TV audiences sit through unbearable commercials (watch a soccer game- no interruptions) cable costs escalate unendingly. The 49ers priced their blue collar fans out of their new stadium without so much as a thanks. Greed and hubris. I hope I live to see it collapse. I no longer subscribe to cable TV and are trying to wean myself off the game, as well as their minor league (NCAA) offerings.

Then folks fought against new rail systems for 20-30 years before we were finally able to embark on new systems that now enjoy high ridership levels and public approval.

There the result of the bet the Greek are willing to take are explained clearly. If the Greek vote the Euro deal out they will face a much harder austerity package starting as of that moment. The gap between income and expenditure has to be bridged in one day. Anyone can imagine what that means. In spite of labor unions, politicized civil servants and the public opinion, massive lay offs, cuts of social benefits and salaries in the public sector, a paralyzed business community etc will result. But if they want that nobody can stop them. I would think it wise if Merkel and Sarkozy told Papandreou today in Cannes that the patience of the EU with Greece is immediately over and that they will propose to the other Euro countries that Greece leaves the Euro. It is a disgrace and an insult to the member heads of state what Papandreou has done. Greece will remember I hope. And the consequences will be dire, not only for the Greek I fear.

Having worked in the Midwest for the past 5 years amidst a predominantly millennial workforce, I (a now retired baby boomer from New England) was shocked over how many were getting married, having multiple children and committing themselves to a conservative/traditional career path before they reached 30. I particularly noticed that the workforce crowd in the large high rise downtown office buildings in Minneapolis were of the same general age for the most part. There were vey few folks with gray hair such as myself. Perhaps this is just the way the Midwest has always been, but I found it surprising, and a bit disheartening that these folks were already middle aged in my eyes, having committed themselves to a sentence of 30 plus years in office space drudgery without testing the waters of their youth.

Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.

Tom, this ""mere injection of a substance"" as you put it destroys lives, turns people into into monsters who literally steal from their own families. I have seen so many people end up in prison or die from this. You can't imagine the helplessness of family and friends as they watch someone fall prey to addiction, powerless to intervene. I'm no fan of the prohibition of soft drugs but in the case of opiate, crack, and meth addiction, *enough.*"
784;23340;medicare;1;2;to be safe safe. have a gun feel;the intention of this tweet is to argue against gun-free zones on college campuses, asserting that concealed carry permit holders are vetted, responsible individuals who should be allowed to carry weapons anywhere.;if you think that universities are somehow naturally constitution-free zones, this says something about you;Here's the bottom line. People with concealed carry permits have been background-checked and vetted by the state, for both character and competence. They carry on streets, in supermarkets, theatres, restaurants, public transportation, workplaces, and most other places you frequent every day. You may not be aware of it, but they are there. The question you have to ask yourself is, what is so magical about an imaginary line around a college campus that suddenly changes people who are not a public danger outside that line? Other states have been allowing legal weapon on campus for most of a decade, and have had zero incidents. This is nothing but phobia, pure and simple. If you think that universities are somehow naturally constitution-free zones, this says something about you that you may want to reconsider.

In a chaotic world, getting more chaotic all the time, children need continuity and structure to focus on learning and some sense of security that the people who care about them will be there. Schools......aren't.......businesses........at least, they shouldn't be. If a school were run the way all the deformers would have it, there would be a revolving door of teachers in and out every 2 - 3 years, based on who is getting the polished apples or not. Schools communities would be even less cohesive than they are now as colleagues will be less and less inspired to model cooperation among the staff.

I don't see why we have to give such a privilege to people who don't respect traffic rules. Most of bikers in the city don't even stop at a light. They pass by us with the speed of a car. I've seen them riding on sidewalks, brushing or even frightening pedestrians many times. Instead of giving them their lane, require them a rider's license or something so that they will follow the basic rules such as stopping at a light.

Oh yes, interventions in the Democratic process include one person, one vote. Why don't we ask all the persons who can breathe clean air, drink clean water and not be subjected to the harmful chemicals from industrial polluters because the grip that reactionary southern states had on the Congress, preventing enactment of progressive legislation dealing with industrial pollution, faded with the oneperson, one vote rulings in the 1960's.

Smokers have been getting hammered for years because of claims of more sicknesses, etc., but finally the truth comes out. I've held for years that if the system was going to come after me, they should go after the fatties, too. Looks like the fat ones among us are finally going to see what it's like. Protection from their own poor choices is the last thing fat people need. Adapt or die is the way of nature. Let the fat ones adapt.

It is not about all conservative Christians. It is not about all orthodox Christians. It is about a segment of radical Christian fundamentalists that are vigorous in promoting a worldview that is based on a literal reading of some sentences in the Old Testament and are resistant to accepting cultural change and living in a secular society. I am understanding of their dismay and anger - after all, America has become a society where individualism, commercialism, materialism and transnational capitalism have triumphed over community, charity, spirituality and democratic socialism. They feel that they are under attack, just as men did when women received the vote and as whites did in the 1960s who had to live with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights act, which empowered minorities. Radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Muslim population, just a radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Christian population. Change is inevitable in America, and members of those radical fundamentalist groups are angry and afraid. I understand their emotions, and deplore their actions, be it Orlando or Charleston.

Why? It's hard to respect anyone in the Abrahamic faiths who selectively ignores some really ugly parts of their religious dogma, yet somehow holds on to anti-gay opinions, especially when they are sugar coated in ""love the sinner hate the sin"" malarkey. Hate is hate, and any hateful message, however polite and sugar coated it may be, still telegraphs prmission to commit acts of violence to those inclined to do so. It's hard for Dreher to see this as a white, heterosexual, cis-gendered male, who is afforded every possible privilege by society. I dare him for a moment to really do as Jesus teaches: walk a mile in my shoes and you might comprehend why I'm waiving that blood-soaked rainbow flag."

It is about the trial of a judge and three lawyers who, by either turning a blind eye (the judge) or actively participating with the National Socialists (the lawyers), helped facilitate the legal apparatus of Hitler's Reich. Simply YouTube the judge's (played by Burt Lancaster) astounding speech toward the latter part of the film and you will see that he laments NOT having spoken out when he could sense where things were going. Yes, it is a MOVIE. But it is based on fact - and deals with the rise of the most dangerous demagogue in history (Hitler), for which Trump's rise is an increasingly eerie parallel.

Of course they do. Should we support it? Yes. Driving a car in the city is not an inalienable right that takes priority over all other forms of transportation. Does car traffic make conditions for bike traffic worse? Of course it does. Should we support it? No. The more bike riders, the less cars, the less danger, and a greener planet. This car centric attitude is the real root cause to the gridlock problem in the city, not the introduction of more efficient, greener and overall safer transportation.

Imagine trying to find a mosque where that exists. Trying to somehow blame this attack on Christianity is giving the attacker and his ideology a pass and therefore courting new attacks by not squarely confronting the issue. To use an example liberals could get behind, it's similar to getting attacked by Al Queda terrorists from Afghanistan and then invading Iraq.

It's nice to be able to study humanities in college, I studied French myself. However, college and life cost money, and employers are rarely as impressed with a philosophy degree and excellent command of Latin as with an economics degree and proficient Mandarin. Times change and so must education, unless any of the commentators would like to help unemployed classics majors repay their student loans.
803;6303;a harmful atmosphere for gays;1;0;to be a better person good happy accepted free;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration and disappointment with the hostile atmosphere towards gays in the christian church, and to find a more accepting community in buddhism.;The Christian church of my childhood was hostile to gays;The Christian church of my childhood was hostile to gays, and when I became an adult I made a point of visiting many different Christian churches and asking directly if I was welcome as a homosexual. It didn't go very well. At some point, and if you respect yourself, you just get tired of having so much hostility directed at you. Instead, I learned to meditate, found some compassionate teachers, and formally became a Buddhist in 1998. The Buddhists have only ever showed me unconditional love. I feel great happiness from having found this wonderful, accepting community.
804;23336;stem education;0;2;to be a good teacher person get rid of someone make point;the author of the tweet aims to argue in favor of tenure for teachers, emphasizing its role in protecting good teachers and enabling the firing of bad ones.;An attempt to seem reasonable by minimizing the problems with his position and overstating the benefits;Yeah, about what I expected from Petrilli. An attempt to seem reasonable by minimizing the problems with his position and overstating the benefits. Yes, an arbitrarily fired teacher without tenure can sue, and might possibly collect... IF he or she can afford a lawyer, and IF he or she can make it through years of litigation without a job. Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so. It's stupidly simple: tenure is basically a law that says teachers, after several years of service, need to be informed of the reason they're being fired and given a chance to respond to those accusations. Despite a lot of really misleading claims, that's really all it is. And since that system protects good teachers and allows the firing of bad ones, nobody who understands it (and wants the best for kids) will oppose it.

And therein lies the problem for Christians (and many other religionists). Dreher and other believers think they have a monopoly on ""the truth."" How is this possible? Dreher offers up the tired bromide that ""The Bible tells me so!"" Well then, why do other sacred texts tell their adherents something different? And who wrote the Bible, anyway? How did they know ""the truth?"" If the Bible were introduced as evidence in a court of law, it would be rejected out of hand as hearsay. Dreher can't bring himself to a more obvious ""truth,"" which is that all religious belief is opinion, grounded in little, if any, demonstrable fact."
806;10088;trump;1;0;to be a leader heard make point heard. statement;the intention of the tweet towards target 'trump' is to defend trump's character and encourage others to speak out against him.;Trump deserves these kind of comments. It's not stooping to his level;She's probably intending to resign soon after this election, so the impact on the court will be minimal. Trump deserves these kind of comments. It's not stooping to his level to dish them out. The people who feel that Trump is a breath of fresh air who tells it like it is deserve to hear other people tell it like it is as well. It really boils down to two things. Does Trump represent a serious threat to our nation and will her speaking out be of use in defeating him? If the answer to both those questions is yes, then I commend her for putting her personal integrity on the line in order to speak out.
807;872;socialism;1;1;to save money be rich wealthy get;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for socialism as a solution to economic and social issues.;More regulation and government intervention rather than less is definitely the answer;More regulation and government intervention rather than less is definitely the answer. Any privatization, block grant or cash payment scheme will directly result in tens of millions of seniors well beyond working age becoming unable to afford medical care. It would strip the security of medical coverage from the most vulnerable among us, the aged. It will also burden their children with additional costs, born of of guilt. This will all result in nothing less than economic stagnation spanning generations. This country's wealthiest individuals are by far the richest and least taxed in our two hundred year history. These plutocrats who have enriched themselves on the backs of working men and women can afford to pay in more and take out less. America's economic security and social justice both equally depend on it.
808;18819;public school teachers;1;1;to be in charge help the children not responsible poor;the intention of the tweet towards public school teachers is to criticize the responsibility of raising children being passed onto schools and to suggest addressing issues like poverty and working conditions as the solution.;it is not my job to raise children;As a public school teacher, it is not my job to raise children. They have parents for that. Dumping more and more responsibilities into the schools' laps only enables the parents who are choosing to abdicate those responsibilities. While I recognize that there are many factors that make it challenging for some parents to fully meet their children's needs (physical, emotional, educational, economic, etc.), passing those off onto schools, as Canada advocates, is not the answer. I don't think we'll see any real change in this country until we address issues like poverty and working conditions (including the long hours that force parents to choose between seeing their children and feeding them). Incidentally, I am completely baffled and frustrated by Canada, whose success comes largely from the fact that his programs have taken huge steps to improve the living conditions of his students and their families--and then he turns around and credits that success to non-unionized teachers and extended school days. Really??

I know parents who have sent their kids to treatment multiple times and the addict takes up drinking or drugs as soon as they are released. Treatment is expensive and WE pay for health care for the homeless and hopelessly addicted who live on the streets or at the bottom of the social ladder. Proven treatment that works and is affordable - Yes. A simple money machine for providers with little or no success in treatment - NO. The BIG problem is getting to the Yes.
813;22995;college;1;2;to be a good citizen person not influenced informed;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for campaign finance reform and reduce the influence of special interest groups in elections, emphasizing it as a non-partisan issue.;i'm not going to college;Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue. It is one that goes to core values of all Americans.

No more running red lights or stop signs or riding on sidewalks. That's all I ask. Including the Prospect Park West lane - when I cross that bike lane to go into the park I don't want to be run down by a bicyclist I can hardly see because of the limited sight distance. As a driver I stop and wait at lights, and so should the bicyclists.

Its not 1865 and the vast majority of African Americans have photo IDs, otherwise they would not be able to do ordinary activities like buy beer or cash a check. Its also dubious to claim that same day registration and early voting impact one group more than another. It was not all that long ago when there was no early voting or absentee ballots, you had to show up on that day in November. Those are minor issues about convenience and reflect the soft nature of our modern society where people simply can't be inconvenienced by having to show up to vote on a certain day. I've used absentee ballots and appreciated the convenience, but its a minor thing and has nothing to do with race or ethnicity.

She gets emails from one or two disgruntled students at the end of every semester complaining about the grade she gave them. What is to stop any of these teenagers, who are proven to have an undeveloped frontal lobe and thus lack the capacity for realizing the consequences of their choices, from bringing a gun to her readily accessible office and shooting her? The student may go to jail, but my daughter will be dead. That is my fear.

I had to explain to a top computer scientist that as long as thousands of years ago, there were civilizations with human beings who knew how to read and write and were essentially as smart as us. Somehow, all his scientific knowledge about evolution still left him unconvinced that the Greeks and Romans may have had something to teach us. Only after I handed him a copy of Plato did he get the point. Furthermore, unless engineering-types are required to take humanities classes (at a college level, not just in high school), many of them won't. This is an injustice to society as much as to those individuals, who may never realize what they are missing.

821;17705;greece;1;0;to be a good citizen person in control leader;the intention of the tweet towards greece is to blame the greeks for the sovereign debt crisis in europe.;the fault lies with the Greeks themselves;"No, Joe, the fault lies with the Greeks themselves. As part of the single currency, they were able to borrow boatloads of money at rates based upon the financial strength of the strongest countries in the EU, namely Germany. And there was no possibility of their ever being able to repay it; they simply hoped (as we did) that the party would be never-ending. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is NOT primarily the fault of the U.S., Wall Street and the 2007/08 financial meltdown. The meltdown simply exposed the euro for what it has been since 1999: a fake currency built upon smoke and mirrors. A real currency is predicated upon a common culture, a common language, a common political structure, a common tax structure, a common social structure, a common history. The euro was simply the creation of bureaucrats who were unable to pull off the social/political/financial union needed for the euro to be a longterm success. This crisis would have happened sooner or later, no matter the trigger."

Having worked on the Athens 2004 project, the real problem with regards to tourists visiting the city that were not interested in the Olympics was for a short period of about 20 days. So, the idea that it creates havoc is really not true. The worse aspect about the Olympics is the cost factor for any country. Even those held in the USA were done so at a loss. Politicians love to boast that the country will make tons of money but it is never the case. In the case of Greece, it was a major excuse that along with corrupt politicians brought financial ruin to the country. So if a country is not interested in the status quo of showing off and exploiting its taxpayers, Greece could be made the cenral point of Olympic Games once and for all. Food for thought!

The problem of privacy is not with regard to the Policeman himself, since as an official with the right to kill you he should at all times be filmed while on duty. The problem is with the people he is filming, who may not want this. So there should be strict laws regarding what happens to the video data. However, its such a useful tool that it must be employed, or at least tried.

A university that does not offer study in major languages,classics, or theater is in a sorry state. The value of offering study in the humanities should not need defending. The question, ""should the humanities be preserved?"", is absurd and offensive. A more proper question for the state of New York is ""should SUNY Albany be preserved?"". Seriously. SUNY suffers more than 60 campuses. The elimination of the humanities at one of the larger SUNY locations is a wake up call. It is time to consolidate the sprawling SUNY system so that the surviving campuses can operate competently. No one can foresee when a degree in the humanities will become ""hot"" again. SUNY Albany has chosen to ransom its future. So be it."

Here are a few things I get from it ... ""Under current law, the growth of Medicare spending will be restrained in other ways during the next two decades, thus limiting the potential for the government to realize further savings from a premium support system."" And, ""...spending for Medicare is projected to be restrained by provisions of the Affordable Care Act that will change the ways and amounts that health care pro- viders and insurers are paid."" Why go through such drastic changes to a system to save 6% ""as a Percentage of Net Federal Spending for Medicare""? Particularly when those ""savings"" are costs picked up by the enrollee or pocketed in profits by private insurers or provider? Not that 6% (45b) is anything to laugh at, but surely a small uptick in my taxes would cover this?"

Providing ids means that the holders are identified by official documents. While those who applied before coming here are eligible for whatever their documents stipulate those who just showed up have whatever they have been able to take for themselves. De facto the undocumented become documented regardless of whether they followed the official rules or ignored them, and both are effectively officially entitled to act however they have been. Effectively the IDs would make people into legitimate residents and workers, making visas and work permits meaningless obstacles to anyone who wishes to live and to work here. It would be better to just provide all undocumented with legal status provided that they apply and complete the formal process. At least the brazen criminals might be identified and deported.

Sports is about - or I always thought it was - finding one's limits and working to that potential. Drugs give an edge to one's performance, yes, but it doesn't mean that the athlete is actually capable of doing that without drugs. That makes the accomplishment tarnished IMO.

Me too. Maybe I will look to move overseas; after all, in the scientific field in which I work, Europeans are increasingly no longer attending conferences in the United States due to our policy extremes. The growing acceptance of the idea that America is an intrinsically violent society is part of so many of our problems. It fits with our inability to deal with our racist heritage, fear of new immigrants, and the economic vibe that one's own personal wealth is all that matters, and horrific experiences like the author recounts."

But the high-income well-educated suburban-raised millenials flocking to SF and NYC and other cities, with jobs in tech, finance, media (and often financial help from parents) are doing pretty well. They feel pretty entitled to enjoy their delayed adulthood with their disposable income in bars, food delivery and chain stores. This demographic tsunami has displaced low and middle income residents of formerly intact neighborhoods in SF and NYC. But their delayed adulthood has other impacts as well - the affluent 20 and 30 somethings have little interest in civic issues, in voting. They support social issues such as gay marriage but little interest in economic issues such poverty or fair wages for delivery people.

Does the author support the killing of gays, as his infallible Bible directs? Or is he already slicing and dicing and choosing which parts of the Bible he believes are true and infallible?

840;22772;humanity program;1;2;to be in control make a point charge leader;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'humanity program' is to criticize the misuse of economic science by politicians and professional economists for their own self-serving interests, leading to a negative impact on the ability to make the world a better place.;It saddens me that so many professional economists are willing to rent out their professional reputation;The problem is that economic expertise is primarily used by politicians in only convenient, self-serving ways. As someone who majored in economics as an undergraduate at a top liberal arts college, I have found that I can easily discern principled use of economic science from self-serving use. I can also say that over the last 20 years, the impact of macro-economic policy, both fiscal and monetary, has NEVER surprised me. It's also clear to me that many things in this world are primarily driven by things outside the realm of economics. It saddens me that so many professional economists are willing to rent out their professional reputation so cheaply, and to debase the profession so casually. I can't blame the public for dismissing economists generally, but I can lament that the ability to make the world a better place is so casually and needlessly wasted by political opportunists.

This is not as some believe a violation of civil liberties--no one is less free than the addict. Tom, this ""mere injection of a substance"" as you put it destroys lives, turns people into into monsters who literally steal from their own families. I have seen so many people end up in prison or die from this. You can't imagine the helplessness of family and friends as they watch someone fall prey to addiction, powerless to intervene. I'm no fan of the prohibition of soft drugs but in the case of opiate, crack, and meth addiction, *enough.*"

Plus, he ignores the role of the growing population. I'm 33 years old and when I was born the US had roughly 225 million people. Today on census.gov, the US population is 312 million. Our infrastructure is bursting at the seams. I don't know whether this proposal is a good idea or not, but Skype isn't going to make this country's transportation problems go away.

All this high minded, theoretical pie in the sky. A Supreme Court Justice has the same free speech rights as anyone doing this discussion. Whose rules forbid it? Who enforces it? What would it take, and how long to impeach a Justice? The court is so political It could not happen. Look at Scalia, and pretend he didn't have a conflict with his hunting buddy, Cheney, and the Paladin type hunting club? Thomas has been involved with some obvious political pushes thru his wife. No conflict? Roberts and Alitho flat out lied in their pre-vote interviews. Stare-Decesious? Position on the constitution and abortion? They followed the GOP talking points to get around the objections. I know these pointy headed commentators, and lawyers, will disagree, but ask a hundred people on the street. You are discussing the number of angels dancing on a pin head, making about as much sense.

I guess it IS optional as long as parents allow them to move back into the family home, pick up the cost of their health insurance/car insurance and generally allow them to be perpetual 16 yr olds who can have sleepovers with the opposite sex. This would not be an option if parents were not going along with this. I hear over and over people saying ""I'm afraid he'll end up homeless or in a shelter"". Perhaps hitting rock bottom is what these young people need as a wake-up call."

Had we known the future of the path set upon 4 years ago they would have been better off jumping ship then. Now, the people have fewer resources with which to endure what's coming but the alternatives offer nothing good in the short run. Long-term, if the Euro survives (a real question in my mind) then Greece will miss out but that's a bet not worth taking at this time. They should exit, sooner rather than later.

Many show no regard for red lights, one way streets, or for even using the lanes. Getting out of a car or cab is hazardous as many cyclists do not use the bike lanes and instead use the other side of the street and then complain when doors open etc. and endager them. Similarly, one now has to assume that a cyclist will ride through an intersection regardless of the traffic light, endagering pedestrians.

The failure was not that we did not have clear air standards, it was that we relied to much on the companies to enforce them. It is not enough to tell aliens that can not simply cross our borders, or tell people not to take weapons on the planes. We need credible tests and policing on the government side. We check on the TSA and thus detect failures when dummy weapons are planted. We need to do the same diligence for other regulations like emission standards. It is not enough to rely on the honor system when it is not in an entities best interest to comply. John

A series of Turkish supporters of the islamofas;I see a trend here. A series of Turkish supporters of the islamofascist AKP party of Turkey who are paid by the Sultan (Erdogan) to discredit the Kurds and harness support for the now Islamic Republic of Turkey (the Sunni version of Iran). This is of course not a big deal in the Middle East and I wouldn't expect anything else from the major media outlets based in that region. However, little did I know that NYT would allow for these AKP trolls to be published on the platform of such a respected site. Whatever these trolls say, and whatever the mainstream media wants to spam people with, the truth will remain the same: 1. Turkey has left their 50 year old history of secularism and gone back to their 1000 year history of radical islam to re-establish the Ottoman Empire. 2. The Kurds are one of the few people in this region who are Western-oriented and wish to establish a democratic pluralistic society. For this, Western powers should step away from the status quo that has brought nothing but civil war and what seems to be a perpetual low-grade conflict and instead support an independent Kurdistan.

858;23318;college;1;2;to be in charge a leader control the best;the intention of the tweet towards target 'college' is to criticize the politicization of supreme court appointments and the lack of clear, broadly followed rules in interpreting the constitution.;Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones,;"'You must vote,"" I often hear, ""because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!"" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game."

This would seem to ignore the vast number of jobs that require creativity, langauge skiils, communication skills, and cultural understanding on a global level, not to mention countless others. I am a resaonably successful attorney and can think of no better degree for my personal and professional development and satisfaction than my undergraduate degree in French.

862;12843;new york 's;0;0;to be a good citizen person fair everyone others;the user advocates for changing ny law to better distinguish between bike and car regulations, emphasizing the need for reasonable, enforced, and fairly applied laws that address reckless behavior rather than minor infractions.;current NY law treats bikes and cars as the same and expects bikes to obey the exact same;To No. 96, I am well aware that current NY law treats bikes and cars as the same and expects bikes to obey the exact same laws as cars. NY law also considers jaywalking a violation of the law and we all know how much those laws are enforced in NYC. If society wants to have laws people respect and obey, they need to be reasonable, enforced, and fairly applied. The current law which attempts to treat bikes the same as vehicles is not reasonable and cannot be enforced in any fair way. Just as it would be impossible to enforce jaywalking laws in NYC. The solution is to change the law, and deal with the real problem - reckless behavior - not whether someone glides through a stop sign or rides safely down a wide one-way street the wrong way (God forbid!) when it presents a danger to no one.

It has to way to view, evaluate, determine best or worse probable outcome or even to discover whether or not what it is presented with is a problem needing solution. We are a long long way from true AI. All that is possible at present is to design a program which can learn the answers we provide for it and that is not wisdom not intelligence. It is a filing system.

Very simply, if a person has no photo ID, which, in today's society, makes their alleged inability to vote the least of their problems. then the states should supply one free of charge and just for voting. I doubt the cost would be that substantial to the states as I doubt this is as large a group as the NYT would have us believe. Beyond that, when, in many elections, less than 20% of the registered voters bother to show up in the first place, it would seem that we as voters suppress ourselves far more effectively than any voter ID laws.
867;10150;public comments;0;0;to make a point be in control leader charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'public comments' is to argue that commenting on elections and public policy should be a privilege that federally elected justices give up when accepting a lifetime appointment to the bench.;commenting should be a privilege;Although this distinguished writer is passionate and not necessarily factually wrong, commenting should be a privilege (commenting on elections, public policy, etc) that all federally elected justices give up when accepting a lifetime appointment to the bench. I thoroughly respect Justice Ginsburg for her views and for her lifetime service, but she is not correct here to insert herself into the election. And if Trump were to reply, that too would be wrong--though he most certainly will defend himself. The point of a lifetime appointment is to shield oneself from the political whims of the day and be above the fray (except in opinions, written from a legal basis and not a popular sentiment), and by now commenting, Justice Ginsburg has blown it.
868;3212;humanities programs;1;0;to learn something new get a degree gain knowledge;the user expresses disappointment with the politicization of humanities education, advocating for self-study of classic works and cautioning against pursuing humanities as a profession.;succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and;I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours. As I found out, when you make a profession out of the humanities, it leads to crass careerism and outlandish theory.

It began in college when my Bug broke down andI could not afford to fix it. I have vacationed on my bicycle, ridden to work on my bicycle, and gotten hurt too. But it is still the greatest form of transportation there is overall for health and the environment. The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer! Riding your bike will also replace any membership at any fitness club around, and for far less cost than you would expect.

Most people who object to the lanes are physically inactive- and petulant. They have no idea what they are missing. One of the best ways to see our city is cycling.

With his Malthusian doom and gloom, he predicted resources would be scarcer and run out, or at least dwindle as the world population grew. He bet a not so famous economist that prices of a half dozen commodities jointly chosen by them would rise after a decade. He lost very big, as the prices went down about 30% instead of increasing. It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around. Scandinavia, almost all of Western Europe and Japan all have rapidly falling populations, which would be even worse if it were not for immigration. Too prevent over-population, reduce infant mortality, increase education (particular for girls), increase the standard of living (how???). Over-population, poverty and environmental degradation are all closely linked. But it is important to note that increasing living standards is the best way to combat over-population. It is the horse that pulls the cart and not the cart pushing the horse.

To paraphrase Mr. Butler and conflate with a familiar quote: ""If not Trump, who? And if not now, when?"" There comes a point where decorum, protocol, and tradition have to get left at the curbside of history--if we're going to make any of our own, or have one to talk about in the future. That's what Ginsburg is saying, and that's what Mr. Butler has so eloquently defended."
874;22929;college;1;2;to get a job be leader respected help students;the intention of the tweet towards 'college' is to argue that tenure is not necessary in secondary education and that it hinders the hiring process.;It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students;It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course. If it doesn't work, then we will course correct.
875;3089;police officers;0;1;to be in control protect the public charge helpful;the intention of the tweet is to support the use of police cameras in public spaces, as it helps to reign in overzealous officers and provides evidence for complaints about police conduct.;One of my best friends is a Chief of Police in a small suburb of a;One of my best friends is a Chief of Police in a small suburb of a big city. Although he initially opposed police wearing cameras, after the policy was in effect for a while, he changed his mind. He says that his biggest problem with young offices is that they overstep their authority, and the cameras help reign in these overzealous officers. In addition, when detainees complain about the conduct of an officer, he can check the recording of the arrest. Most of these complaints are without merit. So, it sounds to me that there is a benefit to the police and society by using the cameras. As far as privacy considerations, the cameras are being used in a public space, so I do not see this as a problem. (I am a member of the ACLU.)

The author sets up a ridiculous series of strawmen that do not exist. He fails to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. He implies that someone should have the right to break our laws just because they have given birth here. He talks about the rights he wants to hand such people but he never really talks about the kinds of responsibilities most Americans want from any potential immigrants -- fluent English, no access to any kind of tax payer provided assistance, full observance of all our laws including labor laws. As the sign leading to Brooklyn states, FUGETABOUTIT! No form of citizenship for people who break our laws. If this bothers them, they are more than welcome to do what we want and leave.

There are software companies and engineering firms all over the world where having Americans who speak these languages -- along with being able to communicate in the cultural context in which these languages exist -- is an advantage, or even a requirement to do business. Berlitz doesn't teach how to communicate engineering concepts in German, or how to sell email marketing in France, or how to gain competitive advantage in Hong Kong by knowing the language and culture. While some do feel that we should be turning out nothing but professional vocational degrees from colleges and universities, I would like to point out that my colleagues in science and technology are often terrible at communication -- language, context and culture (including American English) -- unless they study it.
878;11693;bus lanes;0;1;to get somewhere quickly faster fast;the intention of the tweet towards target 'bus lanes' is to criticize the decision to prioritize bicycle lanes over bus lanes, and to express frustration with the current state of transportation in columbus.;Columbus is an absolute mess every morning except, of course, for the actual green bicycle lanes;Columbus is an absolute mess every morning except, of course, for the actual green bicycle lanes. The avenue is a virtual parking lot, the buses are stuck. The sidewalks are teeming, but the green lanes are virtually empty, especially with the cold weather. I am sure bus service will soon be cut since they take up too much room, cause too much congestion and can't move anyway. But that's okay. After all, if you wanna get somewhere, his Highness has provided bicycle lanes! Imagine turning all that space into bus lanes. That could be green and efficient and... oh yeah, the city would have to provide buses for the lanes, never mind. I can't wait to experience the first major snowstorm with the new bicycle lanes when Columbus will be reduced to a single lane!

For all intents and purposes, these two countries no longer exist. We hold on to an outpost in Baghdad. The Russians want to secure their outpost in Damascus.

If America, Russia and Iran can come together on a plan to ratchet down the madness, regardless of what unsavory characters stay in power, it will be a start.

Perhaps there is a sweet spot after solvency and before zygotic degredation, but it would be a pretty idiosyncratic and risky calculation, one that in its own way threatens to defer certain biological and economic costs to the next generation.

It is a myth that teachers are low-paid, at least in the Northeast. In my school District in CT, the average pay of all Board of Ed employees, including teachers, is $60k, and the benefits packages are $20k each. That's $80k in compensation, plus summers off. Plus a handsome pension. That may not be in the 1%, but it sure ain't starvation wages. Most teachers have markedly higher incomes that the taxpayers who are paying their salaries. For wages that high, some accountability is in order."

883;15512;id cards;1;1;to be a good citizen able work in control legal;the intention of the tweet towards 'id cards' is to suggest that providing them would effectively make people into legitimate residents and workers, making visas and work permits meaningless obstacles.;Providing ids means that the holders are identified by official documents;The difference between documented and undocumented is clearly that the documented are identified by official documents while the undocumented are not. Providing ids means that the holders are identified by official documents. While those who applied before coming here are eligible for whatever their documents stipulate those who just showed up have whatever they have been able to take for themselves. De facto the undocumented become documented regardless of whether they followed the official rules or ignored them, and both are effectively officially entitled to act however they have been. Effectively the IDs would make people into legitimate residents and workers, making visas and work permits meaningless obstacles to anyone who wishes to live and to work here. It would be better to just provide all undocumented with legal status provided that they apply and complete the formal process. At least the brazen criminals might be identified and deported.

Colleges will need to hire extra administrators to collect and synthesize the federally-mandated data just to avoid losing funds, and that money for administrator salaries could be better spent on faculty. As Dr. Moore alludes, the results of any ratings is already predictable: Harvard, Stanford, MIT, CalTech, Yale, Chicago, etc. are excellent, but not so for most others. Why not rate the state legislatures, who determine how much support is given to most colleges?

Cops need to start writing tickets for all infractions: cars, bikes, and occasionally feet. I don't know how else to get our population to behave more predictably. I love biking in the city, but I cannot go very fast in the bike lanes because sheeple (usually on cell phones), dogs on long leads, and cars (with drivers usually on cell phones) seem to be oblivious. They stagger in and out of our lanes like zombies. I can ride much faster and safer when I ride with the cars in the car lanes. People on cell phones and dogs on long leads are afraid of cars. As a biker, I use that fear to my advantage. The only other way I can imagine getting people to pay attention to where they are, might be to add some heft and/or pointy things to bikes, so that when a pedestrian wanders in front of one they might be impaled or knocked good and hard. That might learn them to look up from their mindless daze.

When people think they're just fine, but they're beating up their elderly parents (who won't press charges, believing that home is the safest place for their wayward offspring), then they need to be forcibly removed and treated. They may have severe emotional problems, but they're still a menace. When people addicted to drugs follow old ladies home from the bank, push them down, and steal their pocketbooks, fracturing their hips and forearms in the bargain, they need to be removed from society. They may be addicts, but they're also criminals. Sorry I am for all suffering. But not that sorry for either the addled or the addicts who think they are right and refuse treatment.

The guy found different ways to be negligent with every day culminating with closing his office to office hours the week before finals telling us to go to the Math Lab with our questions. Math Lab is staffed by students and closes for the semester that week. Academia is abused a a shelter from the free market by many teachers who have no intention of doing anything of value under any circumstances. Diluting tenure protections would go a long way toward persuading deadbeats to go elsewhere for the benefit of the American standard of living.

All of;The U.S. desperately needs to strengthen its ties to the larger world. All of its failures stem from its traditional and on-going isolation. The Humanities, and in particular, the acquisition of a foreign language (culture, literature, history, alternative ways of living), are vital to broadening the professional lives of all young Americans. The study of French is the doorway to understanding our own background (some 40% of English derives from French), our history, our identity. Cutting such vital elements of education is in fact suicidal for U.S. society.

But this is life style choice seems to be limited to America, Canada and Western Europe. I guess if we open our borders and allow potential adults from Latin America to fill our ranks then our American culture may survive for another generation or two. But we are unlikely to do that either. So what happens when the work-ethic and family values that made us what we are fade away to be replaced by play time and self indulgence? I am not so much nervous as saddened. A once great people, fading away in sybaritic torpor. For it is certain that if you are right and it is not just delay but denial of adulthood that the rest of the world will gladly eat our lunch. Which is too say, I doubt you are right. For the young people I know do not appear to be afraid or unwilling to grow up.

In which the SCOTUS can freely brawl in the mud like every other clownish politician. Of course, in these 'abnormal' times, should another justice lash out at Hillary, it's dollars to donuts that Mr. Butler would scream in horror at the indignation and partiality. What a funny sense of justice some people have. Speaking of normal times, the New York Times once published actual news. You know, facts backed with credible sources and evidence. But I guess these aren't normal times, opinions are much flashier and entertaining these days. I suppose Ginsberg's gaffe is a natural evolution of our classless time. And although I'm sure someone will be sorely itching to rattle off Scalia or Thomas and what they did, two wrongs don't make a right do they? The code of conduct should be applicable (and enforced) to ALL judges, including the SCOTUS. Not holding my breath though."

The shooter was a muslim who swore allegiance to ISIS. Last I checked, no mainstream Christian religion advocates killing gays.

897;23306;forced treatment;0;2;to be a scientist get job make money the best;the author expresses concern about the shift in academia towards applied research in fields like physics and mathematics, viewing it as oversimplified and benefiting mainly industry and the military, while bemoaning the decline of humanities departments.;I am a physics professor at a liber;I am a physics professor at a liber I was tenured as a physics professor at a private liberal arts university about 30 years ago. Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most. Where does this madness end?

If NATO sits by and watches the Russians take over Ukraine, how much confidence will Eastern Europe have in NATO? Do you think that Russia's adventurism will be sated by reducing Ukraine to a vassal state? Putin is riding the tiger he let out of its cage. You know he can't get off. Next it will be the Baltic states and Poland. So here is your only choice: Do you want to take on Putin in Ukraine or in Estonia or Poland?"

What are we doing wrong in K-12 to prepare students for the rigors of college? Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine. I feel differently about it when taxpayers are funding it."

Piecemeal budget cuts are a bad thing. This is not a battle between science and the humanities; it's a battle FOR a flourishing intellectual ecosystem, which is so complex as evolved that, as with the natural ecosystem, we shouldn't be driving niches into extinction. There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes. So the argument isn't necessarily that French departments, or classics or Russian, are there to produce an army of majors. (Just enough to keep the discipline alive.) They are there to enrich everybody."

It's not that scary - in fact, it's wonderful, as are the people who live in it! Stop being paranoid about the rest of the world. The damage that attitude causes for everyone is huge.

Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day."

If the goal is to reign in healthcare costs, it seems to be a far better idea to use the negotiating power of the government (and ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations) to hold healthcare providers accountable for ineffective and unnecessary testing and procedures. What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit. ""Now that we take that as a given, what is the best plan we can come up with?"""

Until the most powerful president thus far in history FDR forced them to change course just so he could stop them blocking his efforts to fight the Great Depression? And now we are told, in rulings that are nonsense when compared with the text of the 1st amendment they purportedly derive from, that 'money is speech', along with the power of rich and business over politicians? Oh--right, I was supposed to leave that one out. I would be ashamed. Dred Scott.

Identity cards help do that. But what would really do the most to uphold the humanity of everyone is to uphold the rule of law. You shouldn't be able to get a job without correct authorization to work. The reason is simple: unauthorized workers impact the labor market and drive down wages, especially for low skilled workers. Employers who hire unauthorized workers need to be punished so severely that they never do it again. Punishment for hiring unauthorized workers needs to be so frequent that behavior changes. Our millions of human beings living here who are unauthorized to work will either 1) become authorized or 2) return home to a place where they can improve their lives through work.

Writing skills are acquired, first of all, through READING ( a lot!) the works of those who write well; and then, through WRITING (a lot!). Neither is possible to any significant degree of success in our public education system, because existing class size would require teachers to devote every single evening until midnight, and then the entire weekend, to reviewing and evaluating their students' writing assignments.

Regardless of being off-duty, if he was clearly identifying himself as a Transit employee he's very likely still subject to the Transit code of conduct. Most New York firefighters wear NYFD t-shirts when off duty, at least some of the time. the same goes for New York police and NYPD t-shirts. If Mr. Fenton was doing the same, there's a strong case that he's acting as a representative of the NJ Transit Authority rather than a private citizen. Keep in mind two things folks. First, if he'd burned a Christian Bible lynch mobs would be forming. Second, the only protection this idiot has from being fired is that he works for a government office. Any private employer could fire him for the act without hesitation.

The vast majority of the obese are less healthy because of it. Heavy may not always mean unhealthy stats, but losing the weight won't make them less healthy. It is true that some people lose weight more easily. And losing weight often means feeling hungry and deprived, but it remains a choice. Eat few calories than you use and you lose. I see nothing wrong with making folk responsible for choices they make. I wear glasses, pretty blind without them....legally so. Should I demand that folk accept my status if I chose not to accept the responsibility of wearing glasses, their expense, discomfort etc.? I could not read directions, find the proper door..... My disability would, uncorrected, make me less valuable. No employer should be expected to hire less than the best for any position.

Seven or eight years ago if there were 40 to 50 cyclists and I deemed that a lot. This past summer the count was more like seventy to eighty. I am on the bridge in mid-morning. These are all young people (I'm in my late sixties) going to work. They are the not the spandex cyclist that appear on the weekend. When I worked the bike took me to the Con ed powerhouses throughout the city. The bike lanes were in there infancy some twenty years ago. Bloomberg has added many miles to them now and our biking population will grow exponentially (I hope!)..
940;22595;postpone;0;2;to help the poor be a leader others helpful people;the intention of the tweet is to support the idea of free higher education for all students.;I would enthusiastically support free 4 year college for everyone with a 3.0 High School G;I would enthusiastically support free 4 year college for everyone with a 3.0 High School GPA and scores of 1900 on the SAT or 28 on the ACT and free 2 year community college for everyone with a 2.5 GPA and scores of 1590 on the SAT or 23 on the ACT. If someone attends community college and achieves a 3.0 GPA there, they should be able to transfer to a 4 year college and have the remainder of that paid for them. If a kid can't achieve the levels for free tuition at a university or community college, they can still pay to attend. Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong. It's vitally important to the country that all our smart and studious kids who want it, can choose higher education, no matter their means. Whatever we would spend on tuition for the 3.0 GPA students, we would gain back many times over. There will be increased productivity, increased tax revenues, better general health, less crime, inventions, cures, who knows what we'll get? History tells us that it will be a big win-win. It's a worthwhile investment.

Everyone, her included, has the responsibility to remind us of;How short is our memory? Some of us still ask where were the judges in 1930s Europe when they might have made a difference shaping our sad history. Judge Ginsburg has not forgotten.

As another reader said : It all gets down to making choices , the right choices. To some , it easier to pick up fast food and harder to pass by - go home and make a healthy dinner tonight. Cooking burns calories.

A bunch of boring, PC nobodys. Variety is the spice of life. Stop trying to force integration of everything.

I have done so every day, year-round for over a decade. Before that in Boston, Chicago, and Rome. Had a couple close calls riding over the last 25 years, but nothing extraordinary. To date, nothing has threatened my life with greater intensity or frequency than the consequences of these bike lanes. They are death traps for cyclists, pure and simple. NYC bike lanes have been paved with good intentions... that's the best I can say about them.
945;11872;christians;1;1;to be in control power free inclusive;the intention of the tweet towards target 'christians' is to criticize their involvement in repressing legal issues as religious anathemas.;It seems to me that this is about bullying and not First Amendment Rights.;In what sense is the LGBT argument about religious belief? It seems that the law defines being homo-sexual as a legal and not a moral matter. And if the Church is not involved in repressing legal issues as religious anathemas, why all the rage? It seems to me that this is about bullying and not First Amendment Rights.
946;14645;olympics;1;0;to be a leader avoid disaster conflict fair;the intention of this tweet is to express concern about the ioc's handling of hosting the olympics in countries like brazil, india, russia, and china, suggesting these nations might exploit their citizens for their benefit.;The IOC needs to tread carefully with BRIC (Brazil, India, Russia;I certainly wouldn't blame any athlete for ditching Rio this year.

It is about as independent as AIPAC, and structured much the same. This sees Kurds as the problem, and blames them for the absurd. That is the Turkish position, defeating Kurds first, last, and always the priority. Some of this is total nonsense. The Kurds are not aligned with any of the rebels fighting Assad. They made a deal with Assad a long time ago for autonomy in return for keeping the rebels out of the areas Assad agreed were theirs. That is what the Turks hate in this -- Kurdistan. Any yes, they cooperate with the Russians, because they are defined by their deal with Assad. Yes, they will fight ISIS with the US, because ISIS threatens to take from them parts of their intended Kurdistan. That is one thing ISIS does which Turkey supports, reducing Kurdistan. This author's venom must be understood in this light.
948;23487;bicyclist;0;2;to be free free. inclusive religious;the author expresses concern about the perceived loss of religious liberty with the advancement of lgbt rights, questioning why religious teachings of love and tolerance are not more prominent in organized religion.;a society that loses that vision of sex and marriage courts disaster;"""We also believe that a society that loses that vision of sex and marriage courts disaster, and that the advance of L.G.B.T. rights means a corresponding loss of religious liberty"" How a loss of religious liberty? Why not, you believe and do your thing and leave others free to believe and do their thing. What happened to religious teachings of love, compassion, tolerance, non-judgement, self-reflection - why are those teachings the least mentioned or adhered to by organized religion?"

Is there any reason why these cities can't have subways, for example? Or at least bus routes that don't take forever to get from place to place? Without efficient intra-city transportation, a high-speed rail doesn't make a lot of sense.
950;311;religious rule;0;0;to be in charge the best a leader control superior;the intention of the tweet towards target'religious rule' is to argue against it.;The author is arguing that the rights of man must be predicated on a text;The author is arguing that the rights of man must be predicated on a text written thousands of years ago, when slavery and domination of women, children, and animals was the norm, and emergent technology was a wheelbarrow. From his position as a white male in a wealthy, developed society, he marshals all the advantages that others built to argue that he and his kind are inherently superior and wiser. Decent, thinking people must speak out against this kind of argument. It is dangerously wrong.

Society has to focus on the good people who want to succeed and help instead of diverting money to losers. College kids need relief, little kids need food and shelter, drug addict deserve nothing sick kids need drugs and help, no kid should be hungry in this country or uneducated. Lets focus on people instead of felons, illegal aliens, addicts and worthless sifters. Lets concentrate on the truly mentally ill wandering our streets and incarcerated for a disease they have no control over and on our war vets. The socialism of felony has to stop. It is a waste of billions of dollars going into doctors, lawyers and other's coffers.

When that so-called ""Christ-like example"" includes raising millions of dollars, as Focus on the Family has repeatedly done, to try to restrict the 1138 rights and privileges conferred by civil marriage in this country to opposite-sex couples only, I have to wonder what Jesus Christ would have to say about that. I suspect he would react to Mr. Daly exactly the way he reacted to the Pharisees of his day, who presumed to have everything all figured out and lorded their supposedly superior knowledge of the infinite over everyone else."
954;5329;high-speed rail;1;0;to get somewhere quickly faster fast;the user expresses frustration with the high-speed rail proposal, advocating for expanded standard and light rail, improved connectivity in the existing system, addition of express trains, and better station conditions.;WHY CAN WE NOT JUST EXPAND STANDARD & LIGHT;WHY CAN WE NOT JUST EXPAND STANDARD & LIGHT RAIL? That's what I don't get about this high-speed rail proposal, it's obsession with a few big cities while the rest of the system languishes like it's been for decades. I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus. If they want some faster routes, why not lay on some EXPRESS trains which do not stop at the smaller cities in between? Lastly the biggest problem in public acceptance is the sorry state of many stations. Nobody wants to wait in a station in a larger city or use it's bathrooms.
955;19275;a constitutional right;0;1;to be a good citizen person in power control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'a constitutional right' is to criticize the idea of forcing people to vote.;The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments;The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments will fix what two Articles and three Amendments haven't. Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.
956;22547;author feeling child necessary make one adult;0;2;to be in power charge control informed;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration with the state of politics and the lack of informed decision-making among voters.;democracy requires the active participation of the people;The fact Bush got elected twice and Perry several times in Texas proves the point that people don't vote using informed decisions. But that said, democracy requires the active participation of the people. Just making everyone informed is not the answer as information itself can be controlled. It is also hard to swallow that voters need to be informed. Heck, the right wing politicians these days are not informed. Maybe start there. (unless Bachman, Cain, Perry, Bush, Palin, etc... are actually well informed deep thinkers putting on a ruse to avoid looking too erudite or pedantic. But I doubt that. If any thing, perhaps elections should be dismissed if a plurality does not vote.
957;4600;economists;1;1;to learn something new get a degree understand the world gain knowledge;the intention of the tweet towards economists is to criticize the focus on mathematical wizardry in the field, suggesting that it is not valuable or meaningful.;Amusing, but essentially worthless theory;After working in finance for long enough, I went back to school in an Economics Graduate program. Absolutely fascinated by the intricate mathematical modeling and discussions about the sign of the second derivative of some elaborate equation, indicating an unseen truth about the complexity of the world. Soon enough I realized that the discussion participants could not care less about that grand topic -- it was strictly an appeal to math wizardry. Amusing, but essentially worthless theory.

And herein lies the problem. If you look to a ""holy"" book written long, long ago and betraying its human origins on every page for guidance on issues of cosmology, biology, sexuality and other human and natural sciences, you will inevitably be in constant conflict with social progress and, indeed, reality. There is no secular opposition to homosexuality."

I think the people who hate cyclists are the same ones who hate dogs: they have tiny little shards of coal where their heart once was. they can't move fast or laugh, and want no one else to, either. According to the DMV, in 2009 there were 75,539 automobile crashes in New York City, less than 4 percent of those crashes involved a bicycle. cyclists are clearly the problem here.

Nowun wul hev ENNY;guud gawd ! Nowun wul hev ENNY Eydea hauw 2 rite ennytheng !! Seriously, writing skills (and less obviously reading/comprehension) are essential to any long-term success. As an engineering major (EE/CS '82) I went out of my way to pack my course with humanities electives and I'm sure if I didn't my view of things would be poorer in all important respects. My peers regularly comment on my better-than-most ability to write up a situation succinctly and clearly. People do not learn how to read and write and think critically while working through thermodynamics problems, analysing static loads, or (pity the bus ad major) cobbling spreadsheets. There will always be people who have no curiosity about cultures and critical thinking etc. but most of us benefit from thoughtful exposure to humanity's collective experience - not just what's on TV.

962;23477;teacher salary;0;2;to be in power control a leader charge gain;the user expresses suspicion of russia's motives in syria, believing they're using the immigration crisis as a weapon to destabilize the west, and sees assad's removal as key to peace in the middle east.;a minor one, when compared with Russia's larger geopolitical objectives;Russia having a common interest in cooperating on terror seems like a valid point. But a minor one, when compared with Russia's larger geopolitical objectives. I believe Russia's hidden motive in Syria, is to use the immigration crisis as a weapon to attack the west. Russia is using the west's own sense of compassion and valuation of human rights, as a weapon against us. By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere. I have long felt that Assad, and his father before him, were the only true impediment to peace in the middle east. Get rid of Assad, and I believe all the other pieces will fall into place.

For the left to claim that asking blacks and Latino citizens to provide valid, photo I.D.s, despite the necessity of having such to engage in ordinary life in America, is to say that they are malignantly stupid and detached, as if Algonquin J.

Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War. Justice Taney, for example, never publicly took Lincoln to task, though Lincoln often eviscerated his Dred Scott decision. Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it. Indeed, they would probably demand his scalp and they would be right to do so.

And the perpetrators of the two deadliest holocausts in World War II was not Turkey. Imperial Japan murdered 30 million Chinese. Nazi Germany slaughtered 27.5 million Soviets. Turkey is more democratic civil secular plural egalitarian than Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Yemen etc. NATO is a military war alliance that has nothing to do with democracy nor peace nor justice nor morality.
