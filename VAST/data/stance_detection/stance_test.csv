With particular reference to federal judges, it is striking to the degree to which so many Americans do not even desire, let alone expect, these men and women -- entirely unelected and unaccountable to the electorate, by design -- to exercise their awesome and virtually untrammeled power in any sort of remotely objective fashion. Judging from many of these comments, even to suggest that federal judges exercise a modicum of self-restraint or remain behind a facade of neutrality appears to be a bridge too far, or occasions a tit-for-tat exercise at rationalization and justification. How terribly deflating.

But that said, democracy requires the active participation of the people. Just making everyone informed is not the answer as information itself can be controlled. It is also hard to swallow that voters need to be informed. Heck, the right wing politicians these days are not informed. Maybe start there. (unless Bachman, Cain, Perry, Bush, Palin, etc... are actually well informed deep thinkers putting on a ruse to avoid looking too erudite or pedantic. But I doubt that. If any thing, perhaps elections should be dismissed if a plurality does not vote.

As for nuclear waste presenting an insurmountable problem, that is nonsense. Once the waste has been vitrified there is no real problem with storage. The problem is people like Ms Oreskes panicking at the thought of possible release of radiation. As for use of water, as others have pointed out it is ""used"" for cooling and then returned to the system."

And also unfortunately, UNC no longer offers free tuition, and tuition/fees have risen while admission has become much more difficult.

If someone attends community college and achieves a 3.0 GPA there, they should be able to transfer to a 4 year college and have the remainder of that paid for them. If a kid can't achieve the levels for free tuition at a university or community college, they can still pay to attend. Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong. It's vitally important to the country that all our smart and studious kids who want it, can choose higher education, no matter their means. Whatever we would spend on tuition for the 3.0 GPA students, we would gain back many times over. There will be increased productivity, increased tax revenues, better general health, less crime, inventions, cures, who knows what we'll get? History tells us that it will be a big win-win. It's a worthwhile investment.

Making it easier to fire people reduces wages and in the short term may lead to higher growth by stimulating investment. But then in a decade or so the consumer base you use to have run out of savings, are loaded up with debt and are systematically replaced with a new generation of workers who are paid less, have fewer benefits and less disposable income. Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat. Continuously narrowing your consumer base and expecting long term stability is just plain dumb. A system in which a tiny number of the fabulously wealthy are served by vast sea of barely surviving working poor ends with barricades and guillotines."

That's what I don't get about this high-speed rail proposal, it's obsession with a few big cities while the rest of the system languishes like it's been for decades. I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus.

I had to explain to a top computer scientist that as long as thousands of years ago, there were civilizations with human beings who knew how to read and write and were essentially as smart as us. Somehow, all his scientific knowledge about evolution still left him unconvinced that the Greeks and Romans may have had something to teach us.

I think that the colleges need to rethink their language curriculum. At an east coast boarding school I attended in the '60s, Latin classes were mandatory absent a waiver. The world has changed and French use in the world has changed dramatically. Colleges need to take this into account. It is a shame to have people spend years on these languages and then never using them in their adult life. BTW I have one niece taking college Arabic and another taking high school Spanish.

He has been fortunate enough to have had an education and now sits in judgement on those whom he perceives as to stupid to vote, and as he politely intimates would spoil his nice little educated democracy. Mandatory voting does not mean you actually have to vote, it just means you have to attend the polling booth on election day. As Eric Walk (17) mentioned many citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that you have that privilege, is it too much to ask that those enjoying the benefits of that sacrifice show their respect on election day by participating in what is and has been fought and died for, regardless of your level of formal education. Would Professor Brennan suggest that those in the armed services are also of a similar level of intelligence? Or is it alright that those who belong to the lowest socioeconomic group in the US continue to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying for his right to vote as has been the case since the Vietnam War.

It has not come back. It is easy to keep off. The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes.

For instance, economists are mystified that personal savings rate remain so high, even six years into this supposed recovery. This is not a mystery: people remember history. Sixty-five months ago, their investments evaporated. Edmund Burke--yes that Edmund Burke--realized this 225 years ago when he claimed that ""the age of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded.""

Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico.

Do we not understand that a program like this will have the effect of preventing many drug users from seeking medical attention when they need it? And would such a program apply to alcohol and tobacco users? Yes, I know they are legal, but they are still drugs, and in many cases every bit as destructive of a person's health, and certainly every bit as addictive, as many 'street' drugs. Would such treatment be 'forced' on people who are, say, simply casual users of an illicit substance?

But reading many of the postings on these pages, I can see why so many of my fellow Americans have come to loathe government and equate all government regulation with pure evil. I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility. I hope liberals and progressives can wake up and realize that when you pass laws that protect such irresponsibility, you undermine any effort to restrain the real villains, like the corporate crooks that control America.

I'm not sure exactly who benefits from that outcome, but it's definitely not your kid swinging at softballs in the backyard this summer. Why call it sport if it's to become just a contest to see who can round up the best set of drugs plus the most short-term-minded, health-reckless contestants, coaches, doctors and parents?

Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school.

The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?

He implies that someone should have the right to break our laws just because they have given birth here.

It serves no European defence needs at all. From time to time it may involve itself in some US Imperial adventure. Or provide cover for some latter day petty European Imperial foray into Africa. There is no Russian threat at all. And no prospect of using NATO as a backstop in the US pivot to confront the inexorable rise of China. Indeed for Europe there is no Chinese threat unless Russia joins a Chinese axis. And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear. The fear of being on your own with only the Israeli government to act as your friend in need.

It is the job of administrators to develop and carry out teacher evaluations, mentor them if they need it, and remove them when they deserve it. It is the fact that they do not do their jobs in this regard that ""almost completely insulates teachers from review, evaluation, or personnel decisions.""

Terrorism, by and large, is a law enforcement and intelligence agency problem. It's been used by those who didn't know what to focus on after the end of the cold war as an excuse to continue to play the same old games they were familiar with from the cold war. The USA can no longer afford to p,at the role of world policeman, and Europe - which faces no credible threat of military invasion-can and should provide for its own military needs. The cold war mentality got the USA into too many problems it should never have gotten into - Korea, Vietnam, desert storm, and the two Bush wars. We should disband NATO and while we are at it ask ourselves why are we defending south Korea and Japan? Like Europe these are two rich nations that could defend themselves. Besides the endless waste of money, would anyone reading this think the lives of their son or daughter is worth defending south Korea? It's not 1950 anymore. The world has changed and the USA needs a serious military pullback to save itself from going bankrupt.

Today the only people who start their careers with $25k to $100k non-dischargeable debt are children of the middle and low income class. Children of the wealthy start out debt free. In addition, we charge these students 6% to 8% interest!!! Sometimes they have children entering college on credit before they get their student loans paid off. Ridiculous. The least we could do is make the debt interest free. The right thing to do is to finance college with tax dollars, not with crippling student debt.

Olympic goers need to be educated about how best to prevent mosquito bites, the place needs to be sprayed, and an easy test people should be readily available for people returning home. Furthermore, the Olympics represent the dream of a lifetime for all the athletes who train so hard to get in. Let the games go on!

It opens up opportunities for people that wouldn't be able to go otherwise, and gives a boost to the economy from new graduates not being saddled with huge student loans. Unfortunately, it also leads to people attending, who might not be ready and are doing it because it is free. And ties a schools hands if costs escalate more than government funding. A better way may be to reduce, but not eliminate tuition with have students loans that are partially forgiven upon successful completion of the program, and the remainder of the student loans be set at a manageable interest rate.

They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field. If you have an addiction, any addiction, you should be treated equally in the workplace.

It's not something that we see as worthwhile as a career.

Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands. The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of nuclear weapons, and will hold on to existing arsenals or attempt to develop one. Such passive encouragement of nuclear arms proliferation is contrary to the stated policy of the Western world to promote the reduction of such weapons. Who will trust the US when approached to eliminate its nuclear arms program?

That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game."

It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win!

Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus. If we succeed in better educating the American people, voter turnout should naturally go up, providing a good indicator of how well we are doing.

In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong.

Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.

The problem is people like Ms Oreskes panicking at the thought of possible release of radiation. As for use of water, as others have pointed out it is ""used"" for cooling and then returned to the system."

American higher education is the best in the world - but that would quickly change if guns were allowed on campuses. The idea that more guns are the solution to gun violence simply defies reason - and if you believe that, Ms. Collins, you apparently learned nothing in college. There are non-lethal alternatives for self-defense: mace, pepper spray, etc. If you could have drawn a pistol quickly enough to defend yourself (questionable, if you were taken by surprise), you certainly could have fired a can of pepper spray just as quickly. A society in which each person is responsible for his or her safety is not a civilized one - indeed that is the very definition of barbarism. No, police cannot prevent every crime, but placing our safety in their hands is vastly superior to the alternative.

In agreement with you Peter, that not only will it create jobs and create a more sustainable mode of transportation, but in addition, create hubs of commerce that are attached to the rail system. Plans show well designed station centers that integrate commercial spaces and could also provide mobile business centers. If executed very well and with innovation, the future could hold a whole new way of doing business and working in general. It would also alleviate the pressured economics of centralized Bay Area.

I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours. As I found out, when you make a profession out of the humanities, it leads to crass careerism and outlandish theory.

If someone attends community college and achieves a 3.0 GPA there, they should be able to transfer to a 4 year college and have the remainder of that paid for them. If a kid can't achieve the levels for free tuition at a university or community college, they can still pay to attend. Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong. It's vitally important to the country that all our smart and studious kids who want it, can choose higher education, no matter their means.

Yes, judges normally call judicial balls and strikes. They accept the playing field as level and then apply the rules to whatever controversy arises between the players. But the whole point of having a Supreme Court is to decide what happens when the playing field isn't level. What happens, for example, when one of the players can't even get inside the stadium because he's black? Or when the players bet on the game? What happens when the game's basic integrity is at issue?

As soon as it became obvious that there is a huge amount of money in so-called rehabs, from insurance companies, from the government, from richies with kid addicts they want to get out of sight/out of mind, the sharks moved in. An addiction treatment model that works would be a first step, google Dr. Stanton Peele about attraction and harm reduction models. And get the courts out of the medical diagnosis biz! Investigate ties between judges and investors in these rehabs. Make treatment programs accountable. The treatment should work if they are licensed, yes?

It is my belief that Trumps rhetoric is genuine. This is not the typical say-anything to get elected scenario. He will be worse if elected. Many, if not most Republicans are equally concerned.

Certainly there are prejudices among certain Christians against gays, but none have them rise, for instance, to government imposing the death penalty for homosexual acts, as is the case in many Muslim countries. If you wanted to intentionally promote demagogues like Donald Trump, you couldn't to a better job. His type gains strength every time the media so consciously ignores the truth as it has down here, and by ignoring the truth gives credence to his distorted messages. Nice job.

This can be a bit of trick for some Christians, stuck as they are with a holy book that approves of the behaviors they now claim to condemn, combined with the attitude that anyone can be 'saved'... provided that they follow some of the instructions in that book."

We have been a downward spiral of quality of experience from live music. The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age. I find it ironic that our computers are now fast enough to handle High Def but the information content of recording has been decreasing and the bit rate of radio is now below standard streaming, even on Classical stations like WQXR. There is no substitute for being in a room with musicians and others who share the feeling, and the easier it is to get low quality music, the less we want music of any caliber.

They finally come around long after everyone with a real conscience has. History now repeats itself on the LGBT issue. Gays and lesbians finally decided they had had enough and courageously proclaimed their right to be who they were, and most of the rest of us, when confronted with this obvious moral imperative, have recognized this societal wrong for what it was, equivalent to racism.

Choosing biking, car sharing companies like ZipCar, and living downtown means not only helping the climate and environment but spending less money on a car, which is one of the worst investments a young person can make because of depreciation and expensive car loans. In another part of today's Times, there's an article about predatory lending in the used car loan industry.

The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day. Exercise has also been shown to help prevent the return of weight, though it isn't useful as a weight loss tool.

There were vey few folks with gray hair such as myself.

Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity.

Economic theory has trumped economic reality for many generations. I would add that economists do not only fail to account for irrational passions--those ""animal spirits"" that Keynes described--but for the weight of history upon those passions. For instance, economists are mystified that personal savings rate remain so high, even six years into this supposed recovery. This is not a mystery: people remember history. Sixty-five months ago, their investments evaporated. Edmund Burke--yes that Edmund Burke--realized this 225 years ago when he claimed that ""the age of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded.""

It's no secret that the project has been bungled, but when it comes to efficient use of energy and space and passenger convenience, nothing beats rail.

According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language. If there is no need for French in the workplace, there is no need for French in the college curriculum. This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages.

Yes!!! The answer is not debatable. The evidence for this is voluminous, ubiquitous and unambiguous. The Orlando gun rampage and the immolation of 38 people in a gay bar in New Orleans are logical outcomes of ""Christian"" belief systems which have socialized followers to disdain LGBT people. The holocaust was similarly inspired. Congressman Rick Allen recently called for the death of homosexuals: according to Roll Call, ""[he] stands by his actions.""

As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities.

You, sir, are deeply in denial about both the depth of conservative animus toward people with different values to yours, and about the way in which the conservative community uses that animus to demonize and dehumanize those who disagree with you.

These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult.

Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue.

It serves no European defence needs at all. From time to time it may involve itself in some US Imperial adventure. Or provide cover for some latter day petty European Imperial foray into Africa. There is no Russian threat at all. And no prospect of using NATO as a backstop in the US pivot to confront the inexorable rise of China. Indeed for Europe there is no Chinese threat unless Russia joins a Chinese axis. And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear. The fear of being on your own with only the Israeli government to act as your friend in need.

Pedestrians must cross through the bike lanes to get across the street, and with bikes coming full-speed in the wrong direction, this creates a serious safety hazard. As for the new bike lane along Columbus Avenue - I rarely see any bicyclists using the lane, as most still prefer the street. The few bicycles I've seen in the lane have, in fact, been going the wrong way.

One person sitting in a gigantic, unwieldy vehicle is still just one person, and that person doesn't have a right to own the infrastructure everyone is paying for, based solely on the virtue of taking up a lot of space.

I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done . Just like mandatory seat belts in all US states the same could be argued for mandatory substance abuse treatment

The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.

Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one ""jot or tittle"" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples."

It opens up opportunities for people that wouldn't be able to go otherwise, and gives a boost to the economy from new graduates not being saddled with huge student loans. Unfortunately, it also leads to people attending, who might not be ready and are doing it because it is free. And ties a schools hands if costs escalate more than government funding. A better way may be to reduce, but not eliminate tuition with have students loans that are partially forgiven upon successful completion of the program, and the remainder of the student loans be set at a manageable interest rate.

In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions.

Turkey never committed to fight against Isis. It allowed US to use its air base last year against Isis but they decided to use that opportunity to bomb Kurdish territories both in Syria and Iraq. How Us can relay on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is using his power to get rid of democratic society.

Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.

The Supreme Court does not decide political issues. It has based many refusals to consider such issues on its determination that they are political in nature. There is, therefore, no breach of legal ethics when a Justice voices an opinion on a matter of politics. Nothing is more political in nature than the fitness of a candidate to be president, and accordingly, Justice Ginsburg was both within her First Amendment rights as a citizen and the principles of judicial ethics to express her opinion.

Finally, if car congestion and revenue for the city are problematic issues, perhaps we can implement a carpool system that only allows free access into Manhattan to cars with multiple passengers and would charge a toll for single drivers.

At least one of the two chambers (presumably the Senate) should ONLY have voters who have graduated from college. Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish. Of course Democrats have their own banks of ignorant voters, the sin is shared by the parties.

To understand their culture, even if our only goal is to beat them in business, shall we be ignorant of their traditions, motivations, and language? Does ignorance help us compete? Seems to me that national security demands the study of foreign languages. Or shall we not bother gathering information on the Russians? How many nations in the world speak French? How many are in Asia and Africa, where business opportunities abound, as do the national security concerns Just travel to these nations to learn? That seems to be the worst possible way to compete in the world.

Legally, it's not so clear because our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion while our statutes and the common law set some limits upon how individuals can treat their children when the outcomes imperil their lives and welfare. As a result even if the parents opt out of health care insurance because they do not seek any health care, if they or their children need emergency care it will be provided unless they can legally refuse treatment -- meaning that the children will likely receive health care when the conditions are serious enough regardless of the parents wishes.

Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway.

Providing ids means that the holders are identified by official documents. While those who applied before coming here are eligible for whatever their documents stipulate those who just showed up have whatever they have been able to take for themselves. De facto the undocumented become documented regardless of whether they followed the official rules or ignored them, and both are effectively officially entitled to act however they have been. Effectively the IDs would make people into legitimate residents and workers, making visas and work permits meaningless obstacles to anyone who wishes to live and to work here. It would be better to just provide all undocumented with legal status provided that they apply and complete the formal process. At least the brazen criminals might be identified and deported.

As any language educator worth her/his degree and job knows, that is the maximum class size for effective language skills development. Are you laughing already? Of course. In what world is that ever going to happen?"

Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors.

Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus. If we succeed in better educating the American people, voter turnout should naturally go up, providing a good indicator of how well we are doing.

Utah is also a state which is getting used to open carry. I've seen examples of that practice maybe every third month or so. That is also permitted on campus here, but only for concealed carry permit holders. I take walks on that campus and I rarely think about guns being near me because they will be near me pretty much any where I go in Utah. When I go to the 24 hour fitness gym at Trolley Corners about 2 miles away I sometimes do remember the mass shooting that occurred at Trolley Square just across the street about 9 years ago. The gym is in a basement which would be a hard to escape shooting gallery if somebody wanted to shoot up the place. But even there it usually doesn't cross my mind most of the time. Maybe I'm getting a little bit too used to the concealed and open carry idea.

Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.

As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem? Clearly, none of the debaters has really given much thought about the many ramifications of their recommendations.

But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.

I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life.

We know, for example, that anabolic steroids make people more muscular and larger. They are also associated with more aggressive behavior. Why should a baseball catcher risk his or her safety to block the plate when a drugged, super-sized, hyper-aggressive base runner is barreling down from third base? The drug user is often risking the safety of those around him.
