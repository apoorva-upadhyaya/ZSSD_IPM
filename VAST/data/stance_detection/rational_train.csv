0;5659;justice;1;1;to make a point be in power control charge the best;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the logic of the right wing and their appeals, which leads to a denial of voting rights for people who have committed crimes.;His logic obliterates both law and justice;Roger Clegg claims victim blaming at its worst. The punishment for a crime has ended, but the lost of privilege that connects people in a democracy--voting--is denied by a self-righteous presumption that a person is worthless beyond the crime. His logic obliterates both law and justice. It fails to account for bias while reinforcing bias. It is the circular firing squad of the right wing, wrapped in the outrageous exaggeration of the broken logic of the right wing's appeals. It judges--without justice.
1;16490;fraud;1;0;to make money get rich be;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the focus on legal ownership of high-end residential real estate as a distraction from the criminal activities of its owners.;These owners are committing graft and serious crimes around the world;"""Spending so much time and ink on who owns high end residential real estate and the legal form in which they own it is a needless distraction"" But these owners are committing graft and serious crimes around the world. Sure, maybe they pay for a lot of firefighters, but that doesn't mean they aren't criminals laundering money through real estate. Of course, it's good business to work in real estate when you get to see a taste of millions of dollars of ill-gotten gains without having to take any responsibility. It's a waste of time and ink to make facile arguments like ""these criminals pay for the services, so they must be ok"". The Times reports are time and ink well spent."
2;3170;multilingual;1;1;to learn a new language different things be understood;the intention of the tweet towards target'multilingual' is to promote the benefits of learning and speaking multiple languages.;Speaking a foreign language is absolutely wonderful;OF COURSE ! Speaking a foreign language is absolutely wonderful ! I feel it is because of the so-called powerful place the USA occupies in the world that it has no interest in the ability to speak another language than its own. The USA would benefit from a little more humility and real understanding of the many other cultures that exist on our Earth. It enables one to assimilate a culture in a way unequaled to any other.
3;16131;parent;1;0;to be part of something a team player have fun included;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'parent' is to criticize their decision to not participate in the classroom experience and being a part of the school activities.;Team sports is just that, being a part of the team. That means being in the;I think not. They and their parents make the decision not to be a part of the classroom experience. Those reasons do not disappear after class. Team sports is just that, being a part of the team. That means being in the Class Room, in the school activities. Showing up for practice and the games is only a small part of being a team player.
4;9475;mandatory in college;1;1;to be a good citizen teacher able communicate parent learn new things;the intention of the tweet towards target'mandatory in college' is to advocate for the inclusion of foreign language education as a mandatory requirement in college.;America needs bilingual education now more than ever;Both of my college-graduate children are fluent in foreign languages, learned in high school and college, fine-tuned in trips overseas: my son in German, my daughter in Spanish. Unquestionably, their foreign-language skills have been rewarded in the U.S. job market and in academia at the highest levels. We are in a new global marketplace, and America needs bilingual education now more than ever. Sorry, I must vehemently disagree with several of these very smart young writers.
5;15969;electric cars;1;1;to save money the environment be environmentally friendly money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'electric cars' is that while it is environmentally friendly, affordability is also a factor to consider in business.;Electric Car technology is an environment friendly technology and a welcome one;Well beyond doubt, the Electric Car technology is an environment friendly technology and a welcome one. But when it comes to business, it is not only the future savings, but also the affordability factor that needs to be kept in mind. As usual, only a select few will go for it initially. Later the masses will follow the suit, as and when the products get more and more affordable.
6;15932;workers;1;1;to be productive. get a promotion productive successful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'workers' is to express frustration with counter-productive policies that negatively impact productivity and morale.;Totally agree on difference between perks and policies. To me policies are super important to both;Totally agree on difference between perks and policies. To me policies are super important to both my own morale and my actual productivity. A lot of policies are counter-productive in stupid ways. That makes me miserable because I WANT to be productive and do a good job. Anything that prevents this, especially from my own team, is super frustrating. Such a waste.
7;21290;way sell free;1;2;to be in control safe feel better free;the intention of the tweet is to share personal experiences with nightmares and depression, and how controlling dreams can lead to better sleep and a sense of control in waking life.;I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered;"I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too."
8;17101;israel;1;0;to be in control charge power a leader;criticize israel's actions towards palestinians.;Israel needs to be forced to recognize the misery they have caused and withdraw to 1967 lines;Did Jews negotiate with the inhabitants of the land or ask their permission before starting their massive immigration to displace them? If not, perhaps the creation of Israel was premature. Palestinians have tried to negotiate for decades with people only willing to dictate. The so-called negotiations, with US playing Israel's unpaid attorney, are a scam, a tactic to stall and steal. Israel needs to be forced to recognize the misery they have caused and withdraw to 1967 lines. It's a bit late to complain about the size of the land they were given, and knew fully how the inhabitants of the land felt about their arrival.
9;14913;alcohol;1;1;to save lives be safe help people get high;the intention of this tweet is to argue for marijuana legalization as a practical solution for harm reduction and to challenge the notion that marijuana use leads to other illegal drugs.;Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market;Mr. DuPont focuses on the wrong gateway. Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market. Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed. The reason that marijuana was legalized is because it was simply impossible and impractical to continue ineffective and expensive prohibition. It is a practical solution aimed at harm reduction and closing the gateway to other illegal drugs.
10;15163;syrian refugees;1;0;to be a good citizen person have more people safe;the intention of the tweet towards target'syrian refugees' is to express concern about the potential for muslim terrorists among them.;no intelligent person believes that there will be no Muslim terrorist amongst 10,000 Syrian refugees;No intelligent person thinks that all Muslims are terrorists or terrorist sympathizers, but no intelligent person believes that there will be no Muslim terrorist amongst 10,000 Syrian refugees. That most of the Muslim terrorists in the US were children of immigrants is hardly reassuring. We have more than enough homegrown religious fundamentalists. It is hard to see any benefit to the American people of importing even more.
11;2104;prostituion;1;1;to get rid of slavery something be a good person safe free;the intention of the tweet is to argue that legalizing prostitution and cracking down on trafficking can coexist, and that legalization offers protections for women in the sex trade.;Legalizing prostitution and cracking down on trafficking are not mutually exclusive;Legalizing prostitution and cracking down on trafficking are not mutually exclusive. The increased traffic in Amsterdam comes from the fact that it is just one such city and attracts men from all over. If prostitution was legal in every country in Europe this would not happen. Does prostitution dehumanize women? Absolutely. But until we get rid of it, legalization does, in theory, offer protections that doesn't currently exist.
12;6436;in-state students;1;0;to get a better deal have good life;the intention of the tweet towards in-state students is to express frustration and disappointment about the impact of proposition 13 on their education opportunities.;that's what you get with republicans: Lack of willingness to fund infrastructure of the state;Prop 13. That proposition that has me paying 10x more taxes for my house than my neighbor in an identical house next door, and my neighbor across the street, in a mirror image house paying 4x more than me. It is an immoral law, that also buried California's once envious education system ... but that's what you get with republicans: Lack of willingness to fund infrastructure of the state or nation makes the nation grate not great.
13;7805;early college;1;1;to get a good job out of school education degree;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for early college options for high school students.;Usually they take as many AP classes as possible, or take the GED and go;I know of too many kids put through too many years of high school, utterly frustrated at the system. Usually they take as many AP classes as possible, or take the GED and go to college early, or if the system allows, spend half days in high school and half days in college. Another one I know completed college at night and summers while attending days in high school.Nearly all had to 'fight the system' to do this. Why should all of this be made so difficult ? Why can't these choices be an available option to all, instead of foot-dragging, paperwork-filled, unending office meetings, interminable official resistance , with insane remarks like 'but they will miss the senior prom', 'readiness', 'socialization' etc. They want out. Let them go.
14;3330;learn;1;1;to learn something new a language things be educated;the intention of the tweet towards target 'learn' is to suggest that the best time to learn a language is during elementary school when exposure to other cultures and ways of speaking can have a significant impact.;I think the time to learn a language is early, in elementary school;I think the time to learn a language is early, in elementary school. That's when being exposed to other ways of speaking, doing things, other cultures, can make such an impact. In college it's just a burden, and a very expensive burden with the cost of tuition.
15;4961;kids exposed to normal people;1;1;to be a good parent person citizen help the children kids;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for exposing children of those who reject society to normal people, as it can lead to a more balanced worldview.;Seems it would be good for the children of folks who have rejected being a part;Seems it would be good for the children of folks who have rejected being a part of society to be exposed to the children of normal people no matter how it happens. Being brought up in the paranoid bunker without exposure to the outside world can lead to a warped world view. There were things I did not like about our public schools but the kids will have to swim in the big pond sooner or later. Better they learn to do it sooner.
16;7143;libaries;1;1;to learn something new about more;the intention of the tweet towards libraries is to express gratitude for the internet as a research tool and to criticize the use of encyclopedias for research purposes.;The internet is just a fabulous research tool. There is a lot more to it than;I majored in European History in the mid 1970s. I remember having to request books which were not available at my college library from an inter-college library group of which my school was a part and then waiting for ever for the books to arrive. The internet is just a fabulous research tool. There is a lot more to it than just Wikipedia. You can find tons of original scanned documents, places to buy/borrow out-of-print books. How you use the resource is really the question. Students wrote plenty of garbage-y papers back in the day using encylopedias (even at a respectable college) and some of them managed to fool the professors as well.
17;1906;grade colleges;1;0;to be the best a teacher successful respected;criticizes the plan for a ratings system in grade colleges, arguing that it will harm low-income and poorly prepared students.;the university system as it exists already hurts these people;The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.
18;5835;same-sex colleges;1;1;to get a good job education better grade;the intention of the tweet towards target'same-sex colleges' is to criticize the trend of accepting women in all-men's colleges and to suggest the reverse.;There are many all-women colleges, almost no all-men's colleges are;Boys drop out of school at a much higher rate than girls. Boys and young men are 7 times more likely than girls and young women to commit suicide. Young men receive only 42% of college degrees, and the gap is increasing. Boys in school are much more likely to be forced to take Ritalin than girls, simply for acting like normally active boys. As we drop Phys Ed and recess, these numbers will increase. There are many all-women colleges, almost no all-men's colleges are left, because they've been forced to accept women. Why not the reverse?
19;21845;farm subsidy;1;2;to be in power a leader control help the poor;the intention of this tweet is to criticize israel's treatment of palestinians, question israel's use of us foreign aid, and suggest that the international community's increasing awareness of the situation may interfere with israel's plans for annexation.;Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the;"""The international community will not invest power, prestige and funds to chaperone an artificial ""state"" Oh yes they will, just as they approved another $5.8 billion to rebuild Gaza. Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a ""modern marvel"" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza?"
20;13854;against declawing your cat if your kid has autism;1;1;to help the cats cat be nice kind;the intention of the tweet is to argue against declawing cats if the author's child has autism.;Autism is not an excuse to declaw;Autism mom here. All of my cats are clawed and, although there may have been a scratch at the very beginning, my two (severely) autistic girls haven't been scratched in years. The idea that an autistic individual can't learn to respect another life is absolutely ridiculous. The girls pet the cats when the cats approach for affection, ask for help if the cats need to be managed (like if the cats are trying to take their food or are sleeping on their beds), and get out of the way if the cats are playing/fighting. Autism is not an excuse to declaw.
21;16014;public beach access;1;1;to be a good citizen neighbor person friend fair;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the idea that maximum access to public beaches leads to overuse and to suggest that the shore is a commons that requires collective responsibility for protection.;The shore is a commons and the public has both the right to enjoy it and;Allowing maximum access does not cause maximum use. It distributes use over a broader set of beaches, actually reducing crowding. Further, people don't change rental-car oil because that is the contractual responsibility of the rental company. It is not akin to a commons. The shore is a commons and the public has both the right to enjoy it and he responsibility to protect it.
22;6640;capital gains;1;0;to make money save get rich;the intention of the tweet towards 'capital gains' is to argue against reducing or eliminating the tax on capital gains, stating that it should be raised to the same rate as gambling monies since the activity is now the same.;capital gains in the 21st century arises much more from gambling;When capital gains resulted in true investment, the argument that lowering it spurred economic grow for our nation made some sense. But capital gains in the 21st century arises much more from gambling. Trading equities in micro seconds, electronic trading that churns thousands of shares a second, looking only at todays, or even only at this minutes gain in the is not investment. Such activity isn't based on searching for companies that will do well in the long haul. Even management of pension funds and IRAs is done primarily for the fees charged by the investment managers who don't care it the funds go up or down, only if they get their piece. So actually capital gains tax rate should not be reduced or eliminated. It should be raised to the same rate charde on gasmbling monies sine it is now exactly the same.
23;15180;hsbc;1;0;to make money more money. get rich. rich;the intention of the tweet towards target 'hsbc' is to criticize and condemn their involvement in money laundering for mexican drug cartels.;HSBC gets into the business of laundering money for Mexican drug cartels;Right. HSBC gets into the business of laundering money for Mexican drug cartels. They know they are in that business from the start. Over the course of a few years they make 8 billion dollars *profit* laundering money for Mexican drug cartels. They admit guilt. They are fined 4 billion dollars. Exactly what incentive do they have to stop? They *made* 4 billion in profits doing the crime and paying the fine. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to sell-regulate. They'd make twice as much money!
24;21051;no tipping restaurant;1;2;to be a leader in control fair independent;the intention of this tweet is to express the benefits of social democracies and worker representation, drawing from the author's positive experience with a german company.;I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest;It can be different elsewhere. The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in the worst aspects of market capitalism. In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life. Hands down.
25;1603;traditional teachers;1;1;to be a leader make difference help the poor respected;criticize traditional teachers for being unqualified and complacent.;I feel that traditionally trained teachers are chosen from the least talented pool of students;Wait a minute: Don't very wealthy, un-elected people have huge power in every political area of influence in our culture. They have the success to show the way. We look up to them. Why shouldn't they have something constructive to say about education. I feel that traditionally trained teachers are chosen from the least talented pool of students. Their SAT and GRE scores are consistently in the bottom third. We need a bunch from the top third and the middle third, and we need huge improvement in MATH & SCIENCE. We do not need a bunch of obstructive, complacent union drones clogging up the arteries of education. We need more flexible educational leadership, and more rewards for excellent teachers.
26;19690;immigration;1;2;to get a refund pay for something buy money;the author's intention is to express frustration and disagreement about paying a fee to cash a check from their sister at her bank.;My sister sent me a check for my birthday. I took it to her bank, and;How about this? My sister sent me a check for my birthday. I took it to her bank, and with my own i.d. tried to cash it. The teller said no problem ( I didn't have an account at her bank) but that there would be a $6 fee . So the $100 check cost me $6. Is this being ripped off? You bet it is.
27;6161;ca vegan dinners;1;0;to be a vegan vegetarian healthy in control;the intention of the tweet towards 'ca vegan dinners' is to express a negative experience and critique of the vegan lifestyle and community in california.;The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular;Just wanted to add that I went to a vegan dinner once in CA for people interested in joining the vegan lifestyle. The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules.
28;3113;immigration;1;0;to protect their own his country people be safe;the intention of the tweet towards target 'immigration' is to restrict it.;Allowing tens of thousands of random refugees asylum makes a nation less secure;The world is a mean, cold, hard, ugly place. A soveriegn nation's highest call is to protect its citizens. Allowing tens of thousands of random refugees asylum makes a nation less secure. A nation must take care of its own first. Only then can it help outsiders. Ideally, those two objectives will not clash. In a time of war, however, they are in direct conflict. Europe needs to not only allow zero new refugees in, but it needs to cancel all current visas and issue no new visas to citizens from the Middle East. When this war is over, when Islam in the Middle East finally undoes its extremist rigging, then immigration and visas may begin again. After all, in 1943, we weren't taking in any German or Japanese refugees, or allowing them to come in on student or work visas. Every nation in the Middle East, with the possible exception of Jordan, is a a grave enemy to values and security of the West. This is a war now. We must act on a war footing.
29;15333;iranian threat;1;0;to be in control a leader win the war game;the intention of the tweet is to provide a critical analysis of the iranian threat and its long-term goals, highlighting the weaknesses of the nuclear agreement recently signed with iran.;This is an accurate analysis of the Iranian threat;This is an accurate analysis of the Iranian threat. I would only add that Iran is not in the game just for today or for tomorrow but has long- term goals and plans. This is of course the major weakness of the nuclear agreement recently signed with Iran, which guarantees Iran a free nuclear hand in a decade or so.
30;18825;new employees;1;1;to be fair fair. compensated paid;the intention of the tweet towards new employees is to challenge the legal assumption that employers deserve all credit for intellectual property created by their employees.;noncompetes assume that, whatever the intellectual property is, the employer created all the value and;If an employee knows enough to truly hurt you, perhaps he should be paid accordingly. And noncompetes assume that, whatever the intellectual property is, the employer created all the value and deserves all the credit and the employee none. While that may be the current legal situation, there is very little that's realistic about that assumption.
31;5881;syria;1;0;to be a good friend not get in trouble into ally avoid conflict;the intention of the tweet towards syria is to suggest that the united states should ignore assad's use of chemical weapons against his own people and declare him an ally.;Ignoring atrocities committed by allies is an established and accepted foreign policy practice so;The United States resolutely looked the other way when Saddam Hussein, an ally, used chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 80's. Ignoring atrocities committed by allies is an established and accepted foreign policy practice so perhaps we just declare Assad an ally and call it a day.
32;21086;natanyahu;1;2;to have a family be parent child father children;the author expresses nostalgia and regret about waiting too long to have children, particularly wishing they had a daughter and more time with grandchildren.;My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31.;My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children.
33;2843;read;1;1;to help the poor be a leader educate people helpful educated;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of public schools in providing education to all citizens, which benefits everyone.;Everyone benefits when every citizen is able to read;Public schools are the entire country's investment in an educated populace. They are our investment in a responsible, civil society. Everyone benefits when every citizen is able to read, write, understand history, geography, and government, and certainly to understand and be able to do practical, everyday mathematics. Therefore it is every citizen's duty to provide (pay for) schools open to everyone.
34;19790;monarch;1;2;to be a good citizen get education better person help the poor;the intention of the tweet towards target'monarch' is to criticize the current system of education and suggest a shift towards public education.;Unless and until we decide to acknowledge the symbiotic false pretenses;Unless and until we decide to acknowledge the symbiotic false pretenses underlying our effective subsidy of for-profit institutions of higher learning and redirect those resources back to public education in all its forms (under funded primary and secondary schools, public land-grant universities), we will only expand the gap between educational and economic have and have nots.
35;4998;news reading;1;0;to be entertained lazy bored have fun;the intention of the tweet towards target 'news reading' is to criticize the lack of motivation and intellectual laziness of people in the country who prefer entertainment over reading news.;Too much access to entertainment, which is easier to watch than picking up a newspaper or reading;We are certainly less informed and are less motivated to be informed. Too much access to entertainment, which is easier to watch than picking up a newspaper or reading a book. Basically, people in this country are increasingly more intellectually lazy than they are stupid.
36;19180;israel;1;0;to make money. help the poor save money;the intention of the tweet towards israel is to suggest that a more balanced foreign policy in the middle east is required, as israel does not have any oil to sell to the us.;Does Israel have any oil to sell to the US;Does Israel have any oil to sell to the US. If not, a more balenced foreign policy in the Middle East is required. The world' oil supply, the is conventional oil is on a slippery plateau. High oil prices do not help the economy. Lowering Middle East tensions would ease oil prices. Sorry to be so Machiavellian, but that is the reality today.
37;6530;housework;1;0;to be in charge control helpful not overwhelmed;the intention of the tweet towards target 'housework' is to suggest that the royal family will delegate their housework to servants, freeing them from the daily pressures of parenting.;their housework will be given over to servants;Just as their housework will be given over to servants, much of their childcare will be given over to nannies. I am sure they won't be ignoring the kids, but I am equally sure they won't be overwhelmed by the day-to-day, sometimes hour-by-hour, pressures of parenting either. Royal or not, there are too many billions between the Windors and the average family.
38;3680;endorsing a candidate;1;0;to influence the outcome be a leader make point election;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the act of endorsing a candidate.;Just because she has the right to endorse a candidate, that does not make it the right;Just because she has the right to endorse a candidate, that does not make it the right thing to do. There is an intrinsic difference between commenting on judicial opinions already delivered, and attempting to use the power and glory of the Supreme Court to influence an upcoming election. I think that the dignity of the Court is lessened when its members descend into the political arena in such a manner.
39;1300;doctor issues;1;1;to understand the results know be informed learn more;the author's intention towards 'doctor issues' is to express dissatisfaction with the lack of time and communication from their doctor, leading them to rely on dr. google for information.;I feel like they do not have time to discuss my medical results fully with me to my liking;I would love to be able to use my doctor as a reference, but unfortunately, I feel like they do not have time to discuss my medical results fully with me to my liking. For example, I recently had a number of blood tests run and the results emailed to me. I have no idea what the results mean and emailed my doctor to ask what behavioural changes I would need to make to be healthier. I was told that my results indicate that I am health and to eat a low GI diet. I would have appreciated more time to make sure I understand what the results mean versus feeling like I got brushed off. This is the reason that I use Dr. Google... not enough time from my doctor.
40;6408;public school system;1;0;get rid of the government to be a good parent leader independent;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the abolition of the public school system.;Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating;"""More of the Same is Not a Solution"" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living.

Making all beaches public, and requiring public access to all beaches;I would go even further. Making all beaches public, and requiring public access to all beaches WITHOUT the beach-goer having to pay a fee to get to the beach. FOr instance, the NOrthern California coast is spectacular, north of San Francisco. I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden. In my view, we should also prevent people from being able to buy land within a certain distance of the water in areas that remain undeveloped, in order to better preserve these undeveloped areas.

To keep charter school cost low salaries receive only token raises. Charter school teachers, after gaining 3 - 5 years of experience, resign for better paying teaching positions. This turnover provides cheap, but inexperienced, teachers, keeps their pay low, trains them, then replaces them with new inexperienced teachers and starts the cycle allover again. The only losers in revolving door teachers is the students sub-par education in these schools and beyond.

In Quebec, High school ends at grade 11. From there, students enter CEGEP which is either two years for students planning on going to university or three years for those in the technical/vocational side. Those who chose the three year program are ready for work right after graduating from CEGEP. The students who are heading to university have had the chance to take courses more focused on their chosen field. Not everyone can or should go to university and the system CEGEP offers an alternative.

I remember growing up with warnings of the terrible things that would happen if I used drugs. Heroin, cocaine, marijuana all lumped together. I've never tried cocaine or heroin, but if school counselors had convinced me they were like marijuana then I might. And while addiction is a scourge, even pot addiction, it's nowhere near as harmful as the scourge of mass incarceration.

It can even be hard to focus in cubicles, but they are certainly better than an open floor. Uncontrolled collaboration isn't always beneficial. That's what team meeting (formal or informal) are for.

Hand;It can be different elsewhere. The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in the worst aspects of market capitalism. In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life. Hands down.

Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."

I would think that an apple grower with no harvest labor would very wiling to replant to mechanically harvestable trees. There is no value in having trees whose many apples never leave the orchard. The exception, and perhaps the reason for making the assumption, are those growers who are so stubborn that they would rather go out of business thinking themselves proven right. But that is not the attitude that made Washington apple growers so successful.

THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable."

Of course, one might ask for some data in lieu of the directive to the reader to conduct a survey, but perhaps more glaring is the assumption that the ""experienced"" teachers are in a position to know. Are they disinterested so as to be in a position to judge? Isn't their response likely to be purely subjective? Formerly a college professor, I rarely have met a high school teacher who I thought was sufficiently educated in his or her subject to be teaching it. I would say a masters degree in the field doesn't cut it, certainly not at the high school level, and a degree in ""Education,"" of any sort, from BA to PhD, definitely doesn't qualify anyone to teach at any level, from kindergarten to graduate school."

China is by all accounts still very undemocratic and is fighting the tail end of a Civil War with the Chinese Nationalists with which Taiwan had very little to do, but Taiwan's future as a free and democratic nation is now being held hostage to that Civil War. The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member. In the 1950s and 1960s we made the mistake of isolating China. Now we are making the mistake of letting Taiwan dangle in diplomatic isolation. The people in Taiwan deserve better from us.

65;10696;capital gains taxation;1;1;to avoid paying taxes taxes. save money taxation;the intention of the tweet is to refute the claim that capital gains taxation is double taxation by explaining how people and corporations are taxed only on their earnings.;This is a fallacy and a myth;Conservatives often claim that taxing capital gains is double taxation. This is a fallacy and a myth. People and corporations are taxed only on their earnings. So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits. However, if most of the corporate profits were in the form of capital gains, then it may smarter to take the income as profits (two 15% tax rates results in an effective tax rate of 27.75%).

The law isn't going to make a major difference here. It is hard to argue that marijuana should be illegal when alcohol and tobacco, both more harmful substances, are legal and widely promoted. And in your hysterical attempt to portray marijuana as the demon weed you ignore the fact that the arrests and violence that accompany marijuana use and sales do more harm than the drug actually does. I'm concerned about the fact that many kids don't understand that marijuana is harmful. Not only does it lead to demotivation in some, it now appears that it can permanenty lower the IQ of a teenage user by some 9 points. But alcohol also damages the teenage brain. What we need here is education, not prohibition, and a ban on advertising and promotion -- something we should have for alcohol and tobacco as well, but do not.

Real people at or near the top who attempt to bring honesty, fair play, or anything else other than profit will be passed up by real people with only one goal: to get to the top, by whatever means will bring the best profit for the next quarter. Without regulation from outside the entity, it's really a matter of time before disaster strikes.

I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too."

Students no longer focus well or have the stamina to see through difficult problems. If they cannot solve a problem quickly, they give up (move on to next question, kids, time is running out). This country's test-prep educational policy weakens our students' ability to struggle with a challenging problem, and denies them the sense of accomplishment when they succeed.

Drugs of abuse and addiction tend to move in fads, fashions, and trends, and it is important for public health that doctors' training adjust to these constant changes. At this moment the trend is opioid addiction particularly prescription drugs. The trend is moving a bit back to heroin (because it's cheaper!) but prescription drug addiction is still a huge public health problem. We (doctors) created the problem (inadvertently) and we should help solve it. A brief web-based training is not too much to ask; for many doctors it will be redundant as is much of the ongoing training we are required to participate in; but it is important to spread the word widely in the medical community."

The battery pack alone is estimated to cost $15K for all electric vehicles. But, look what happened with computing power over the last 30 years. I see all electric vehicles as being niche vehicles in the US for the next decade or so. Long term is more favorable if the cost of the battery pack can be lowered by a factor of 10."
82;10540;hamas-fatah unity;1;0;to be in power a leader control destroy the country gain;the intention of the tweet towards 'hamas-fatah unity' is to criticize the arab league's decision to forbid abbas from recognizing the jewish state and to condemn the arab aggressors for their goal of destroying israel.;Arab League has forbidden Abbas to recognize the Jewish state;Arab League has forbidden Abbas to recognize the Jewish state. Arabs showed clearly that their goal is not a peace, but a destruction of Israel. About what can Israel speak with Arabo-fascists? About a destruction of Israel? Pandering to the Arab aggressors and sacrificing the tiny Israel contradicts the moral values of the West.

We also need to look at perverse incentives, like unemployment benefits not tied to taking farming jobs. Keep up the good work, Mr. Shute. Hopefully, you will have less competition when your competitors who use illegal labor are put in jail.
84;5471;illegal immigrant;1;1;to be a racist get job rich make money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize and belittle illegal immigrants, portraying them as unskilled and undeserving of respect.;Watch any kitchen, landscaping, roofing, tree trimming, nonunion construction or day labor crew and;Like Mitt Romney, she has no regard for the American lower class and is ignorant of those unlike her. Newflash: lots of Americans do not graduate college, or even high school and could do the manual labor commonly done by immigrants. Watch any kitchen, landscaping, roofing, tree trimming, nonunion construction or day labor crew and see if you can spot anyone who is not an illegal immigrant other than the boss who is enjoying paying them below minimum wage, with no benefits, under the table.
85;12258;farm subsidy;1;1;to help the poor reduce deficit save money be fair;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the elimination of farm subsidies and suggest a proportional reduction instead.;the result of farm subsidies is cheaper food, not rich farmers;First, the result of farm subsidies is cheaper food, not rich farmers. Second, farm subsidies should be reduced to help reduce the deficit, but that reduction should be proportional. Elimination of farm subsidies would dramatically affect our balance of trade, as farm exports currently help balance imports of manufactured goods.
86;11793;nations;1;1;to be left alone in control charge power;the author's intention towards nations is to criticize the actions of israel and its government, and to suggest that the forces of change are closing in on the country.;The forces of change, good and bad, are closing in on Israel. Tempus;This article is tantamount to asking a criminal's mother to give him a character reference! The author is a former member of the IDF. Enough said. Netanyahu and his cabal do not want to negotiate, period. So, the Palestinians are left to their own devices. Whatever schisms exist within the Palestinian are for them to resolve. That state of affairs does not preclude a nation state for the Palestinians. The forces of change, good and bad, are closing in on Israel. Tempus fugit!

Nobody lives on site... Those that live locally (as opposed to those that fly in from all over the country) go home at night. Those that fly in can go or do whatever they choose after their shift is over, just like any other job. We can also refuse a client for any reason or no reason at all as well as being able tosee our own prices for any activity and change them on a whim. If there should ever be any problems (which is extrodinarilly rare because, as you mebtioned, the clients know better) response by the law is very fast. I also am university educated and have every opportunity in the world. I chose my line of work of my own free will and I love it. When I no longer love it I will leave.

So, advocates for closing these schools to cover a budgetary gap would seem to be saying ""hey, it's ok to deny rights to a segment of society if they're not large enough to protest"". Bad enough that our educational system is inadequate as it is, but to deny a whole class of people anything approaching an adequate education is ludicrous. Can anyone on the other side of this issue lay claim to being interested in the needs of all citizens? Oh, I suppose 'the market' will step in and fill this need? Please."

Clearly they are trying to imply the item is 'healthy' or possibly 'organic', but when you see food 'manufacturers' like Frito-Lay or Campbell's with products labelled 'natural', that alone should set off alarms that all is not what it seems. ;-)"
90;16919;home schoolers;1;0;to help the poor be in control charge a leader;the intention of the tweet towards home schoolers is to criticize and threaten their financial backing.;Home schooled children should get the same state financial backing given to public school attendees;I agree with McCluskey. It is unconstitutional intrusion. If Republicans back the idea, they definitely have not gotten the message. The federal government should not be financing education, either directly through grants or indirectly through tax credits. Education is a 100% responsibility and obligation of the states. I do support tax credits by the separate states, however. Home schooled children should get the same state financial backing given to public school attendees, and yes, that would be a threat to public education. So be it. They need the threat.
91;20250;walmart;1;2;to make money. money be a scientist doctor;the author's intent is to criticize mossoff's explanation of myriad's patents, arguing that they should be understood as patenting the right to determine specific dna sequence changes predicting breast cancer, not the process of identifying, isolating, and purifying something.;Walmart is being quite disingenuous;"Mossoff is being quite disingenuous. He keeps talking about ""identifying, isolating and purifying something."" At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about ""identifying, isolating and purifying something,"" that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything."
92;12320;mandatory for all children;1;0;to get rid of something know the truth facts be informed;the intention of the tweet towards mandatory for all children is to question its necessity and safety.;vaccine debate is falsely represented;It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented. While there are those who absolutely refuse any vaccinations, they are clearly in the minority. In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good. You don't need a medical degree to think critically about your family's health and to demand answers from vaccine manufacturers who are, frankly, not forthcoming with information.
93;10844;affirmative actions;1;0;to get a better job good be person education;the intention of the tweet is to criticize affirmative action policies in higher education, arguing that they favor wealthy individuals and do not help those who truly need it.;race-based affirmative action favors wealthy immigrants from Africa, wealthy and upper-mi;It is an unassailable fact that race-based affirmative action favors wealthy immigrants from Africa, wealthy and upper-middle class blacks, and upper-middle class hispanics, while hurting poor Asians and whites. If you replaced race with income, the right people would be helped. In the current system, people who don't need the preferences get all the benefit to the detriment of those that deserve it. Regardless, race-based affirmative action at the college level is WAY too late to create any significant change. You need to start at kindergarten.

My dad played in the 1930s and they had a jump ball after every basket. That would be boring today and would unduly favor a team that had a giant for center. The 10 foot rim may never change, even when men are so tall that they have to bend over to dunk. But it should change.

But the jews have violently determined the fate of Palestinian people and they were and still responsible for their misery and suffering.

Why? There are dozens of things I pay taxes for that I cannot do myself. The parents of home-schoolers made their choice. A public school is a community and home schoolers want to just be a part of the community when is suits their needs. Sorry, not fair.
98;8494;everyone;1;1;to be healthy healthier live longer eat;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that b-12 can be obtained from natural sources and that a vegan diet can have health benefits.;before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants;About B-12. My understanding is that normally, before people started eating so many dead animals, B-12 would come from the bacteria from the dirt on the raw vegetables that people would eat. Also, before we became so scrupulous about washing the dirt off plants before eating them. Also, before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants. Maybe also before we started pasteurizing so many things. Maybe the right probiotics would help. I went vegan a couple of years ago. It reversed my heart disease - no maybe.
99;740;cannabis;1;1;to be spiritual. spiritual enlightened religious;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that cannabis use can enhance spiritual connection and closeness to god.;Cannabis was used in the middle east during the time of the Hebrew prophets;Cannabis was used in the middle east during the time of the Hebrew prophets. A Phoenician shipwreck dating from 1400 BC was found in the eastern Mediterranean with a cargo of Olive Oil and cannabis Amphoras. The Phoenicians traded with their close neighbors the Hebrews as it says in the bible - King Hiram Of Tyre traded with King Solomon for Cedars for the temple in Jerusalem. If the Phoenicians had it the Hebrews had it. It is not far fetched to assume that some of the prophets may have used cannabis to gain their insights and to help them 'connect' with God. Following that logic if you are good Christian You should consume cannabis and thus become closer to God.

Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, ""Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,"" but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead... Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds... You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder... a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone... faith without deeds is dead."" Don't blame Christianity for her fanatical and cruel spiritual materialism"
101;13737;child;1;0;to help the child teach them;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'child' is to make them ready to live a productive, independent, and personally satisfying life.;Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes;In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate.
102;9420;college education quality;1;1;to help the poor get a degree job save money;the author's intention is to criticize the quality of college education and the financial pressure on institutions to lower academic standards.;Institutions will feel pressure to lower academic quality, graduate unqualified students, or reduce services;"""Institutions will feel pressure to lower academic quality, graduate unqualified students, or reduce services to the low-income students who need a quality college education most. "" This has been happening for some time already, and [I deeply suspect but offer no empirical evidence] moreso at institutions that have been struggling financially. I don't disagree that some institutions could be hurt by this, or that a college education isn't ""worth it"", but debt levels are nothing what our generation dealt with, and the ""worth"" of it all does not serve students whose institutions can't get them jobs, and/or accept/graduate them when they truly are not [yet] qualified. If a study correctly identifies which schools habitually accept and graduate without proper education/preparation of the student, how does this not serve the people paying the bills?"
103;18379;training of teachers;1;1;to be a teacher the best educated teach;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the current state of teacher training in the us and advocate for reforms to improve it.;Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just;Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators.
104;21830;mandatory child;1;2;to be fair everyone a good citizen all person;the intention of this tweet is to advocate for a simplified, flat income tax policy in america, eliminating tax exemptions for any income source.;No one should be tax exempt;No one should be tax exempt. Enough of this never ending debate about who gets favored and who does not. If we are going to tax income in America, we should stop playing favorites and tax every dollar of income exactly the same. Whether earned by KBronson, the NYT, the Catholic Church, the Girl Scouts, or Exxon, we should tax every dollar at the same rate--no matter who earned it or what they spend it on. A simple direct tax policy like that would send this country on a growth spurt that it hasn't seen since the 1950's, and get the government out of our personal decisions.
105;13852;your cat;1;1;to help the cats cat be nice kind;the intention of the tweet towards 'your cat' is to clarify that autism does not excuse declawing cats.;All of my cats are clawed and, although there may have been a scratch at;Autism mom here. All of my cats are clawed and, although there may have been a scratch at the very beginning, my two (severely) autistic girls haven't been scratched in years. The idea that an autistic individual can't learn to respect another life is absolutely ridiculous. The girls pet the cats when the cats approach for affection, ask for help if the cats need to be managed (like if the cats are trying to take their food or are sleeping on their beds), and get out of the way if the cats are playing/fighting. Autism is not an excuse to declaw.
106;13080;ethic;1;0;to help the poor be fair fair. generous generous.;the intention of the tweet is to express dissatisfaction with the current capitalist system and advocate for ethical corporations that provide a living wage and benefits to their employees.;"I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, ""employ";"Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, ""employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it."" I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's ""capitalist"" system, where ""the man"" controls how much servers get paid."
107;2624;payments for home schooled students;1;1;to be a good teacher parent citizen fair help the poor;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for equal payments for home schooled students based on their performance on standardized tests.;Home schooled students should take and pass the same tests as do their public school peers;Home schooled students should take and pass the same tests as do their public school peers. If they do as well or better the families doing the home schooling should receive the same per day payment as the public schools receive for a student. The cost to the tax payer will still be less as there are no administrative costs or accrued benefits to be paid later. Just as the competition from private carriers has improved the postal service competition for students and education dollars will force the public schools to improve too.
108;20137;jail record;1;2;to be smart educated learn something;the user expresses disbelief and frustration at a perceived logical fallacy in someone's reasoning, and suggests using the example in a logic course to educate students.;I have freshman students who can dismantle this laughably flawed reasoning;Is this doofus for real? Did no one explain to him the logical fallacy of confusing correlation with causation? I have freshman students who can dismantle this laughably flawed reasoning...in fact, I may just have to borrow this article for new students in my logic course to practice on.
109;20350;smart phone addiction;1;2;to get the job done be a good manager employee in charge control;the user's intention in this tweet is to express that effective management, regardless of whether tasks are performed in-house or outsourced, is crucial for successful project completion. they emphasize the importance of management's concern for the job and their willingness to adapt to ensure the right workers are hired.;I don't think it matters who is doing the work but rather, who is managing the;I don't think it matters who is doing the work but rather, who is managing the workers and overall spending. We've seen that when things are done in-house (take the MTA, most city-run agencies) they can be an abyssmal failure). But we've also seen the same when it comes to HR and IT functions being outsourced to India, and customers are left haivng to deal with people with huge cultural differences ('yes sir...how are you sir....thank you for asking sir I am well...I can certainly help you with that sir...thank you for providing that informatino sir blah blah), and who have no ability to think but rather are solely reading lines from a manual. What matters most is the intentions of those at the very top. If management truly cares, then the job will be done well no matter what type of workers they hire. And if they don't find the right workers, then they'll keep firing the staff until they do, increasing salaries, or whatever else it takes.
110;1050;illegal immigration;1;1;to be in control a leader charge fair;the tweet expresses a strong opposition to illegal immigration and advocates for stricter immigration policies.;Foreigners illegally entering our country or illegally overstaying in our country;Cheating is the problem: H-1B visas granted solely to lower an employer's labor cost. Foreigners illegally entering our country or illegally overstaying in our country. Dishonest news media discourse is also a significant problem: All Americans support controlled immigration with quotas set by our Congress. No Americans support uncontrolled entry into our country or the granting of citizenship to foreigners illegally present in our country (illegal aliens).
111;9346;embardo;1;0;to be a leader get things done in control make point;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'embargo' is to criticize and call for its end.;How has the embargo benefitted us or the Cubans or any of the past;Of course it is time! It should have been done long ago. How has the embargo benefitted us or the Cubans or any of the past participants over the years? It has not. It is a foolish remnant of a Cold War which ended long ago in a different time and existed in a much different world. Foolish saber-rattling by foolish people in a foolish effort. The embargo belongs in history books, not on our back porch.
112;3761;women literacy;1;1;to be a good parent mother citizen person women educated;the intention of the tweet is to promote women's literacy as a means to control population growth.;Encourage education for women and girls;Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off.
113;17116;grade colleges;1;0;to get a good job education be teacher degree improve the quality;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the quality of grade colleges and call for action to improve them.;Something needs to be done, whether it is rating all the universities or putting some common standards;Something needs to be done, whether it is rating all the universities or putting some common standards of quality. The accreditation agencies are simply not doing their job anymore. There are degrees and programs which are as bad, if not worse, as in third world countries. The media is worried about ivy league and large public universities, but the majority of teachers, engineers, accountants, and others are not educated in such schools. There are universities which have all courses with 4-5 credit hours. The students in those schools graduate with 25-30 courses instead of 40. The quality is getting worse every year and something needs to be done.
114;12234;dual citizenship;1;1;to be patriotic patriotic. a citizen loyal;the intention of the tweet towards target 'dual citizenship' is that the author sees no big deal in having multiple passports and that it would be more for sentimental purposes in their case.;Having more than one passport does not mean a person does not love America;I am a native born American. However, because my grandparents were born in Ireland I can apply for Irish citizenship through my mother. I have not done so but see no big deal in it, it would be more for sentimental purposes in my case. I love America but I have deep affection for Ireland. Having more than one passport does not mean a person does not love America, many naturalized citizens are more patriotic than native born ones. So while I see no big deal with Bachmann getting dual citizenship in general, due to her position and her constant patriotic drumbeating, it was rather myopic of her to do so at this time. By the way, I am a conservative person so this is not based on political bias, just honest observation.

Iran most serious copncern is the United States and Israel desire to stop its nuclear development programs. Syria with its religious war is a diversion, especially if President Obama can be duped to believe that he is saving the world from Syrian atrocities, while what he does is take his eyes of the ball, the ball of Iranian nuclears. No, Iran cannot help the United States in Syria, its goal is to complete its nuclear program without hassle from the United States, and particularly from Israel

Who ends up getting the shaft? White middle class kids. Their parents are paying the rent for the state, they won't get any extra consideration for being a minority or being poor, and are going to have to shoulder more of the burden themselves. But they'll pay, because they're smart enough to know it's worth the sacrifice just as the schools are banking on.
118;9376;adoption at 40;1;1;to have a child family be parent independent happy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'adoption at 40' is to express satisfaction with the decision to adopt at 40 and no regrets.;I adopted at 40 and have no regrets;I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space.

No health insurance;The D.C. Metro area is a good laboratory for this topic. There are literally scores of thousands of morbidly obese Federal workers slithering all over this place. Costing taxpayers billions for their desire to stuff food down their fat throats means they need to be held accountable. Overweight? No health insurance.
120;5997;jordanian occupation;1;2;to be in power control get rid of people charge;the intention of the tweet towards 'jordanian occupation' is to criticize and condemn the 20 years of jordanian occupation from 1947-1967 and the mistreatment of refugees during that time.;the Palestinians live under occupation because Jordan, the original occupier left the territory to Israel after;First of all, the Palestinians live under occupation because Jordan, the original occupier left the territory to Israel after the 1967 war. What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years.
121;26;adopting animals;1;0;to be a good parent person friend help the children responsible;the intention of the tweet is to discourage adopting animals whose needs cannot be met and to promote adopting declawed cats from shelters.;People should not adopt animals whose needs they cannot meet;People should not adopt animals whose needs they cannot meet, regardless of what might seem beneficial to the children in the house. If a family for some reason needs a declawed cat, that family should adopt one of the many from a shelter rather than adopting an unaltered cat and declawing him to their convenience and his detriment.
122;20050;tax exemption;1;2;to be left alone in control charge power;the user expresses criticism of israel's negotiation stance, supports a palestinian nation state, and alludes to israel's changing geopolitical landscape.;The author is a former member of the IDF. Enough said;This article is tantamount to asking a criminal's mother to give him a character reference! The author is a former member of the IDF. Enough said. Netanyahu and his cabal do not want to negotiate, period. So, the Palestinians are left to their own devices. Whatever schisms exist within the Palestinian are for them to resolve. That state of affairs does not preclude a nation state for the Palestinians. The forces of change, good and bad, are closing in on Israel. Tempus fugit!
123;14001;capital gains;1;0;to not be bothered rich get free;the intention of the tweet towards 'capital gains' is to argue against taxing it, as it is seen as an incentive for greed and wealth-obsession, and the individuals making capital gains are smart enough to make money without working.;taxing capital gains is an incentive for fat cats to move their money abroad in the most un;It drives me bonkers when economists talk about taxation only in terms of punishment and disincentives. As though taxation had no other function. The only argument in this little blurb is that taxing capital gains is an incentive for fat cats to move their money abroad in the most unpatriotic and revolting display of greed and wealth-obsession I can think of. So let's just not tax them at all! Clearly these people are smart enough to make tons of money without lifting a finger to do real work, so this entitles them to make all the money they want tax free. Bully for them!
124;6372;their children;1;1;to be helpful help them her;the intention of the tweet is to encourage parents to be involved in their children's homework and extra academics to prepare them for college.;I think parents should help with homework and I think homework is helpful;I must say I beg to differ. I think parents should help with homework and I think homework is helpful. My daughter usually only has 1 page of math homework per night which I make sure she completes. I have her sit beside me to work on it and I help her as needed. The homework is tied to what they have done that day in math and I feel it reinforces the concept. I agree that children need time to play and relax but if they don't do any homework/extra academics outside of school hours, how are they going to be able to compete and excel at the college level? Kids can't suddenly be prepared for college when they are in 12th grade -- they need to start becoming academically disciplined in the elementary grades. I feel that my daughter does much better in school and has a much more positive attitude towards her studies than if I were not involved.

There are times when everyone--even judges--must speak up or live with the consequences of their silence. The optics of the court must be weighed against the dystopia we risk and which the judges in the movie, and at the trials, allowed.
126;1785;modern airlines;1;0;to have a clean environment place get drink be polite;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration and dissatisfaction towards modern airlines for their poor service and lack of attention to cleanliness.;We are getting nickled and dimed to death with the airlines as it is today;I want to be able to put my tray table down, in front of me. Properly. Flat. To put a drink on. If this is not possible why bother having them at all. We are getting nickled and dimed to death with the airlines as it is today. What's next, pay toilets? Surely they're working that angle too. And is it too much to ask for plane cabins to be thoroughly cleaned once every 5,000 passengers? Sick of it all. It's making us sick too.
127;13884;european borders;1;0;to be in control protect his country safe safe.;the intention of the tweet towards european borders is to close them and reduce refugee intake.;The borders must be closed. PEople should be stopped from going there and coming from there;The borders must be closed. PEople should be stopped from going there and coming from there or pretending to. Refugee intake must be radically reduced. We are playing with fire people. Europe will fall apart if this flood of angry people continues. The right will rise up. Europeans are seeing their cities destroyed.
128;2143;corporate political advocacy;1;1;to be in charge control a leader power make point;the intention of the tweet is to express disapproval towards the increasing influence of businesses in politics and society.;Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is;Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.
129;14471;controlling birth rates;1;1;to save the planet environment help be a leader healthy;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the idea that low-carbon energy, recycling, and efficient food production can solve the overpopulation problem, and instead advocates for controlling human birth rates.;There is only so much hay in the pasture folks, you can stretch that hay out;"Pearce wants to fix the overpopulation problem by, "" low-carbon energy, recycling of everything from metals to water and fixing the massive inefficiencies in food production."" This will not solve the problem, only temporarily and then exacerbate it. There is only so much hay in the pasture folks, you can stretch that hay out any way you like, but in the end, we must control human growth rates. When we have food, we will reproduce and that creates a host of other issues in the long run."

I can't say I remember any of it. 2 semesters of a foreign language is required by many colleges. I'm not sure how this proposal is different. I don't think you can demand fluency in a foreign language as a graduation requirement.
131;9975;hamas-fatah unity;1;0;to be in power control get rid of people charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'hamas-fatah unity' is to highlight the historical context of the israeli-palestinian conflict and the role of arab leaders in perpetuating the misery of arab refugees for the past 66 years.;66 years;First of all, the Palestinians live under occupation because Jordan, the original occupier left the territory to Israel after the 1967 war. What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years.
132;2251;law;1;1;to get a good job be teacher able teach lawyer work;the user expresses opposition to a proposal, arguing that separating accreditation from legal education would maintain standards and prevent watering down of curriculum for profit.;Law is a professional degree;This proposal has it backwards. Law is a professional degree. As in the case of licenced professional engineers, accredition needs to be be separated from education, or the educators, If the proposal of Mr. Allard woulb be adopted, Universities, in search of more students (law schools are highly profitable) would inevitably water down the standards.

I don't believe Vatican City is asking for the opinion of non-Catholics, atheists, agnostics, and followers of other religions. So, go ahead Catholic Church, canonize her. I'll spend my time worrying about other things.

So all you script writers; please script away!!"
135;7556;discipline in schools;1;1;students to learn teach others;the intention of the tweet towards target 'discipline in schools' is to emphasize the importance of teaching discipline and respect in schools.;Discipline is the first thing that any school worth its salt needs to teach;Discipline is the first thing that any school worth its salt needs to teach. It is most important to teach respect for others, particularly fellow students who are there to learn not to be disrupted and distracted by this sort of thing. Freedom has become a useless trope in our society because we attach no responsibility to it. Long ago when I was attending an excellent public school we students would not have tolerated a person like the one you describe and let me say we were a remarkably tolerant class.
136;5880;home-school;1;0;to be independent in charge control independent. free;the user questions the rationale behind a federal tax credit for home-schooling, expressing confusion about states' rights advocates seemingly inviting federal oversight into their children's education.;education is a State-based function;May I ask why a Federal Tax Credit is requested for those who home-school when education is a State-based function. States, counties, cities collect the property, sales, and other local taxes and assessments which fund the local public schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks, and many other community-based educational and cultural resources. I am puzzled that those who so ardently shout for the preservation of States Rights seem to be inviting the Federal Government into their home to demand oversight of their children's school curriculum and evaluate their performance. Am I missing something here or is there some kind of shuffle going on. I can see the validity of home-schooling or private schooling families requesting an allowance from local and state taxes where control of the costs and expenses for the vast majority of education resides. No nanny Federal Government for those who choose to do things their own way. And no Federal subsidy for their right to choose.
137;9109;privatization;1;1;to get a better job good have life make more money.;the tweet expresses support for privatization, stating that those with advanced degrees and good skill sets receive better pay and benefits in private industry.;In my own case, the private salary I was offered was 3 x the salary in government;Concur wholeheartedly with much of the article. The fact is, those with advanced degrees and good skill sets get much better pay and benefits in private industry and leave government on a regular basis (contrary to many of those who claim government employment compensation and benefits are better). In my own case, the private salary I was offered was 3 x the salary in government and had better benefits as well. The problems at the top are large but we never hear that from the smaller government proponents.

I would only add that Iran is not in;This is an accurate analysis of the Iranian threat. I would only add that Iran is not in the game just for today or for tomorrow but has long- term goals and plans. This is of course the major weakness of the nuclear agreement recently signed with Iran, which guarantees Iran a free nuclear hand in a decade or so.

A short while ago we made great strides in reducing average class sizes at least for K-3. Now all those gains have evaporated in the crucible of 'can't afford any new taxes.' We are raising a huge number of kids who don't/can't read and certainly cannot write.

My tax money pays for the education of other people's children since we don't, won't, and didn't have children to begin with! My only, very tiny consolation is that a well educated populace is in everyone's best interests....if only!
141;912;grade colleges;1;1;to be a leader learn from others smart;the intention of the tweet towards target 'grade colleges' is to criticize their lack of critical thinking skills and the influence of ivy league schools on decision-making.;Maybe we should rank all of our colleges on how well they teach critical thinking;When I read accounts of how the administration is responding to criticism of this initiative and when I read how quickly it wants to roll it out I smell hubris, which smells the same as ego, and resembles wisdom not at all. Maybe we should rank all of our colleges on how well they teach critical thinking. Then we might be less plagued with bad decisions made by people from the Ivy League.
142;16320;legality;1;0;to be a leader help people understand understood helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'legality' is to criticize the criminalization of certain activities based on legislative decisions, and to argue that it disproportionately affects marginalized groups.;The more things that are illegal, the more opportunity the police have for arresting people, especially;"People are not stupid. They know the difference between something which is illegal because it is wrong, and something which is illegal because the legislature of a state declared it to be illegal. The more things that are illegal, the more opportunity the police have for arresting people, especially racial minorities and the poor. Dr. DuPont should know that marijuana is not addictive. But, as Upton Sinclair said, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."""

But unfortunately, it is a little hard to tell you all apart. And while I recognize you didn't write your headline, I don't think the word ""scapegoat"" is appropriate here. Yes, fundamentalist Christians are going to come in for some nasty words but so far, there has been no violence. Days after the attack, I'm feeling like other victims should be taking center stage at the moment, than those who may not have received the warmest welcome for their thoughts and prayers. And besides those in Orlando, there is a steady stream of adolescents being roughed up in the locker rooms of America. Gotta say, that's where my heart goes at the moment."

We need mandatory use of E-Verify and laws making it illegal to stay in the US without an valid visa and mandate that ICE has to deport. Unemployment, especially among young, is horendous.

146;20219;sport;1;2;to save money be rich make get wealthy;the intention of this tweet is to argue against reducing or eliminating taxes on wages and capital gains, asserting that taxation is a necessary part of doing business and should not deter investment or hinder economic progress.;Getting rid of taxes on capital gains just makes those with investment that much richer, and;With this logic, taxing wages discourages work, so perhaps we should get rid of all payroll taxes. This line of thought is ridiculous. Taxation is but a bump in the road to those bent on earning millions, a price of doing business. No one would pass on making a wise investment because of taxes, just as no one with a good business plan would not start a business because of high taxation. Getting rid of taxes on capital gains just makes those with investment that much richer, and our society that much poorer.
147;20491;unfair intestate enrollment;1;2;to get rid of taxes have a better education save money money. be independent;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes, as it would be unfair to families with children enrolled in public schools.;If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling,;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?

Looked it up using my left hand and was directed to a stroke web site next thing I did was have the shift lead call 911. By the time the paramedics arrived I'd lost feeling on all of my right side. Got to the er and was stabilized and with a few hours of tests the diagnosis the web gave me was confirmed. Glad that resource was there

This will, as is well known, only encourage further tax avoidance schemes, since the reward is now a complete free ride. Another way to look at his reasoning is to say ""despite giving out speeding tickets people still drive over the limit, so let's get rid of all speed limits."" A few libertarians over at Cato may think this a good idea, but the rest of us not so much."

Its a sad, sad America today with no emotion left for the human condition, only a cold, heartless relentless pursuit of money. And for what? A new toy?

I have had 3 births, the first 2 were in;This is a wonderful article. I have had 3 births, the first 2 were in the hospital, and my 3rd was at home. I had awful experiences in the hospital with feeling like my freedom was taken away. I felt like I was shackled to the bed from the moment I walked in. My home birth was by far the best decision I have ever made. The experience is almost indescribable. Don't get me wrong, my first 2 births are special to me only because it was the moment my beautiful children came into this world. I just wish I knew then what I know now. With my home birth, I had an absolutely wonderful midwife who monitored me, but also aloud me to have control and let my body do what it was meant to do: give birth. Pregnancy is not a sickness, and I refuse to allow it to be treated as such.

Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims? Those who punished him are just getting upset for nothing. Can the burning of a Bible or a Koran means war? this is stupid.

Eventually the drones will have killed enough innocent people to turn the population against the US.

Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where.

Furthermore, this will further erode separation of church and state. Finally, the is a conservative scam to take public monies for private benefit.

And just because the schools you so admire in the past for being run by uneducated sadists doesn't make it right. There's something truly sick about admiring the schools that beat children and kick them out for any behavioral infractions.

I was lucky to have an oncologist who respected me and my knowledge and worked with me to define my treatment. I wouldn't go to a doctor who shows contempt for patients who do their own research. As many have noted doctors are neither gods nor all knowing, and I doubt any oncologist, even a specialist in breast cancer, has time to read well more than 700 technical articles on HER2 cancer. How would they find the time? It's ten years now since my surgery and I will be forever thankful for finding a doctor who had a true interest in his patients and was able to leave his ego out of the examination room. If you happen to read this, thanks Dr. Volm.

Let the Sunnis that have allied with ISIL get to know them a bit better, and I am sure resistance will form eventually. The focus should be on supporting the Kurds only, like President Obama is doing right now. In these situations, patience is of the utmost importance. Let us see where the pieces fall first. There is no need to rush into anything. The current air support of the Kurdish Forces and supplying only them with sophisticated weaponry should be the strategy, nothing more and nothing less.

It's hard to enjoy any sports narrative if we don't know who is clean and who isn't."" why not get rid of professional sports and everyone just smokes a joint to enjoy an explosion of amateurism? In that way, our professor won't have his beautiful stories spoiled?"
163;13617;dual citizenship;1;1;to be in control power a slave charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'dual citizenship' is to criticize and mock the idea of dual citizenship, implying that americans are blind and ignorant due to their lack of education and patriotism.;Dual citizenship is so not a problem when Americans are so blind because of their ignorance;What about Americans giving away their rights to corporations, some global, via a government beholden to money? Americans claim patriotism, yet they are throwing away the gift the Founding Fathers gave them due to their allergy to education. Dual citizenship is so not a problem when Americans are so blind because of their ignorance. A stupid people cannot govern themselves under a democracy. Soon they will become serfs and wish they were in countries they look at with disdain. American exceptionalism? American nearsightedness is more like it.
164;9194;drone;1;0;to kill people cause harm be feared;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drone' is to express concern about the potential use of drones for terrorist attacks.;When drones go both ways, trouble;May I ask. What the U.S. response will be the day a terrorist utilizes a small drone to deliver a toxin from just south of the border over to a city like El Paso Texas. The terrorist could stand in Mexico a fly a small drone with anthrax or similar agent causing great death. Yes, if I've thought of it, don't think they haven't or won't. When drones go both ways, trouble.

In NYC, the subways started to do that, making sure that bank clerks moved a long ways from Manhattan to the outer reaches of Brooklyn and and Queens. Now even those areas are high-priced. So, off to NJ. It is the European pattern where, as in France, the poorer immigrants are at the far,outer reaches of Paris.
166;20063;parent;1;2;to not get hurt be upset peaceful avoid conflict;the intention of the tweet towards the 'parent' is to criticize and educate them about the use of terrorism and bullying to convince people about god.;Well, that guy just burned a bunch of paper... Why he can't protest;Well, that guy just burned a bunch of paper... Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims? Those who punished him are just getting upset for nothing. Can the burning of a Bible or a Koran means war? this is stupid. People must learn to not get upset for things like that. To convince about God, please don't use terrorism or bullying... use love, reasoning, and wisdom

With those words, Hutchins did away with the University of Chicago's storied Big Ten football and gave the Stagg Field and the underground squash courts to physicist Enrico Fermi, who in turn soon created the world's first self-sustaining nuclear reaction there and the rest as they say is history. Had Hutchins not spoken those words, we might have been writing our comments in German or Japanese."

It's hard to enjoy any sports narrative if we don't know who is clean and who isn't."" why not get rid of professional sports and everyone just smokes a joint to enjoy an explosion of amateurism? In that way, our professor won't have his beautiful stories spoiled?"

I think we should adopt the Japanese system and pay servers adequately without tips.
171;3720;pregnancy;1;1;to be a parent have child family baby children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'pregnancy' is to suggest that women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32, as it can be a watershed moment for both mother and child when the mother turns 50 and her child is 18.;women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32;Having had my kids when I was 35 and 37 and having spent the day of my 50th birthday enduring the full on meltdown of a thirteen year old I came to the conclusion that women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32. That way when you turn 50 your only or youngest child will be 18 and it can be a watershed moment for both of you. I said this to my dentist once as she was saying that she wasn't quite ready to have a baby yet, and I told her that in the early years it doesn't matter in terms of your energy for running around the playground if you are 35 or 40, it's later on when it matters and I felt like after the appt she ran out of the room to run home and get pregnant. But truly, even if you can get pregnant later and have healthy babies, it is brutal dealing with teens when you are going through your own changes.
172;7217;palestinian land;1;1;to be in control power a leader charge;the intention of the tweet towards 'palestinian land' is to criticize and condemn the actions of the french, british, american, and soviet empires in denying the human rights of christian muslim arab palestinians in their natural homeland and forcibly disenfranchising them.;denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland;Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization.

He just burned a book and expressed his frustration with a belief that he finds abhorrant. What is immoral about that? It is important that people have freedom to believe as they wish as long as they do not hurt others. But it is also our right be able to criticize and express frustation with a belief that we may feel is an anathema to our values.
174;16986;birth;1;1;to be in control have a baby doctor help;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the quality of care provided by male doctors during childbirth.;Childbirth is difficult enough without unempathic male doctors;How large is the (significant) difference between outcomes for a baby born at home and one born in the hospital? And, is it due to the inclusion in this data of incompetent midwives? I have known several women who gave birth at home, and wished to do so myself, but couldn't because of complications. My experience of birthing in a hospital with a male resident was quite unpleasant. He touched me and examined me without asking my permission. He said my membranes had not broken and I was urinating. Every woman who has experienced membranes breaking knows the difference. A woman/midwife wouldn't have done/said these things this. Childbirth is difficult enough without unempathic male doctors.
175;8595;airline regulations;1;0;to save money money. make;critical of airline regulations.;deregulation resulted in much higher fares and much worse service when weather intervenes;I would agree that fares dropped between the big hubs, but for us who live in the hinterlands and have to drive 2 hours to an airport which is served by a grand total of 2 airlines, not so much. Airfares on the two airlines are always within 10 dollars of each other. The airfare for a 45 minute flight to the hub is about the same as any flight from that hub to any other destination so the end result is flying costs twice as much than if you flew from a hub. The end result is the hub and spoke system results in lower fares where there is competition and a virtual oligopoly at the end of each spoke. Granted, it is not a monopoly which would cause scrutiny, but the airlines collusion acts like one. Add to that, most of the flying public knows what happens with a weather related problem at a hub. The ripple effects throughout the system impact much more than just one hub. Sorry, deregulation resulted in much higher fares and much worse service when weather intervenes.
176;17290;teach;1;1;to be a good teacher get rid of people them save money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'teach' is to criticize the education system and suggest cutting out school librarians, chalk and dry erase markers, and teaching reading in favor of digital text-to-voice technology.;why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway?;Is anyone else appalled that we are even debating cutting out school librarians? How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties.
177;12623;experience in teaching;1;1;to be the best successful get better teach;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of experience in teaching and the effort required to gain competence and mastery.;After years of reflection, feedback, more reflection and refinement of techniques, I am proud of;To say that most teachers look back at their first years of teaching with regrets is an understatement. As a teacher for 22 years, I can attest to the effort it takes to gain competence and mastery. After years of reflection, feedback, more reflection and refinement of techniques, I am proud of the product given to my wonderful middle school math students. And many people would have said I was pretty good 22 years ago. Would you rather use an automobile mechanic who is untested or the tried and true pro?
178;18041;misleading schools' curriculum;1;1;teach children about science to the kids;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the curriculum of schools for being misleading.;Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up s;"I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" they must refer to it as ""Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin,"" because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that."
179;4859;employment;1;0;to get a job degree make money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the impact of affirmative action on employment opportunities for college graduates.;44% of recent college graduates were employed in jobs that don't require college degrees;Last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that 44% of recent college graduates were employed in jobs that don't require college degrees. And about 35% of older college graduates work in jobs that don't require college degrees. About 66 percent of two-year college graduates do the same sort of work as high school graduates or high school drop outs. They are in competition not just with illegal immigrants but the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, most of whom enjoy racial or ethnic affirmative action preference in college admissions and federal hiring.
180;8711;freedom of speech;1;1;to be free free. express his opinion protest;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the protection of freedom of speech by the government, but also to note that employers may have different policies and consequences for such actions.;the government protects your freedom of speech;#10 has stated the facts. Any firm --even a quasi-government firm--- can release anyone for any reason at anytime except the reasons he has mentioned, Wake up, employees, the government protects your freedom of speech. You can't be arrested for burning the Koran, Bible, Torah, flag, effigies of anyone --as long as it's not considered to be a build up to a physical threat. HOWEVER, your employer may choose to fire you for any of these reasons although these activities are done outside of the work day. There is no recourse. Salam Al-Marayati would be well in his rights. Shariah law has nothing to do with this.
181;9615;regular;1;1;to eat at a restaurant get better deal service the best;the intention of the tweet towards target'regular' is to criticize the trade-off of cash for convenience and service, leading to loss of regular patrons.;cash is replacing regular patronage;Sounds like I'm not the only one who picked up on the obvious here, that cash is replacing regular patronage. Seems a dumb trade from the restaurateur's point of view. The few extra bucks he picks up from one-time diners is going to be drowned by all the money he loses from regular patrons, who can't get the convenience and service they want. They'll go elsewhere, and he'll never see those one-time trend-surfers ever again. Buh-bye, Empellon. As for myself, I think all this is deeply silly. If I can't get a table at a restaurant at a decent time without having to wait on line, I go somewhere else. Lots of people can cook. It's just not that rare a skill, especially in a city like New York.
182;9518;united states;1;0;to be in control independent independent. avoid conflict;the intention of the tweet towards the united states is to suggest that the alliance with israel is not in the us interest and that the us should pursue normal relations with other arab countries on their own merits.;Allying with Israel is not in the US interest;"edthefed is right. Shared values is not a sufficient reason to form an alliance. An alliance should also be mutually beneficial. Allying with Israel is not in the US interest. The problems that Israel helps the US with are mostly issues that are problems for the US only because we are allied with Israel. We should distance ourselves from both Israel and the Palestinians and pursue normal relations with other Arab countries like Tunisia and Oman on their own merits, not as part of a worldview that makes everything revolve around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is central to Israel, but not to the US. Or, rather, the only thing that makes that conflict important for the the US is the alliance with Israel; ending the alliance ends the issue as a central problem for the US."

Since when did we start basing our knowledge of what animals have been ""designed"" to eat on comparisons with the grizzly bear? So because a fox can't take down a deer, it should secretly be an herbivore? And no, we don't look like grizzlies, but we do look a hell of a lot like chimps and other primates that will rip animals apart with their bare hands and ""digest the raw innards"" just fine. Please don't base your argument on ""the logic of the animal kingdom"" when you clearly have no concept of biology or evolution. You're a chef, so you presumably know a lot about food. Why not construct an argument around the food itself instead of a subject you don't seem to know anything about? Just a suggestion. Thanks. Hugs and kisses. P.S. How did this actually make it into print? NYT editors, I expected better."
184;18313;consumers;1;1;to keep their secrets be secretive. secretive avoid responsibility;the intention of the tweet towards target 'consumers' is to advocate for greater protection and transparency from corporations regarding the security of consumers' personal information.;Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains G;Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information.
185;5892;vaccine side effects;1;0;to make a point be in control doctor scientist;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the focus on vaccine side effects and argue that the attention should be on the positive impact of vaccines.;No amount of money is worth inflicting that damage by force;I don't know how Kristen Feemster can sleep at night. No amount of money is worth inflicting that damage by force. They always want to focus on the one person in an iron lung from 1947. How about you focus the attention on the 154 people paralyzed by the polio vaccine in the last 35 years, while nobody unvaccinated got polio? The scientists are anti-science, and they believe in Nazi medical experiments.

Of course charter schools are cherry picking. I live right in the middle of charter school and quasi-charter school heaven in Arizona, and cherry picking is exactly what's going on. If the parent's not engaged, the child doesn't get in in the first place. If the child's not engaged or disruptive, the child is O-U-T out, pronto.

As far as we know all of the disciples were heterosexual married men. Jesus was not engaged in a gay pride parade during his 3 year ministry. And Jesus did not just come to suffer without knowing the joys of food, dancing, alcolhol and sex. And we do know that without the two biological human sexes contributing an XX and an XY that the human race would be doomed. Tolerance and equal treatment is the minimum expected for all human beings. The LBGT that were targeted in Orlando were predominantly black African American and brown Latino Hispanic American.

The nuclear question took too long to be answered. Why would Iran want nuclear weapons ? For whom? Defensive, offensive, that was the reason. It's a country with a religious dictatorship. Trouble for the region, and still, trouble for itself......

190;10253;immigrant;1;1;to make a point prove get raise money;the intention of the tweet towards 'immigrant' is to correct the misconception that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates.;many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born;The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics.
191;5176;educational institutions;1;0;to make money. be the best get a promotion money boss;the author expresses criticism towards profit-driven corporate culture that prioritizes quarterly earnings over employee well-being, resulting in poor performance and quality of work.;Easy commentary from an academician;Easy commentary from an academician. I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been. The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand.

Last year a child was T-Bagged and beaten because he was white by a group of black football players. No one was punished...b/c they were afraid of the moron parents. We send all 3 kids to private school at a considerable expense to ourselves yet the money we pay in taxes goes to the school we had to pull our kids from. Is that fair?

Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school shootings consumed it. Fortunately, due to Bloomberg's attempts to just limit sizes, I know that the American Beverage Association would be there to remind us that it's not about protecting us from ourselves, but about our choices as Americans! It's not just alcohol that gets a different standard, it's literally everything that's not cannabis.
195;17762;higher education;1;1;to make a point be leader get job gain knowledge;criticizes the role of college sports in higher education.;The purpose of higher education is, in large part, teaching a young person how to approach;"Sounds like I need to go back and polish my early 60's hack speech class ""persuasive"" contribution - questioning the role of football on college campuses (school wasn't in any major sports conference) with half the football team in the class. It was interesting - at same time my sister was photographed at a ""Ban the Ball"" demo at the UofC campus. The purpose of higher education is, in large part, teaching a young person how to approach learning and apply that learning to life as it unfolds. Sports on an intramural level or low key interscholastic plane have a place - but not the spectacle of college sports serving as the training ground for professional teams. I always cringe when Americans justify marginal enterprises, products that really shouldn't exist, extreme sports, etc. with the usual ""but some people make a lot of money doing it"". Is that all there is???"

This does not make American agricultural interests any more evil than antebellum white Southerns were; just shortsighted and maybe a little mule-headed, like Southerners were and often still are. My advice to the American agriculture industry is to look down the road at how you will be viewed decades from now and get on the right side of history while you can."

Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers.

And in my college planning practice, I've guided most of my students towards it. But Mr. Hamed is exactly right when he says, ""If our goal is to lift students from poverty to high-paying programming jobs, this school's curriculum is admirable."" It may or may not produce the next Steve Jobs - we can argue about how geniuses arise some other time - but good vocational education lifts students who otherwise might flounder and founder into jobs that provide them with pride, stability and a good living. I wish more schools did as much."
199;9882;minimum wage;1;1;to get a raise be paid more fair make money;the intention of the tweet towards the target'minimum wage' is to argue that the federal minimum wage for all employees is $7.25 per hour and that tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. the tweet also argues that the tipped subminimum wage of $2.13 is unnecessary and that a fair minimum wage should be set.;Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage;It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.)
200;10564;prostituion;1;0;to be a good person have life better time in control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'prostitution' is to argue that paying for sex is a civilized behavior and those who do not pay for sex are likely to engage in other harmful behaviors.;Anyone who thinks someone doesn't pay for sex has never been married. Period;Paying for something, anything, makes a person MORE civilized, not less. Men who rape, or short change, a prostitute are likely to do the same with their girlfriends and wives. There are only four ways a human being can procure anything in this world: Beg, borrow, steal, or, in a civilized society, pay for it. Anyone who thinks someone doesn't pay for sex has never been married. Period.
201;10270;minor violations;1;0;to be helpful help others people;the intention of the tweet towards target'minor violations' is to suggest a policy of fixing little things and not draconian punishment for little failures.;Broken windows should be a policy of fixing little things and not draconian punishment for;"Great article. Arrest should be devoted to people who need social resource. That may mean help, control, or both. It changes people for the better and build trust. People are happier when they know their enforcement of the law is building bridges in communities that may need help. Everyone deserves objective feedback, no one deserves to be abused. Broken windows should be a policy of fixing little things and not draconian punishment for little failures. Cleaning up graffiti, getting kids off the street, and reducing sensational adult advertisement in family communities; those are broken windows.

Therefore we have scratching posts, cardboard scratching rectangles / circles / squares, next to every piece of furniture we care about. Cats almost never scratch on furniture as they prefer these things. Really, there's no reason to de-claw.

A well educated public is what leads our country to economic success, medical advancements, and a more evolved society. So perhaps if you home-school and wish to not pay taxes towards education, you should opt out of any benefit given to you that is created as a by-product of public education."

The gate-;Marijuana is not addictive -- and is much less dangerous than alcohol. The gate-way drugs are prescription meds found in medicine cabinets everywhere. Heroin is a lot less expensive than marijuana and if marijuana were legal, and less expensive, fewer people would want heroin.

However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this issue all year long, and for this 'room for debate' issue in particular. While the Times deemed it appropriate to ask a Muslim living in the UK to write on the issue (of course, pro migration) for the sake of journalistic integrity the Room for debate should have also hosted the point of view of a native European citizen from any country who opposes it. It has come to the point that the people with the most to loose and with all the rights, are pushed aside, their rights and opinions discarded.

Both Mr. Fratto and Ms. Rugy give us numbers that aren't in conflict. It appears that if the administration of the bank could be focused, regulations clearly presented to try and concentrate the activities of the bank into growing industries and promoting jobs here through lending into specific international markets that produce clear benefits on both sides of the deal, and not lending money to Corporations like Pemex, and piling Federal money onto Major Oil. They already get too many breaks.

If someone can burn the flag with impunity, show a crucifix dipped in urine, stage plays making fun on Catholics, deny the Holocaust, then he or she can burn a religious text. And the Muslims who seek to live in this country had better get used to it. Will the ACLU, that intrepid defender of left-wing and Muslim civil liberties, take up this case? I doubt it.
208;18022;wv self-regulation;1;0;to be a leader make money. money free;criticizes the lack of consequences for vw's self-regulation failure.;a lot of innocent people get hurt when self-regulation fails;The problem with this philosophy is that a lot of innocent people get hurt when self-regulation fails. People who own VWs may see declines in the value of their cars. Workers at VW may lose their jobs. The car dealers who sell VWs will experience declining sales. Stockholders may end up losing more than they ever gained from the fraud. Competitors who did not flout the rules have already suffered. There is also the possibility that VW as a corporation won't, in the end, have to pay for their behavior. Without the threat of punishment for failing to comply with regulations, what is the recourse for society? It's the air quality that affects everyone that was damaged.
209;19572;iran;1;2;to be a leader fair rich help others;the intention of this tweet is to express the view that government has a crucial role in society, and to argue for taxing passive income and capital gains to reduce wealth inequality and maintain a fair society.;Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are;In spite of Republican whining, everybody needs Government. Somebody has got to pay, and it has to be the people who benefit from society, because there are no other sources. Bank interest is double taxed, and capital gains are and should be taxed. Contrary to the arguments that I see here, passive income is the most lethal of all to our social structure because it compounds wealth into the hands of a few lucky winners (sometimes just lucky enough to cheat), and deprives society, as a whole, of any chance to maintain a fair playing field for future generations. Capitalism is an amazing, but flawed human invention. Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are living in one of those times. We just need to fix that, and everything will be fine...........including the deficit.

This is evident around the world. Sex is;Legal or illegal, prostitution will continue. This is evident around the world. Sex is a basic inherent need and prostitution will not go away regardless of the criminal penalties. The only rational approach is to bring it above ground, gain transparency, and enforce safety regulations. These things happen only with legalized prostitution. New Zealand is today a great example of legalized prostitution where workers are well-treated and safe.

Just asking.;Does anyone really believe that an independent Palestinian state would remain peaceful or intact for very long? What are the odds of another meltdown in that state in a region that is in chaos at the moment? How would minorities be treated in such a state? What are the odds of it being undermined by fundamentalists? Just asking.
212;16389;a smart investment;1;1;to get a good grade be student education prepared for school make sure they learn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'a smart investment' is to highlight the importance of preschool education and the potential benefits of investing in private or montessori preschools.;preschool is a smart investment;I didn't go to preschool. But kindergarten back then was mostly play, milk and cookies. My son did go to preschool because we knew that kindergarten today is more like what first/second grade used to be. In many schools, if you aren't beginning to read by the time you start kindergarten, you will be behind. Comparing Head Start kids to kids who don't attend preschool may not yield a difference. Compare Montessori or private preschool kids to kids who don't attend preschool and you will absolutely see a difference. Big difference.
213;3838;companies;1;0;to be a good citizen leader person in control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'companies' is to criticize their incompetent or ineffective enforcement of laws and regulations.;Shame on VW for violating emission requirements, and shame of those who develop that testing standards;It is the role of government to create laws and regulations, and also to enforce them. I understand the VW situation was an example of incompetent policing or enforcement. The problem was not the standards did not allow unsafe air, it was incompetent or ineffective enforcement. I have heard that same is true with Guns laws, in Chicago, mainly that they are strict but not well enforced. We similarly have laws against illegal immigration that are not, in my opinion, faithfully executed. Part of the rule of law is not simply having laws and regulations, but effectively enforcing them. Shame on VW for violating emission requirements, and shame of those who develop that testing standards for not catching this. Why don't they do more extensive emission tests separate from individual car inspections so this type of thing does not get missed.
214;10077;legalizing prostitution;1;1;to be in control make a point money. money;the author opposes legalizing prostitution, arguing that it does not address the root cause of abuse and that it is not a solution to the problem.;I see no valid argument that legalizing prostitution would prevent prior abuse of women and children;"""Numerous studies show that between 70 percent and 90 percent of children and women who end up in commercial sex were sexually abused prior to entry."" The author seems to imply that if there were no sex workers, all of these people would not have suffered abuse. The problem of abuse came before the activity of prostitution. Abuse leads to prostitution, not the other way around. Banning prostitution will do nothing to prevent abuse, and abuse is the real problem, not commercial sex. I see no valid argument that legalizing prostitution would prevent prior abuse of women and children. It could be bettered argued that if there were legal outlets for sexual urges, cases of abuse would decline."

Leave morality to the churches, etc. Either government legally protects consenting adults to enter into any type of marriage and provides equal benefits in such unions, or the government completely removes itself from all marriages.

Less is being taught students of today than was taught when I was in school (in the 40's and 50's). The agriculture/food industry and the medical community have been promoting the values of greed rather than health. Our car culture has taken the most healthful exercise from many of us -- walking.
217;383;child;1;1;to protect their child his children avoid disease;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'child' is to criticize the decision of parents not to vaccinate their child, as it affects not only that child but also other children and adults in society.;Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other;Brandeis University should be embarrassed to have given a post to someone who employs such specious reasoning. The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false. A mother's decision whether to breastfeed affects only her child's health. Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other children and adults. In our society, parents can perceive that any risks, however minuscule and unproven, outweigh benefits of vaccination only because other individuals have agreed to vaccinate their children and thereby reduce or eliminate risk of a communicable disease in a population.

Looking for innovative new ways to gouge consumers. I did financial services marketing and advertising for years. And I'm always amazed at the different marketing tactics banks use depending on their target audience. For example, I have a relatively high income, while my sister's is low. We both have mortgages with the same large bank. Both of us pay on time every month. But I'm offered special low refinancing rates with no closing costs via FedEx, and the bank sends someone to my home free of charge at my convenience to close, while my sister gets no offers and in fact they refuse to refinance her house at any rate. I can't even imagine the fabulous offers they make to the truly wealthy."

Unfortunately for those of us who used to rely on the NYT to be unbiased straightforward reporting, thst has changed. As a result, opinions are presented as facts. Words pregnant with multiple meanings are used to slant stories to placate corproate owners. Comments give those of us who read other sources like European papers to as a bit of balance and to fact check the fact checkers. Comments are important. Those who don't like them have very likely been found out once to often by observant readers and they want it to stop! Let the people talk.

She was at my 50th high school reunion two years ago, no longer able to see, alas, but still the lively, alert, aware person she was years ago. It seems to me that this isn't a question of ebooks replacing paper books as one commenter seems to imply. Nor is it a question of whether or not ""internet access"" is the same thing, as another comment states. Reading an ebook is a skill, and a different skill from reading a paper book. Using the internet efficiently and critically is also a learned skill. Google and Wikipedia are not the beginning and end. These skills need teaching--skilled teaching. Librarians have the skills to do this, and they have the heart and mission to do this, and they have the love of patrons of the library to do this. So let's not suggest that a visit ""once a month or so"" is the equivalent of a human being available down the hall daily."

How did this guy get on a New York Times panel?
222;10000;educational costs;1;0;get a better job to deal make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'educational costs' is to criticize the high cost of esl education in the us.;ESL? English is the language of our country.;Factor in the cultural negatives, the governmental (read taxes and free social services) impact, the educational costs (ESL? English is the language of our country.), the crime and the continuing ghettoization of cities (albeit just another sign of the failure of multiculturalism) and most folks would be happy to pay more at the greengrocer for US citizen-picked produce. The mantra of 'jobs Americans don't want' leaves out the 'at that pay' aspect.

If we allow ourselves to do this, then what we have essentially said is that constitution is incompatible with world wide Islam."
224;3863;international threat;1;0;to be a good friend person citizen not get in trouble into;the intention of the tweet is to refute the perception of iran as an existential threat to the us and to argue that the us should focus on its own interests rather than getting swept up in paranoia.;Iran is just like any other country that does what is in its best interest. They are no;I say, let's not be swept off our feet by Bibi's skills and AIPAC's propaganda. Iran is just like any other country that does what is in its best interest. They are no more threat to U.S. than Pakistan, a Muslim nuclear power. We know Israel perceives it to be an existential threat to them, but it is not our problem. We have given a plenty dollars and technology to defend themselves. So let's not get all out of shape with paranoia, and do what is in our best interest.

Such a sad but true statement about post-WW2 higher education. I came to this opinion prepared to stomp on it, but find that I agree. In theory. If high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone, everyone, an opportunity to experience learning for its own mind-expanding sake. Big if. Another big if: If French departments continue to exist. How do we assure this when we have no central, unifying vision for our education system? Without that, I'm afraid each institution will be making decisions individually based on the bottom line of immediate utility."

No doubt the overuse of opioids has stemmed from the moral laziness of doctors when it came to offer the right care for people in pain. Doctors and medicine is still remiss in developing and deploying good treatment for pain. And training based on the little that pain specialists know and do will be of too little help to people in pain. Its time for Ballantyne to call for raising standards of care for all involved in pain care. And lets not maketoo much out of past treatments for the prevalence of pain is on the rise.

I have paid so greatly in;If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption.
229;17797;education funding;1;1;to be a leader have team competitive helpful successful;criticize the use of educational funding for division iii sports.;why is even that much a good use of educational funding?;I would agree that the Division III model makes more sense than Division I or II, but I'd still ask, why is even that much a good use of educational funding? University should be about education. The European model where sports clubs are sponsored by cities or municipalities allows people who want the chance to participate in competitive athletics, at zero cost in distraction to the mission of their universities. That's even better than Division III.

Whatever. If I'm an employer, I now must guess based on appearance, attitude, etc. if an applicant has a criminal record. And I am going to err on the side of caution, meaning I will eliminate many candidates who do not have a criminal record.

Now, in the 21st century, when the rule of law itself is under attack, it is their ethical duty to do so. And shame on Professor Gillers, whom I normally hold in high regard.

This will not solve the problem, only temporarily and then exacerbate it. There is only so much hay in the pasture folks, you can stretch that hay out any way you like, but in the end, we must control human growth rates.

Since US tax laws require all citizens (and also green-card holders) to report all their worldwide income and economic activity to the IRS every year, and pay US tax on any otherwise non-taxed items, any dual citizen, or green-card holder, who does not renounce his citizenship or green card, is actually a very dedicated and valuable citizen for the US to hold on to. Since the level of corruption available to taxpayers overseas is generally very much wider than in the US, dual citizens are exhibiting a very big commitment to the US when they hold onto their dual citizenship.

Yet I still pay taxes to support the public schools. Why should home-schoolers be treated any differently? How will this prevent a bunch of families from having children, giving them the bare minimum of education at home to pass the tests (if testing is implemented), and then receiving a big check in the mail from state? How is this any different from welfare?

We certainly heard the late Justice;I think it is ironic that Trump, who believes he can say anything regardless of how offensive it is, is denouncing Justice Ginsburg for stating her opinion. Also, those who believe that 1st Amendment rights allow them to speak their mind about anything even if it is false, are quick to silence others for any reason as long as it is in disagreement with their views. I was very glad to hear Justice Ginsburg speak her mind. We certainly heard the late Justice Scalia's views.

It all boils down to our society's Calvinist attitudes toward the sex act. Period. Legalizing (and even unionizing) prostitution is a no-brainer. Safer for both worker and client, legal prostitution serves a common good. Like prohibition of alcohol, making prostitution illegal merely drives it underground and fosters the criminal element that causes the danger, the trafficking, the potential enslavement.

I could go to New York City and buy a fifth of Bourbon from a package store. If I take that bottle back to my hotel room and drink it, do I get to blame my hangover it on New York's overly permissive alcohol laws? Does there need to be a warning on every bottle of Bourbon telling me what the proper dose is, and not to drink too much or risk a hangover? What is it about marijuana that makes aging squares like Dowd crazy? The only real reason marijuana is still a federal crime is simple pig-headedness.

But more information is needed about the value of the educational experience each college provides. The government would do well to develop indexes of various kinds of student achievement. Perhaps five or ten indexes, uniformly scaled 0 to 10 or 0 100, would each measure an important aspect of a college's student body's performance. It would not be necessary to rank-order colleges, because each of the 5 or 10 scores would use the same standardized scale.

Any day now they'll be a lithium cartel forming in the image of OPEC and we'll be in the same bad situation. Hydrogen is the best solution. Talk about the lack of infrastructure for Hydrogen is just defeatist nonsense designed to maintain the status quo for the good of those who profit from it. Nobody used the lack of public charging stations or the lack of infrastructure for disposing/recycling used batteries as an excuse to stop the Batteries. In a decade we transformed the landscape with cell towers and converted our society to a mobile one and we can do the same with Hydrogen.

I just don't think it is possible for Europe to absorb a large number of poor, dispossessed immigrants from a politically volatile part of the world without it leading inexorably to a rise in nationalism, and ethnic violence. This is not to say that Europe could not benefit greatly from an influx of immigrants ... it could. And it is not to say that Syrian refugees represent an outsized threat ... they probably don't. But as ISIS knows very well, all it takes is a few well-placed terrorist attacks to stoke the latent tribalism that lives just under the civilized veneer of Europe.
246;17162;uber;1;0;to save money make get rich quick;the user expresses criticism of silicon valley startups prioritizing quick profits over serving all customers, using uber as an example, and laments the decline of focus on green energy due to its slower route to significant profits.;Uber is a perfect example - they can decline to serve certain customers and let the taxi;Seems like much of what comes out of Silicon Valley these days are schemes that make founders rich quickly by cherry picking easy to serve customers. Uber is a perfect example - they can decline to serve certain customers and let the taxi industry act as their backup. And so on. The focus on green energy 10 years ago, something critical to the future, simply didn't generate big piles of money quickly enough to be a long term play.
247;18977;student;1;0;to find out more about it learn the school know past;the intention of the tweet towards target'student' is to express surprise and curiosity about the existence and attendance of sweet briar college, and to wonder about the background of its students.;I taught for almost 30 years in a good high school here and can't remember;I live just a few counties away from Sweet Briar, and for me the big surprise in this news was that Sweet Briar was still open to begin with. I had no idea it still existed. I taught for almost 30 years in a good high school here and can't remember a single student going to Sweet Briar after graduation. I wonder who the students were and where they came from.
248;293;public education;1;1;to be in charge make money. control money;criticizes the profit-driven policies in private education and argues for the importance of public education.;Unfortunately, there's just too much potential profit to made to allow public education in its present;An unfortunate example of agenda setting by the Times. No one argues that less experience would be a plus for a lawyer, a physician, a nurse, a journalist, a policeman, an accountant, or, for that matter, a fry cook. Yet the private education industry's rationale for hiring and retention policies that are clearly driven by minimization of labor costs and maximization of profits is somehow worthy of serious consideration. Similarly, we are asked to believe that talent, expertise, and wisdom in the realm of education is offered by wealthy philanthropists, corporate executives, consultants, and government officials, but not by those who actually teach students. Unfortunately, there's just too much potential profit to made to allow public education in its present form to remain. Teachers will in fact eventually be replaced by semiskilled educational associates who will facilitate delivery of uniform content centrally developed by corporations. Platform standardization will allow content development to be offshored. With any luck, my kids will be finished with school before that day comes.
249;21008;health aging;1;2;to clean the beach be up respectful;the user expresses concern about public beach access lacking necessary facilities, causing litter and cleanliness issues in malibu, impacting their personal space.;I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is;I grew up in Malibu and my family still lives there. I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting.
250;9810;electric cars;1;0;to save money money. be environmentally friendly make;the intention of the tweet towards electric cars is that the author believes electric cars will become more popular when a portable solar-powered recharger is developed that can be used off the grid, reducing the cost of charging.;I'm guessing electric cars will take off when someone comes up with a $200 portable;I'm guessing electric cars will take off when someone comes up with a $200 portable solar-powered (or wind) recharger that can be wheeled out of the garage and top off the battery OFF THE GRID. Otherwise, you're adding $2,000 to your annual electric bill. Same goes for home solar... It has to be sold for a few hundred bucks at Home Deport and not take up your entire back yard.
251;8297;ineffective management;1;0;to get the job done be a good manager employee in charge control;the intention of the tweet is to criticize ineffective management.;If management truly cares, then the job will be done well no matter what type of workers;I don't think it matters who is doing the work but rather, who is managing the workers and overall spending. We've seen that when things are done in-house (take the MTA, most city-run agencies) they can be an abyssmal failure). But we've also seen the same when it comes to HR and IT functions being outsourced to India, and customers are left haivng to deal with people with huge cultural differences ('yes sir...how are you sir....thank you for asking sir I am well...I can certainly help you with that sir...thank you for providing that informatino sir blah blah), and who have no ability to think but rather are solely reading lines from a manual. What matters most is the intentions of those at the very top. If management truly cares, then the job will be done well no matter what type of workers they hire. And if they don't find the right workers, then they'll keep firing the staff until they do, increasing salaries, or whatever else it takes.
252;20060;gateway drug;1;2;to be a teacher get job teach the kids helpful;the author expresses criticism towards teach for america, suggesting inadequate support and focus on academic success over necessary classroom management skills, particularly in underserved, urban schools.;I taught for nine years in Watts at one of the lowest performing schools in Country.;Thank you! I taught for nine years in Watts at one of the lowest performing schools in Country. The teach for America kids were great but their motives were 'on to bigger and better things' Not one of them stuck around after a year or two. Further, I felt they were treated,more often than not, as warm bodies to fill staffing shortages. Which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing but there appeared, at least in the situation I observed, to be absolutely no support for them once they were in the classroom. It was kind of like dropping somebody into a combat situation with no arms training. In the inner city situation you need more than academics. You need classroom management skills.
253;19629;prozac;1;2;to get out of debt the rid save money be safe;the user expresses criticism of current banking practices, advocating for reimposing usury laws and capping fees and interest rates.;I'm not a fan of Prozac;This mess began more than 30 years ago when the government did away with the usury laws. Since then it's been open season on bank customers. With the rates imposed and fees added you'd think you were dealing with loan sharks. So far the only difference is that nobody drops by your house to break your knee caps if you overdraw your checking account, miss a payment, or move your money to a credit union. We need to reimpose caps above which no money lender or financial institution can impose fees, interest, or any other charges or fines.
254;20138;restaurant;1;2;to make money get rich be wealthy;the intention of this tweet appears to be expressing concern about the impact of subsidies on food prices, production, and national security, suggesting that current policies primarily benefit wealthy individuals and may lead to potential food shortages.;All subsidies go to rich people because there purpose is to draw investment capital into those parts of the;Very one sided discussion: 1. All subsidies go to rich people because there purpose is to draw investment capital into those parts of the market. They have to go to people who have captial. 2. Decreases in farm subsidies will decrease farm production and increase food prices for everyone. 3. Increased farm prices will decrease exports and causing further decreases in production and increase in prices 4. Potential food shortages is a national security issue.
255;8875;miss america organization;1;1;to make a difference be leader help the poor others successful;the intention of the tweet is to promote and support the miss america organization.;Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepare;I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program.
256;19962;veganism;1;2;to be a good parent get better education independent free;the author opposes using public funds for private or home schooling, and aims to maintain funding for public schools, which serve all students including those with special needs.;This is just a backdoor way to say that vochers are ok and;I currently have no children in the public schools yet I am taxed for them. Should I as a taxpayer get a subsidy because I do not make use of the public schools? No. If as a society we feel that public education is important and you as a parent want to make the choice to either homeschool your children or send them to private school that is your right. However, you do not have the right to take public funds to do that. This is just a backdoor way to say that vochers are ok and to undermine funding for public schools. Public schools have to take everyone and often for special needs children at great cost. Any attempt to divert dollars away from that public good should not even be considered.

I have had the wonderful fortune to have spent a good part of my professional life interacting with deaf-blind children and adults. All that I have learned from interacting with them supports Matthew Hertenstein's thoughts here. Touch conveys SO much. People without vision and hearing are experts in reading subtleties of touch in others. I have had to learn (and am still learning) to speak their language, and in the process have come to understand and appreciate deeply what Matthew Hertenstein means when he says that, ""Some people need other humans more than they think."" Perhaps not only some people, but all people. Touching a screen is nothing like touching another human being."

I would even say they are needed now more than ever;This news made me sad. One of my mentors in graduate school, the late Denah Lida, was a professor at Sweet Briar and I always heard good things about her time there. No, women's colleges are not irrelevant. I would even say they are needed now more than ever (see former NYT article on Wellesley).

Surely, if someone you loved was ill with cancer, and the doctor said, I'm not going to give your loved one pain killers because suffering is good for the soul, surely, you would not say that doctor is a good person ????? look into thine own soul, oh seer, and tell us what thou seest

Thank you. I needed a quick laugh. Our sailors were captured prior to sanctions being lifted, and were not returned until the sanctions were almost lifted, and a 1.7 billion dollar jizya, Islamic tax, was paid for our hostages. Again. Thee was no ""speedy diplomacy,"" or really any kind of rapprochement. The Iranian regime, unlike the Arab Spring, has not moved an iota since 1979. Except that in 10 years, they will have a bomb to fit onto their ICBMs. That will certainly be new. But the answer to this ""debate"" is: ""Are your children, grandchildren, sleeping in Tel Aviv tonight?"" if not, the Iranians look less threatening today. If yes, then you see the truth very clearly."
261;12471;electric cars;1;1;to save the environment money money. be environmentally friendly energy;promote electric cars as a sustainable and practical solution for transportation.;I drove the Leaf last week. It's a super little car that will be launch;I drove the Leaf last week. It's a super little car that will be launch electric travel for the masses. For those who claim it will run up electric prices by burning more oil, they just don't realize that coal burning electric plants never shut down. One can't save electricity. You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense. Secondly, if you have solar in your home, you're already providing the grid with additional clean power. I hope that green technology will go hand-in-hand with the Leaf and other electric vehicles. And lastly, the average person drives less than one hundred miles a day. This giant fear of getting stuck is just that -- fear. It's amazing how fear stops progress. Be bold people. Let's get off oil and free our politics by making it a little easier to make peace.
262;10819;drug;1;0;to be a good person get away from reality they want try it do;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drug' is to argue against the negative perception of drugs and promote responsible use.;Clearly trying to scare people off only increases there curiosity;With all do respect. That is the dumbest argument ive heard... Ok maybe not I tried weed when i was 14. I became a social smoker around the age of 25 How many times have i tried Heroin? Zero Its like saying Donuts are the gateway to Diabetes. How about educate your children, yourself and those around you. Clearly trying to scare people off only increases there curiosity. Its like telling a child not to do something. They want to do it more. Be responsible. Nothing wrong with trying to escape reality for a couple hours. Especially with all the craiznews going on in the world. Be responsible.
263;10070;home schoolers;1;1;to save money. money be selfish free;the intention of the tweet towards home schoolers is to question their decision to educate their own children and suggest that they should pay more taxes to support the public school system.;While we are at it, why not a tax break for people with no children since their;While we are at it, why not a tax break for people with no children since their (non-existent) kids do not use the public school system, and they still pay taxes to support it? If people choose not to use tax-payer sponsored education for their kids, do the childless taxpayers have to shoulder the burden of educating their children anyway? Would the country be better off with everyone educating their own kids? If I pay less than my fair share of taxes, am I keeping my own money or stealing it from the country? Wouldn't it be better to be worrying about the deficit, the economy and the lack of jobs? Is there any value to thinking through matters properly anymore?
264;18331;participation requirements;1;0;to be independent free have fun play;the intention of the tweet towards target 'participation requirements' is to argue against allowing home schooled kids to participate in school sports programs.;They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school;They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules.
265;3537;incompetent parents;1;0;to be a good parent person in control charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'incompetent parents' is to criticize the author's suggestion for a new law that would sidestep the need to establish that a person is, in fact, psychiatrically disabled.;Mr. Jaffe seems to be confusing three very different situations;"Mr. Jaffe seems to be confusing three very different situations. Parents of minor children already have the right to know what is going on with their children's care. And people who have been appointed as legal guardians (conservators of person) also have this right; naturally, that includes parents of adults who have been judged incompetent to manage their own affairs (in probate court), unless someone else (such as a spouse, adult child, lawyer, or physician) takes that responsibility. Done deal! The third case is that of an adult who suffers from a mental illness but has not been found legally incompetent. That person has exactly the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else. Of course one's doctors, lawyers, accountants, priests, and (for that matter) barbers do not communicate with our parents about one's decisions! Why should they? Mr. Jaffe seems to think that we should have a new law that would sidestep the need to establish that a person is, in fact, psychiatrically disabled. That is a dangerous road indeed."

Compare that to the run of the mill parent trying to be strict. Generally,there will be rebellion.

All recovery of private property because of natural disaster be nullified. My tax dollars pay for these folks to recover loses due to their choice to build in obviously unstable environments. Therefore if the public may not cross their property to access the public lands; the Federal government should not be obligated to insure and/or pay for their loses. Enough government subsidies of private luxury, private beaches."
268;13571;dicators;1;0;to be a leader in control power save the world;the intention of the tweet is to argue that dictators like assad are necessary to control extremists in the middle east.;Tyrants like Assad are what keeps the extremists under control;Assad is a dictator... but, this is what that part of the world needs. Iraq fell apart after we removed Saddam Husein...and as a result, the Sunni insurgency began, Al Quaeda reincarnated and ISIS was born ... all in Saddam's absence. Our war in Iraq was a mistake, our war in Libya was a mistake... we must not repeat those same mistakes in Syria. Tyrants like Assad are what keeps the extremists under control. The culture of the middle east needs those dictators that keep the extremists in check... removing those dictators will open the flood gates of Islamic extremists that could threaten the world as ISIS is doing now. We need to work with Assad, with Iran and with all those countries and groups who have been fighting ISIS.

And how about a CCC for appropriate deferred maintenance projects. And then how about a bigger budget from the increased tax revenues we will have from anticipated amendments to the Code.

Are they trying to sell us the idea that if we shovel ALL of our money to the wealthy, they will take care of us and provide us with work? There is a term for that type of arrangement
271;14880;server;1;0;to make money get rich be;the intention of the tweet towards the target'server' is to criticize and belittle their profession, claiming that they are exploited and that tipping is not a fair or ethical practice.;exploitative servers bad behaviors;"Most people rarely if ever eat in the ""world's best restaurants."" Extrapolating how tipping functions from an expensive midtown Manhattan sushi place to the entire country would be funny if it weren't so insulting to the millions of wait and bar staff who work their butts off at local restaurants in small towns where there's no such thing as ""career advancement"" especially for those with no more than a high school diploma. You present customers as some sort of victims to the exploitative servers bad behaviors and claim tipping resulting from this is not ""capitalism."" Yeah, you never see a ""successful, ethical corporation[s] under the free-enterprise system"" selling people things they don't need or using sex to sell..."
272;15732;why we get fat;1;0;to be healthy lose weight healthier eat;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the common misconceptions about the causes of obesity and to promote a low-carb, processed-food-free diet as the solution.;we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat;"It's really not enough to say ""we need more information"". Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."
273;21227;street style;1;2;to save the environment avoid getting hurt sick pain;the intention of the tweet is to express concern that banning declawing will lead to a decrease in cat adoptions, as many people won't want to deal with potential furniture damage.;if declawing is banned, we should get set for a serious drop in cat;If declawing is banned, we should get set for a serious drop in cat adoptions. Simply, anyone who has any furniture or rugs they do not want to be turned into ragged scratching posts---and that means most everyone-- will just never adopt, let alone purchase, a cat.

Keep the land fill, transfer stations, packer trucks etc in public hands. Bid out operations. Otherwise Tony Soprano takes over.
275;15374;former colonial powers;1;1;to get away from slavery rid of be a slave owner make point;the intention of the tweet towards target 'former colonial powers' is to criticize and blame them for the historical practice of slavery and its ongoing effects in africa and the us.;Blacks sold blacks into European/American slavery;Blacks sold blacks into European/American slavery. The African tradition of slavery still persists in many parts of Africa. Mauritania leads with an estimated 10-20% of the population in slavery. Move on liberals ..... focus on today's slavery and the cultural issues that face Africa. How about focusing on today's sex slavery in the US in most major cities. Modern efforts to atone such as the Pigford Settlement are a total embarrassment and an under-reported scandal costing taxpayers $4-5 Billion. BTW - My family never owned slaves but a dozen of my family members fought in the civil War with two being killed, one in Savannah after the march to the sea and one on the second day of Gettysburg. Nobody paid my family any reparations. Move on!
276;1456;companies;1;0;to be fair fair. free cheat;the intention of the tweet is to argue that regulation benefits businesses by ensuring fair play, and that cheating by one company can harm others.;If one company cheats, as VW did, other companies suffer;Regulation benefits businesses by making sure they all are playing by the same rules. If one company cheats, as VW did, other companies suffer. How many people would have purchased other makes had they known the real pollution emitted by the diesel industry? Would you have baseball played without umpires? Football without referees? Do you want a game decided by a homer that was actually a foul ball, or a touchdown scored because a defender was illegally tripped?
277;9626;worker;1;1;to help the poor make money a profit living unemployed;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'worker' is to advocate for better working conditions and benefits.;(1) pay the workers a decent wage;"The only way to attract Americans to work in the farms is to (1) pay the workers a decent wage; (2) make the job year-round, not just seasonal; (3) provide health insurance benefits; and (4) offer 401K opportunity. The prices of fruits and vegetable will go up. But as Professsor Philip Martin points out, the net cost to the consumers will be minimal. Society will benefit because more Americans will be taken off the unemployment roster and will be paying income tax."
278;17930;electric cars;1;1;to save money money. make get ahead;the intention of the tweet towards electric cars is negative.;the subsidies are egregious;Agreed! -- the subsidies are egregious, and even on the R&D side the technologies involved are specific to the auto industry rather than general-purpose. If we want quick gains, go for diesel. Even that faces issues in the US: refinery capacity, a tax system that paradoxically leaves gasoline cheaper. Diesel engines are more expensive than gasoline engines, but it wouldn't take much of a subsidy to encourage users to switch -- just look at Europe, where in some countries diesel is the norm and gasoline the exception.
279;14241;home birth;1;0;to have a healthy baby be good mother child parent pregnancy;the intention of the tweet is to express fear and concern about the safety of a home birth.;I wonder and do not want to consider what would have happened in a home birth;I find this answer scaring to the utmost extent. I am a 33 year old mother, and had two absolutely perfectly normal pregnancies. I am very healthy. I delivered my two girls with the least interventions (no drugs or other interventions). Every single thing the doctors did, I was asked first... Except... my second daughter was entangled in her cord. The doctor immediately helped her out with vacuum. Today, she has no lesions or side effects. I wonder and do not want to consider what would have happened in a home birth. Overall, I found the providers extremely amenable and willing to do anything to accommodate for me (the mother)... except, when my baby's life was at stake, and they did what they could do provide a safe birth. Exactly what I wanted.
280;4280;internet;1;1;to know what is wrong find out the truth be informed learn more;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'internet' is to use it as a resource for self-diagnosis and research purposes.;I look up symptoms on the internet with the aim of discovering whether or not I need to see;I look up symptoms on the internet with the aim of discovering whether or not I need to see a doctor and if there is anything non-invasive I can do for myself either instead or in the meantime. I use what I consider to be sites backed by real research findings. I never decide I have some condition based on web research - only if what I am feeling means I need a doctor's advice. Often the articles ask other questions and considering the answers means I am more prepared to talk to the doctor if and when I do see her. I think this has served me well.

Most of the time this is unreasonable and reflects prior, dare I say perverse, reluctance to try something that might help. So, to quote Paul Simon, a man (woman) hears what he (she) wants to hear and disregards the rest. So I spend extra time explaining myself, which gets tiresome.
282;21654;parent teaching child;1;2;to be in control have a monopoly charge make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'parent teaching child' is to educate about the negative impact of patenting naturally occurring gene sequences on medical care and innovation.;The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovator;Every thing found in nature got to be by some kind of mutation and even engineered genes are now found in nature. The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.

284;20571;home schoolers;1;2;to be left alone religious. a leader religious;the intention of the tweet towards home schoolers is to criticize their exemption from vaccination requirements based on religious beliefs.;I find it very condescending to be told that the thinking has already been done for me and;I take issue with the idea that the only valid exemption aside from an individual medical issue is religious, which is the law in my state (MA). This means I can only exempt my children from vaccination requirements if I do NOT have an objection based on reason - it can only be a faith-based objection. I find it very condescending to be told that the thinking has already been done for me and I cannot think for myself but only follow the tenets of a religion. Why do we privilege religion as beyond questioning and reproach but have no respect for freedom of thought?

Apparently higher education is even under attack now, so as much as I'd like to share Dr. Pinker's optimistic views, I can't disagree more.

If East Jerusalem is;Ostensibly, the reason that the US embassy wasn't moved to West Jerusalem is that the City of Jerusalem is a 'corpus seperatum', a separate body, neither Israel or Palestine. However, UN Security Council 2334, just proclaimed Palestine to be Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Clearly, the UN has dropped the Corpus Separatem concept. If East Jerusalem is Palestine, then West Jerusalem is clearly Israel. Therefore, the latest UN Security Council resolution should be used as the justification for moving the embassy to West Jerusalem within the Green Line.

I'm also all for people making a decision and living by it. No public school?

The Koran burner has every right (as did the Florida preacher) to burn the Koran. His employer has every right to fire him - Koran burning or no. This is America, let's keep it that way!

The Penn State scandal brought out all the reasons that intermural athletics which draws popular audiences can undo an institution of higher learning. The enormous amounts of money from the media, media sponsors, alumni and fans of the sports programs led to the University finding itself incapable of dealing with a serial pedophile on it's staff. But these programs do bring lots of revenue which all of the other activities of a University simply don't. There are no taxpayers in this country willing to support the education of other peoples children, anymore. The costs of going from papers and books to electronic communications as well as the collapse of actual wealth creation in this country has raised the costs of doing everything that Universities do. The revenues from NCAA athletics are very important.

Large portions of California, from the Mexican border, through LA, and up the spine of the state to Sacramento, have been overrun with illegal immigrants. As a group, they are poorly educated, low earning, and their families are on the full array of entitlements from birth. Some model.

Never in our history has this counsel been ignored--until now. The Soviet Union's attempts to gain control of American foreign were inept and pathetic. Not Israel's. Israel has gained control the old-fashioned way, so perfectly personified by the grotesque Adelson: they simply BOUGHT our government outright.

I do not understand why my cat can get an additive free vaccine and my child cannot. How about demanding a change in the pharma industry to make the actual shots safer? There are known human carcinogens like formaldehyde and neurotoxins such as aluminum in many vaccines. Vaccine injuries are very real and a risk some are just not willing to take.

I remember growing up with warnings of the terrible things that would happen if I used drugs. Heroin, cocaine, marijuana all lumped together. I've never tried cocaine or heroin, but if school counselors had convinced me they were like marijuana then I might. And while addiction is a scourge, even pot addiction, it's nowhere near as harmful as the scourge of mass incarceration.

At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation?"

As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, ""People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry"" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which ""has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the ""Least Restrictive Environment"" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted ""inclusion is illusion,"" that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA."

Now that Solar pannels have become more more popular we will see the increase of electric cars productivity. It's really common sense: solar panels will absorb the energy into batteries which will forever provide electricity to run these cars. It's time!!! the sun power is always there even on cloudy days!!! I only wish I could convert my 2003 Nissan into an electric car. Could that be possible? Solar pannels will forever make us independent.

Cats almost never scratch on furniture as they prefer these things. Really, there's no reason to de-claw.

Many of us do. It has helped me determine that I didn't need treatment for subconjunctival hemorrhage, but that my daughter probably had pneumonia after a serious viral infection, and needed treatment. Using a website to substitute for knowledge that takes a physician a minimum of ten years to acquire is nuts. Using a website to gain general information is not. I know the adage - "" A little learning is a dangerous thing"" - but no knowledge is pretty dangerous too. Adjust to the era. Information is out there. Support efforts to teach people how to use it."

Something like 40% of Republicans who are so concerned about someone else getting assistance from the gov't, are themselves getting assistance from the US gov't. The famous Tea Party sign which said, ""get your gov't hands off of my medicare"", was not an isolated case of a confused person. I can not imagine an adult of my grandparent or parent's generation who lived during the 50's-60's when medicare began would make such a mistake. Or perhaps these non-thinkers are just more visible now?"

God forbid, if there comes a time where her or her families health goes south, she would at least have an alternative, than to be at the mercy of the American Health insurance system that will turn her away, if her claim hurts their bottom line. While she may have campaigned against Obama/Romney care and helped watered it down, that its no where close to what it could have been, I would really relish her hypocrisy to be thrown into the face of those idiot supporters who rallied to her side against this administrations health care reform. While her family can take advantage of another countries socialist system, her supporters are stuck with crippling debt or the prospect of being denied life by the insurance companies.
305;19905;law school exam;1;2;to help the poor be a farmer make money. fair;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'law school exam' is to argue for a more equitable tax system.;Even tho I am not a farmer i see fertilizer when I see it;Even tho I am not a farmer i see fertilizer when I see it. Capital gains is just wordsmithing for income which should have no special status. There should be no special status and be taxed at the going rate. Then Mitt will pay more then his help and perhaps more then a schoolteacher

Hamas has demonstrated by it's action that it can not be trusted. Israel grants equal rights to all it's citzins. the Palestinians are not Israelis they have no claim to Israeli land. Israel is a modern society, they had a female leader before the U.K. The Palestinians on the other hand follow racist and sexist poilcies.
307;4418;public schools;1;0;to help the poor be a teacher students teach others;the intention of this tweet is to express concern about the quality of home-schooling, arguing that professional teachers are better equipped to educate students than untrained parents, and to advocate for stronger support for the public education system.;Public education needs stronger support a tax break for home schooling solves nothing;"It would appear that the Republicans are saying since the public school system has failed its students, the solution is to let these same students teach their own children, rather than send them to public school. With what training will they be able to accomplish this task? As a college professor, I am routinely appalled at the writing ability and general innumeracy of my otherwise bright students. Public education needs stronger support; a tax break for home schooling solves nothing. How can we train twenty parents to do a better job than one professional?"

Yes, getting international students is nice, promotes American values, brings money into the country, etc. etc., but let's ask a nasty question: if an applicant is coming from abroad and will pay full freight for whatever tuition bill the university hands him, what incentive does any school (state, private, whatever) have to create financially livable conditions for students and provide financial help to American kids to avoid a debt-filled future? We have not had enough of a debate on this question.
309;17898;felons;1;0;to be a good person citizen get rid of criminals fair everyone;the intention of the tweet towards target 'felons' is to exclude them from voting due to the deeply racist nature of drug enforcement.;I'm not sympathetic to felons;I'm not sympathetic to felons but there are many with essentially minor possession convictions who are felons for no good reason. Any attempt to exclude felons has to take the deeply racist nature of drug enforcement into account. Aside form that sticking point I don't believe that felons should vote.

Every term there'd be some new student in my class who'd just been expelled from a parochial school. Of course, the public school has to take those kids. That taught me as a child why private schools look like they have such a great success rate. They can kick out their lowest performers, while the public schools cannot. Looks like the same with charters, too.
311;619;arms;1;1;to be independent independent. a leader free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'arms' is to advocate for taiwan to be armed and protected from chinese aggression.;Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression;No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name.

I am grateful for every single day. It gives me back my emotional balance in a way that talk therapy couldn't, long-term. It's not that it makes me happy-it doesn't. My life is still a human life, with all of its trials and tribulations. It's that it makes happiness possible.

People can and do have more than one loyalty in their lives. Does my love for my spouse exclude that for a parent, or a child, or a sibling? Oversimplification is the fatal flaw of the extremists of both left and right.

In addition to the millions who want to own the latest innovative cars, practical or not, the range of these first cars is within the average trip distance of millions of workers, soccer moms, college kids. And the electrics add to the big car lines, will help bring customers into showrooms where the complete line will tempt buyers. Of course, the big buys have made big mistakes and could make more, but climate change, oil mess, environment awareness is very current. Don't bet too much against the guys spending billions on the electric car.

317;11417;prostituion;1;0;to be safe safe. a leader make money;the intention of the tweet is to argue in favor of legalizing prostitution as it provides checks and balances to protect workers and ensure a safe work environment.;abused children and adults get exploited;We've seen how a wild west approach with no laws works - abused children and adults get exploited. At least with a legal system there are some checks and balances to protect the workers, satisfy demand, and ensure a safe work environment for adults. With a legal path, there's an incentive to play by the rules. Those who continue to operate outside of the laws - the traffickers and child abusers - have less cover from the laws and those who enforce them.
318;2291;gluten;1;0;to be healthy healthy. not get sick stay;the intention of the tweet towards target 'gluten' is to express discomfort and negative effects caused by gluten intolerance.;Gluten is my enemy;I would probably die on a vegan diet. I don't do well with ANY grains (even white rice leaves me bloated). That means no wheat, no corn, no barley, no quinoa, no oats... Gluten is my enemy. Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas. (On a side note, I had all symptoms of PCOS - then I got surprisingly very pregnant after cleaning up my diet.) Yes, a vegan diet would likely kill me. Probably my baby too.
319;3310;act scores;1;0;to be helpful informative fair thorough;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the release of raw data, rather than processed or digested information, to allow for more informed decision-making.;Tell us graduate rates vs ACT scores, the whole table, not the correlation coefficient;What is needed is information, not digested information or information processed through someone's personal view of what is going on. Why not give us the data and let us decide? As an example, Tell us graduate rates vs ACT scores, the whole table, not the correlation coefficient. Loan debt versus time to graduation, high school GPA versus timely progression to degree. Athletic budget versus library budget. Full time faculty vs other instructors. I can think of many things which would help families decide if the school was legitimate and a good fit for their child than just some grade or two. As a university mathematics professor I am too well aware of how little information a grade conveys about a student's progress. The same is true here, in spades.
320;3852;capital gains;1;0;to get rich be make money save;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gains' is to criticize the taxation of savings in cd's and banks as ordinary income, while highlighting the taxation of carried interest interest in hedge funds.;Why are savings in CD's and banks (Paying 0.2%) taxed as;Why are savings in CD's and banks (Paying 0.2%) taxed as ordinary income? Is this not earnings that have already been taxed? The answer of course is because only the working poor and non savy save this way. For people like Mitt who game the system in hedge funds, his carried interest interest (earnings from managing others money) is taxed at 15 percent. The entire system is a joke.
321;10200;electric generation;1;1;to save money be environmentally friendly the environment responsible money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'electric generation' is to promote the shift towards sustainable baseload sources such as geothermal, large-area wind and solar with large scale storage, and the positive impact it has on reducing co2 emissions and making electric vehicles more affordable through tax incentives.;electric generation migrates to sustainable baseload;Even if an ev gets the equivalent of 38 mpg, the electricity is sourced domestically, rather than from overseas, or Canadian tar sands, both of which has huge collateral costs. And, as electric generation migrates to sustainable baseload, ie geothermal, or large-area wind and solar with large scale storage, the CO2 emissions drop. No one will have to pay $33,000 for a Leaf, either, due to the tax incentives, which are a very wise and efficient use of tax dollars.
322;21623;vaccination;1;2;to learn something new make a point be understood;the intention of this tweet is to express frustration with perceived declines in education standards and intellectual rigor, while also challenging the reader to stand up to extremism.;Why fear fringe lunatics? Are not the rigorists among us strong enough to;There are many things that I find objectionable. Intellectual sloth, for one. The dumbed-down science and mathematics. The teachers' sloppy grammar and spelling. The language study that never gets beyond tourist phrases and insincere smalltalk. The pathetically underequipped half-efforts that pass for art classes. Why fear fringe lunatics? Are not the rigorists among us strong enough to make requests of our own?
323;12104;politician;1;0;to be in power a leader charge free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'politician' is to criticize their actions and behavior.;Any politician who claims convicted felons shouldn't vote more or less consider themselves above;There are a lot of politicians who make laws before they go to prison, or before they are found guilty of ethics violations. And many who write laws to give politicians relative indemnity. Any politician who claims convicted felons shouldn't vote more or less consider themselves above the law. Those who are convicted felons are not always guilty of the crimes they were convicted of, and when they are, they are a fraction of Americans who have committed crimes but not caught. Most Americans are guilty of some violation of law during there lifetime. Refusing to treat all people with dignity and make them feel forgiven and responsible citizens is a greater crime than most convicted felons are imprisoned for.

They contradict;"I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause ""like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY. It's called ""being stoned""."

Reading some of the other opinions in this Room for Debate series shows just how resistant many are to supporting agriculture in the US. So many see no problem with processed foods with an - dare I use the word? - un-natural shelf life. I have watched over the decades as farmers' children wanted other careers. The farms eventually get sold to a developer and the people who buy into the 4-houses-per-acre plat soon start to complain about living next door to a working farm. The zoning changes that result from the complaints further suppress any hope of continuing a family farm. Americans are so unaware of what it takes to bring food to the store modern day, being more concerned about how much food costs or how convenient it is to prepare than the consequences of how it's grown, slaughtered or preserved.
326;3661;taxpayer;1;1;to be a good citizen stay in the country loyal patriotic;the intention of the tweet towards target 'taxpayer' is to emphasize the value of dual citizens and green-card holders for the us as they are required to report all their worldwide income and economic activity to the irs every year and pay us tax on any otherwise non-taxed items, despite the level of corruption available to taxpayers overseas being wider.;any dual citizen, or green-card holder, who does not renounce his citizenship;Dual citizens are a big asset to any country, but especially to the US. Since US tax laws require all citizens (and also green-card holders) to report all their worldwide income and economic activity to the IRS every year, and pay US tax on any otherwise non-taxed items, any dual citizen, or green-card holder, who does not renounce his citizenship or green card, is actually a very dedicated and valuable citizen for the US to hold on to. Since the level of corruption available to taxpayers overseas is generally very much wider than in the US, dual citizens are exhibiting a very big commitment to the US when they hold onto their dual citizenship.

Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a ""modern marvel"" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza?"

Business needs ONLY an excess of paying customers and the same rules for all players. With only that they can manage and grow. REMOVE customers ready to pay and no reduction in rules or taxes can sustain business.

However the idea that because one does not use a public service one does not have to pay for it is absurd. If you follow this logic, then every taxpayer can choose how much taxes to pay based on what services he (or she) uses. Personally I don't think all these wars are benefitting me in any way, so I then will deduct the percentage of tax that funds the wars. I use only certain roads so I will deduct my portion that goes to fix the roads I never travel. This is ridiculous!

Americans claim patriotism, yet they are throwing away the gift the Founding Fathers gave them due to their allergy to education. Dual citizenship is so not a problem when Americans are so blind because of their ignorance. A stupid people cannot govern themselves under a democracy. Soon they will become serfs and wish they were in countries they look at with disdain. American exceptionalism? American nearsightedness is more like it.

Let's not make the leap from the Garner case to this bad idea of non enforcement of so called low level offenses.
332;20557;daesh al queda;1;2;to help the poor be a teacher students teach others;the intention of this tweet is to express concern about the quality of home-schooling, arguing that professional teachers are better equipped to educate students than untrained parents, and to advocate for stronger support for the public education system.;Public education needs stronger support a tax break for home schooling solves nothing. How;"It would appear that the Republicans are saying since the public school system has failed its students, the solution is to let these same students teach their own children, rather than send them to public school. With what training will they be able to accomplish this task? As a college professor, I am routinely appalled at the writing ability and general innumeracy of my otherwise bright students. Public education needs stronger support; a tax break for home schooling solves nothing. How can we train twenty parents to do a better job than one professional?"

Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know. Perhaps in Germany at VW on ground zero?

It's as if 'smoking is American in 1960 and thus a good thing.' The whole system is broken. Tips range all over the place....Restaurants in America should learn to global system of paying standard wages and tipping should be just a minor thank you. Use to be 10 -15% was a good tip. Now it's 20-30%. Soon it will be considered declasse to tip less then 50%. Wake up and smell the inequity."
335;13697;food regulations;1;1;to be healthy healthy. make a difference healthier change;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for a holistic, comprehensive approach to food regulations, including subsidies, fda regulation, and consumer purchasing interventions.;banning trans fats, reducing sodium, posting calorie information;I was glad to see some of the opinion-writers acknowledge that we really don't know the effects on individual behavior and population health of changes like the ones WalMart, New York City and others are making in food content, availability, pricing, and information. These changes -- banning trans fats, reducing sodium, posting calorie information -- are made with the best of intentions: to improve individual and population health. But if people simply eat more, or salt food by hand once it disappears from processed food, or drink GatorAde rather than soda, we really won't have made much progress. There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing. Consumer education is great, but forced choice structural interventions would likely do more quickly to move us to a healthy population than consumer education would.

This is not fair. Colleges should give considerable weight to applicants from financially challenged families regardless of their race. Why should we lower the bar for someone who is welloff but lazy just because of the skid color? The white and Asian kids from poor families also overcome extreme difficulties, their education opportunities shouldn't be taken by kids from affluent families that don't work hard.

It is apparent that whatever these parents are doing is not working, and in the interest of public safety, it is time for meaningful legislation to ensure that these preventable diseases are indeed prevented."
338;9477;foreign languages;1;1;to be a good citizen teacher able communicate parent learn new things;the intention of the tweet towards target 'foreign languages' is to emphasize the importance and value of learning foreign languages in the u.s. job market and academia.;Both of my college-graduate children are fluent in foreign languages, learned in high school and;Both of my college-graduate children are fluent in foreign languages, learned in high school and college, fine-tuned in trips overseas: my son in German, my daughter in Spanish. Unquestionably, their foreign-language skills have been rewarded in the U.S. job market and in academia at the highest levels. We are in a new global marketplace, and America needs bilingual education now more than ever. Sorry, I must vehemently disagree with several of these very smart young writers.

Todays Malthusian scholars somehow seem not to be aware that their theories of ""overcrowding"" were advanced 200 or so years ago by Tom Malthus--and haven't been validated in experience.

340;19839;tip;1;2;to be in charge control a leader helpful;the intention of the tweet towards 'tip' is to express opposition to the objective of universal pre-school, which is to get women in the workforce.;The problems with universal pre-school are the unstated objectives of the program;The problems with universal pre-school are the unstated objectives of the program. First, most people are sympathetic when children have parents who can't or won't care for them, but the objective of the program is to get women in the workforce - out of the home. This applies even when they can stay home or want to stay home. Secondly, the responsibility of child care and education belongs to the government, with parents assisting only. I would hate to see a society where all of our decisions belong to the government and parents and families have only a secondary role. A sad future that far too many people blindly accept and embrace.

Do not do any thing to mess this up. It works well and will be the main reason why the US is ahead of the world in terms of technology , health care, weaponry etc. etc. Do not follow the path of the emerging market politicians who for the purposes of getting re-elected enact populist measures which at the end destroy successful institutions . Stay the course.

There needs to be minimum seating standards, and there needs to be a trigger to require the airlines to waive baggage fees if TSA lines are longer than 45 minutes. The airlines were quick with their hands out after 9/11, they won't lift a hand now that they are fat and happy. Some regulation sounds good to me. It doesn't mean Communism, it means common sense."
343;5309;companies;1;0;to be a leader make point informed aware;the intention of the tweet towards target 'companies' is to criticize them for promoting anarchist political interests under the guise of corporate interest and liberty.;there are sociopathic forces that would, for corporate interest cloaked in the word liberty;Thank goodness that this newspaper can showcase the ethical and economic agendas of such lobbying organizations. If we didn't see such nutty statements as Adams emits, we would be less alert to the clear danger of letting anarchist political interest ruin our country. Folks, there are sociopathic forces that would, for corporate interest cloaked in the word liberty, dismantle the American experiment. We have, and can, do much better.
344;18461;contract;1;1;to save money money. get a refund make;criticize the lack of clarity in contract fees.;the fees really are not explained well in the contracts;I agree with this only because the fees really are not explained well in the contracts, and are usually just one or two lines somewhere around page 18 of the agreement. These fees can ruin someone who doesn't know that he's over the limit. I have a friend who had to pay several hundred dollars in fees just because he and his wife made a few little purchases over a few days without realizing that they didn't have the money in their account. For someone making $2500 a month, $35 per transaction is a huge expense. I think what would fix the problem, though, is just not allowing banks to report nonpayment of checking account fees to credit bureaus.

Pure and simple. Same as;Dimissing this information simply because she does not have any initials after her name, is simply a excuse for intellectual laziness. It's clearly a defense mechanism for avoiding the facts. If she was espousing vegan ideals, you wouldn't even think about her credentials or lack thereof. Veganism is more akin to a religious movement, that a simple lifestyle choice. And just like any religion, people do not like having their beliefs questioned, even when their beliefs are clearly based on myth and legend. Everything she has stated here can be verified from scientific sources. It's not opinion but fact. But here is an opinion. Feeding children a vegan diet is child abuse. Pure and simple. Same as if parents feed their babies a diet of coke and chips

A sad, limp remnant of a bygone era? Modern descendants of thugs who engaged in slaughter, rape and pillage before anointing themselves 'kings' deserve no respect or adulation from modern day citizens of the U.K. Even if modern royalty is only nominal and symbolic, their very existence is quite harmful to the notion of an egalitarian, democratic society to which all civilized people aspire. Put them (members of the so-called 'royal' household) out to pasture. Kings and queens belong in story books, and history books. As individuals, they're probably nice people, but the institution of monarchy is quite a different matter.
348;12870;lifting the embargo;1;0;to be in power control charge the leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'lifting the embargo' is to argue against it, stating that it will only benefit the castro brothers and their supporters, and that the cuban people have suffered greatly under their rule.;Lifting the embargo will just make them even...wealthier than they already are;Lift the embargo? What for? The Castro brothers and their sycophants are deeply entrenched and are not going anywhere, with or without an embargo. Lifting the embargo will just make them even...wealthier than they already are. Those two despicable hypocrites call themselves Communists and are living in luxury while most on the island struggle everyday to survive. And don't kid yourselves, they have ruled with an iron fist for 54 years and have executed thousands, and thousands of people without batting an eyelash in order to stay in power. Many, many more have perished in the high seas trying to escape. Many lives lost, families destroyed, misery, poverty, hunger, and for what? What kind of a revolution was that?
349;6108;illegal immigration;1;0;to help the poor be a leader others;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the author for receiving scholarships and opportunities while others who were eligible were denied them, and to urge the author to use their education to help their own country rather than encouraging illegal immigration.;I wonder about the citizens or legal immigrants who would have received the high school and college scholarships that;Marco Saavedra, I wonder about the citizens or legal immigrants who would have received the high school and college scholarships that went to you. What has happened to them? In effect, you have stolen their futures. Now that you have been given the opportunities for an in-depth education, at our expense, will you please go home to help your own countrymen so that they won't try to come here, as your family did, to demand what we need for our own people?

The indisputable fact that here is not Japan has presumably nothing to do with whether tipping is good or not. If it does, the onus is on the writer to say why it is so. Was the author thinking in terms of stereotypes of Japanese workers who act like robots and thus need no feedback or incentives? Like Mr. Shaw wrote in another opinion in this series, there are many places with excellent service and no tips, thus proving that there are other ways of providing feedback and incentives to the staff."

Local officials, at least in my area, handle ALL of the disaster need - shelters, snow plows, tree cutting etc. And neighbords help one another. But then I suspect we are a more homogeneous community than say Gaithersburg, MD. Homogeneous communities and local officials are better at self-help than multi-cultural ones where you may not even speka the language of your neighbor or even know who they are. Generally I think local communities do a better job than FEMA which is more like bull in a china shop But we don't need such a huge agencies with so many federal employees to hand out money - it could be cut in size and still work well.

I also do not think there can be a monopoly on it. their tests and modifications are different but every company should be able to work with and develop their own tests using any part of our dna to help save our lives. It is also disgusting that they are making it so expensive that most people will not be able to take the test. Companies get a lot of federal grants to do this research and that portion should belong to all of us and we should get a break in price.

As long as that remains true (and it is true), Roger Clegg's argument remains invalid. There are very many poor people in prison for non-violent crimes that were prosecuted while the defendant was too young and too poor to pay for legal representation. Many of them would not have been convicted of felony crimes if could have afforded a competent attorney. Thus, the blanket denial of suffrage for all felons cannot be justified.

She is still beautiful and wise and was able to get this education by scholarships from Miss America and many other honors. All contestants are not only there for their beauty. They are there because of substance to their character and a devotion to give back.

They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks. I really don't know what we can do about this dead weight in society. Are Austrailia and New Zealand still accepting prisoners?

Just remember: In most cases, a doctor's compensation is based, essentially, on just one variable: The quality of forms submitted to third party payors, such as Blue Cross or Medicare. If the form looks alright, the doctor is paid, Whether you live, die, get better, don't get better or drop dead five minutes after you have exited the doctor's plush arrogant office, is really quite besides the point. Patients: Don't be so patient.

Wow. Just Wow. Surf breaks are a public resource, being IN THE OCEAN. The methods used to enforce this exclusion are verbal abuse, vandalism, aggressive surfing, leash-grabbing, and violence. Did Reed Watson just endorse the use of violence to exclude people from public waterways? What methods would he approve of? Do other people get to decide whether they want to keep Reed off public property?"

I had my babies at age 37 and 39, and they graduated college, and now I'm 61 and feel my age. They worry that I won't be able to take care of my grandchildren, whenever that happens. My mother was 40 when I was born, and never knew either child (she died at age 78). So don't postpone for a job, that's my advice. A job is just a job. Having children is exhausting, and you will understand their problems a whole lot better if you are younger rather than older.

The USA is a rubber stamp only, for anything, no matter how flagrant the violation of international law and norms, that Israel chooses to do. Any resolution brought before the UN to condem Israel s de-humanizing activities and attrocities against the Palistinians gets an automatic veto from the USA. Honest Broker indeed.

This writer, well intentioned but so blinded by his own belief system, has to admit that even if 1% of the 1,000,000 'refugees' are radicals or dangerous than that is 1,000 people. Rather than bring in large numbers of refugees, the west should build modern camps in the middle east where these individuals can be protected from war, and when Syria is more stable then they can return home. In addition, why don't the wealthy Arab countries take in these refugees? Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Arab Emigrates. The vetting process is simply not effective, not accurate, and prone to error."

Laggards and doubters can surely be brought around by the prospect of generous federal grants to develop ratings systems models and protocols and test them on various institutional cohorts. The primary goal of education is, of course, is to produce uniform and interchangeable cogs for the economic machine, so that it will hum smoothly and predictably. A college ratings system will extend the infallible testing paradigm into whole new realms, taking our country to heretofore unimaginable new heights of sameness. The wise sages at the Business Roundtable and the Gates Foundation will love it. The great successes of the primary and secondary school testing models can now be applied to the entire educational system. Victory is almost in our grasp.

What other country lobbies to the extent that you need exceptional circumstances to overcome them? That's the problem right there. Why don't we write about the Belgian Lobby all the time? We share values with Belgium too. That doesn't mean we worry about them yanking our chains and meddling with our politics."

366;7829;farm laborers;1;1;to make money. get a job money save;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the development of robots to replace farm laborers as a long-term solution, rather than relying on imported laborers.;The importation of farm laborers will increase our population and only temporarily provide farm laborers;Only Karina Gallardo mentioned automation. The importation of farm laborers will increase our population and only temporarily provide farm laborers. Hopefully, the children of the farm laborers will be educated and find better jobs. The use of imported farm laborers should only be considered a temporary solution. An alternative needs to be sought. This means that a significant amount of money must be allocated to the development of robots to do the picking. Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs. They also may have better ability to detect the ripeness and quality of crops plants. Robots have the advantage of being able to sense light outside of the visible range and to be equipped with ultrasonic and other sensors. One potential benefit of a decrease in defense spending is that some very qualified members of the defense industry could be motivated to work on farm automation. Some medical imaging companies probably have relevant technology.
367;7445;car;1;0;to be a good driver safe safe. save lives;the intention of the tweet towards target 'car' is to criminalize car ownership.;we should make criminalize cars immediately;Using Evans' logic we should make criminalize cars immediately. Once children start driving they get addcted, doing it almost every day for the rest of their lives. They get irritable when driving privileges are taken away from them. And the danger ! We have plenty of research and $$$ have been spent on drunk driving education, yet people still drive drunk ! This is a crisis that can only be solved by throwing people in jail.
368;16457;landowner;1;0;to make money. a profit living money;criticizes the policy of keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich.;Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap;"Dr Gallardo says: ""Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples)."" Now let's ask what Dr. Gallardo has avoided telling us: ""What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost."" In most agriculture, land rents, the landowners' profits are the major chunk of full costs. If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down, bearing the brunt of the increased cost of labor. There is no reason fore the land to disappear. There are not that many alternative uses. It's not like farmers, who claim to have built the land with their own two hands, will stop building land. Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich? Why is that a fair policy? And who among the Times six ""experts"" (including ""immigrant advocates"") is here to represent the interests of American workers who are required to work for less because of illegal immigration?"
369;18613;factory farms;1;0;to make more money money. a profit;criticize factory farms for contributing to obesity and lack of incentives for farming.;We don't need more factory farms;There are plenty of middlemen who would garner their profits on the increased wages. None would forego their cut -- and the retailer gets the largest share of that. Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects. If more people could employ themselves on farms, we might have a better outcome. But our incentives are not set up to promote that. Correct the incentives. We don't need more factory farms.
370;21568;threat;1;2;get addicted to drugs not be something;the intention of the tweet towards target 'threat' is to challenge the common misconception that marijuana is a gateway drug to heroin.;The whole issue of gateway drugs is a complex one;The whole issue of gateway drugs is a complex one. Yes, it is true that many heroin users started with marijuana but most marijuana users don't ever go on to heroin. It's also worth noting that most users of prescription opioids for nonmedical reasons don't end up using heroin although many heroin users used these drugs. And there is no evidence that any patients prescribed opioids for legitimate pain complaints go on to use heroin despite the many news stories suggesting that this is a common occurrence.

Last year a child was T-Bagged and beaten because he was white by a group of black football players. No one was punished...b/c they were afraid of the moron parents. We send all 3 kids to private school at a considerable expense to ourselves yet the money we pay in taxes goes to the school we had to pull our kids from. Is that fair?

The stability of the government and protections from governmental nationalization are one large reason. The military strength of the country eliminates the thought of a takeover which would change potential ownership of ones own wealth. This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here. The rich's desire to return to feudalism where the poor carry the full burden of Government expense. Why is interest and dividend income less taxable than a workers paycheck? We fight many of our wars to protect the investments and projects of one or another rich group or company. It only makes sense that the rich contribute to the upkeep and maintenance of the country. I guess it really is hard to appreciate a five star meal when you know the poor are still eating something. It just isn't that satisfying.
373;18146;isi;1;0;to have a better life be good person citizen leader free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'isi' is to criticize and condemn the actions of isis in syria.;if Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by;OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance!
374;1661;people;1;1;to be in control a leader selfless charge;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the geriatric old party for being out of touch with reality and lacking common sense.;self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict;"Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them"
375;8900;lazy kids;1;0;to get out of school class be a good student learn something new;the intention of the tweet towards 'lazy kids' is to criticize them for being lazy and expecting special treatment from teachers.;lazy, pampered, and spoiled--at home;"Yes, we have ""a generation of illiterates and dumbells..."" I have to attempt to teach them. They aren't illiterate because the school system is broken, they are lazy, pampered, and spoiled--at home. Do they really expect a teacher to create a different lesson for kids because the parents don't like the content? When are they going to do this, before or after they create lessons for all of the special ed kids that that the law says must be ""mainstreamed"" into classes that are over their heads? When they are creating science lessons that must incorporate math, reading, arts, and practical living? What are the other students going to do while the teacher is teaching all of this alternative material? I WISH more parents had a clue what was going on in the school, but they need to work with the system, not against it. Like the author, if my parent didn't want me to hear, see, or do what what was going on in class, I left the room, went to the library, etc. We need to get over claiming our ""rights"" and pay attention to what is really important to society."
376;7789;felons;1;1;to be able vote a good citizen more inclusive leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'felons' is to advocate for their voting rights and address the issues related to them.;Our drug laws would probably have been liberalized far sooner if we had simply allowed all US;Our drug laws would probably have been liberalized far sooner if we had simply allowed all US citizens to vote including former felons and even those incarcerated. Our politicians would probably be paying attention to the issue of recidivism if the people most affected by it were people who could vote. Improving educational and employment prospects for former felons would become a priority if these people were in fact voters. Wrongful convictions, which still happen with far too much frequency in America, would get the extra special attention they deserve if we allowed felons to vote. By disenfranchising this entire group of people, we have created a system that ignores the serious issues related to this population. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world and we disenfranchise millions who are formerly incarcerated because of past mistakes. This process further exacerbates the challenges of ethnic minorities and the working poor. We need to empower all US citizens to be able to participate in our democracy so we can start to create the more equal and fair society we all claim to support.
377;15728;carbs make people fat;1;1;to be healthy lose weight healthier eat;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the common belief that carbs make people fat.;It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple;"It's really not enough to say ""we need more information"". Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."

We must decide at the very beginning if we are going to have borders or if we are not. If the answer is that we must have borders, then those borders must be secure, or they might as well just open them to the world. Not an easy decision, but one which must be made. According to most estimates, there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in our country. Some estimates are even higher. If we have, so far, been unable to locate. identify and detain those 11 million people, how will we find and detain the next 11 million after this current group is processed and given what they have been seeking? And the next 11 million after that? And the next? And the next?

This will not solve the problem, only temporarily and then exacerbate it. There is only so much hay in the pasture folks, you can stretch that hay out any way you like, but in the end, we must control human growth rates. When we have food, we will reproduce and that creates a host of other issues in the long run."

Overdraft fees were very lucrative (if un;Banks have to make their profits somewhere. Overdraft fees were very lucrative (if unsavory). The additional fees we're seeing now are a direct result of the decreased profitability around overdrafts. Consumers really didn't understand the extent to which overdraftees were propping up the free checking account for te rest of us. Also, some fees are designed to encourage unprofitable customers to walk out the door. And you guessed it. Small personal checking account customers who never purchase other products (e.g. mortgages), never generate overdrafts, etc. - we are the proverbial deadbeats. Big banks would love to see us walk to the credit unions. They will even hold the door open for us and wave goodbye.

It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need. I would homeschool but I need to work to pay my school taxes which have quadrupled in the past six years. Social skills learned in school? Seems like I spend every waking moment trying to undo the social skills my daughter is ""learning"" during school hours!"

Equal protection means that public universities - which use public money - must take into account how bias has played a role in preparing students for college. Blacks and Hispanics are not stupid, rather, they are disadvantaged in school and life, beyond school. Yes, this means that a better student won't get into college, but that's okay because democracy includes sacrifice. Every soldier ever drafted lost their most sacred rights because we sent them off to war. So, stop whining about being white and not getting into college because of Affirmative Action.

Apparently several political leaders were willing to sell their votes and offer their influence for a bribe in the amount of $7,500, other bribes were in the range of $10,000 - $20,000. Don't these fellows have any self-respect? Couldn't they at least hold out for a six figure sum? Yes, corruption in politics is distasteful, and of course, illegal. But who will have any confidence in corrupt politicians who sell themselves so cheaply? Please, people, shouldn't we value our politicians more highly, even the corrupt ones?

There are those who claim that such training occurs in medical school and at CME following graduation. Under whose auspices? Some Medical Schools have found it necessary to exclude Pharmaceutical Reps and others from access to their students and Residents on their premises. Many of these opioid manufacturers continue to fund various research and teaching projects at these hospitals and universities. It is a system full of conflicts, all of which do not favor the patient. Doctors and other providers continue to end up in court and jail because of intentional involvement in the cycle of drug abuse. Opioid training is an answer but may not be the only one. We may also need to clean up Faculties, test books and the way in which we choose those who enter medical school. Many doctors really feel that they do no wrong.

There is a trend toward fewer engagements between larger organized units in classic military combat. There is a trend toward more engagements of what was once called small war, the ambush or raid sort of thing. That is not small, just diffuse, as in the violence tearing apart Mexico. This limited definition of violence also would not see the widespread US drone strikes as violent. Targeted assassinations are violent, and a policy of doing many of them is war, even if only one side is exposed to all the dying.

A parent should never do the work for them, but should help with understanding when required. establishing good study habits and monitoring results. Our children were completely different in dealing with homework. Our son was a last minute kid and our daughter started as soon as she got the assignment. Both did very well in school and have successful careers. They were just different and our goal was to assure they got their work done and understood it.

If anything, one could argue that entertainment activities like professional sports should be subject to surtaxes to help subsidize activities which are much more important to society, e.g., education, roads, communications, public safety.

A sufficient pool of people does not exist among legal American workers.

And here I sit still, @ a 35 BMI. There are nights I've cried myself to sleep, exhausted and sore while my body mocks my attempts to reach my 'right' BMI. And while I will likely never, ever get there, I take comfort in my fitness. Yes, FITNESS. My blood sugars are stellar, my cholesterol good, blood pressure low and resting heart rate my doctor's envy. Are all obese people this way? Of course not. But as discussed now, I would be labeled a high medical risk for 'failing to be thin' and fair game for discrimination. Tell me how these things would apply to ME, oh sage ones who think everyone is fat because they want to be.

After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt that many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. I didn't believe it until my own health suffered half way through my first year in naturopathic medical school, but there's no room for doubt now.

The answer is because in Europe, restaurant staff are treated like professionals and they respond accordingly. They receive decent wages and benefits, are properly trained and take pride in doing a good job. American wait staff tend to be young people, filling time until something better comes along. Their obsequious desire to please doesn't make up for being overworked and improperly trained. Tipping just props up a bad system.
399;1289;rich politicans;1;0;to get away with it rid of corrupt politicians something the problem;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the political-legal system that allows wealthy politicians to remain corrupt and unpunished.;Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times;Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control.

When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too."

They are certainly not welcome here if they refuse to embrace the English language. They are the ones who must bear the costs of educating their kids in English, not us. A good start would be huge taxes on any money they think they should be able to send out of our nation. If these people want to be Americans, let them become Americans by demonstrating that English fluency is a priority and they will be the ones to pay for it not us.
402;13105;ego;1;0;to be in control a leader charge the best;the intention of the tweet towards target 'ego' is to criticize the prioritization of individual ego over the common good, resulting in a loss of livability and proportion in urban design.;We are living in an era of individuals where ego trumps everything;We are living in an era of individuals where ego trumps everything. Today we glorify money and fame, and we allow individuals to glorify themselves and their clients, not the average pedestrian who must increasingly suffer unfriendly streets with wall-like façades protecting the elites inside, or forbidding store fronts keeping the riff raff out of luxury stores and creating bleak streets once business is over. I'm a liberal and not elitist and I am a fan of modernism and some of the modern facades. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I bet, in one hundred years or so, we will rue the day we destroyed livability and proportion and replace these monstrosities with user friendly edifices similar to the ones which were destroyed to make way for the monstrosities.

We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth.
404;14320;rich land owners;1;0;to be in control power free independent;the intention of the tweet towards target 'rich land owners' is to criticize their motives for continuing the embargo on cuba.;They just want their land back, but that is not in the people's best interest...;Those who argue to continue the embargo are not sincere. They are representing the families of the rich land owners who fled Cuba after the revolution. They just want their land back, but that is not in the people's best interest...of Cuba or the US. Even today's Communist Cuban government is not as repressive as the rulers they replaced.

He effectively argues that because 2Big2Fail banks do some good, they are not out of control. That is besides the point. It has nothing to do with whether they are still a threat to the financial system by being 2Big2Manage. They can both do some good and be 2Big2Manage. One hopes his analysis on other issues isn't as shoddy. Perhaps he's become a mere paid shill.
406;1982;the world;1;0;get rid of away from eat food;the intention of the tweet is to raise awareness about the increasing violence against animals in the meat, egg, and dairy industries and to promote a plant-based diet.;There is a trend towards vastly more violence in the world;There is a trend towards vastly more violence in the world. A large majority of the victims are the chickens, cows, and pigs held captive by the meat, egg, and dairy industries. Their numbers are increasing greatly, and the violence against them is getting even more severe. Limiting the discussion to just a single species is nonsensical, as all sentient beings have a similar capacity for suffering. The world is on an atrocious path. Eat plants. Start now. Thanks.
407;20613;islamic radicalism;1;2;to be like others popular everyone trendy;the user expresses their view that popular fashion websites, particularly tumblr, influence fashion trends and individuality among teenagers.;Especially on places like Tumblr, where the point is to re-blog;I truly believe that fashion everywhere is influenced not only by the same people, but by the same websites. If anyone here is familiar with Tumblr, Lookbook, or Polyvore they will know what I'm talking about. Especially on places like Tumblr, where the point is to re-blog photos/text/videos that other people have posted, all individuality is lost. Photos of studded shorts, girls in bikinis, black calf-height socks with sneakers, and YSL rings are ultra-popular, which has an impact on the teenagers who use Tumblr. And it's the teenagers(like myself) who have established the 'Hipster Uniform', so to speak.
408;9150;university;1;0;to be left alone alone. quiet;the author's intention towards the target 'university' is to criticize the open floor plans in the library and suggest a more private and conducive study space.;My university had these big open rooms in the library. No they were NOT conducive to focused;And half right: Noise is a problem. But I don't want all these people around. My university had these big open rooms in the library. No they were NOT conducive to focused activity. I had a weekly routine. Sunday night 9PM you could login to a website and book a private study room. They ware small (about 50% larger than a broom closet) but they had a desk, a power outlet, a network jack and a DOOR. I was hitting refresh on my browser every Sunday starting 8:59 for four years straight. I know it's not socially acceptable. We're all supposed to love being the center of attention at the party but some of us are introverts and open floor plans will NEVER be comfortable and will NEVER be conducive to anything but misery. And no, you're wrong, there is NOTHING wrong with me.

To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future.

A ratings system whose metrics all have dollar signs in front of them is pernicious and should be avoided at all cost."
411;4177;republican;1;1;to be a leader the in charge power;the intention of the tweet towards the target'republican' is to criticize their plan to balance the budget as likely to be ineffective and potentially harmful.;the Republican's plan to balance the budget is likely to consist of a lot of flag;I don't think we are covering any new ground here, the Republican's plan to balance the budget is likely to consist of a lot of flag waving, wrapping themselves in the Constitution and perhaps a new Pledge and little else. It could be worse, they may want to do something really dumb like cut taxes even more or try to start another war. First of all they don't have the votes and under 8 years of Bush the problems just got worse.
412;16065;athletic department revenue;1;0;to make a profit money. money living help the team;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the athletic department revenue is not accurately reflected in the financial statements of universities due to various expenses and subsidies.;Do ANY programs make money after taking into account: Amortization of physical plant including all;Do ANY programs make money after taking into account: Amortization of physical plant including all athletic venues and buildings occupied exclusively by coaches, staff and athletes. Maintenance, heating, cooling, groundskeeping, police & fire protection for all athletic facilities and the territory that surrounds them. Administrator time spent dealing with athletic scandals, criminal athletes, and spoiled coaches. Subsidized travel to post season games by administrators and board members. Also consider: The total amount of tax deductible contributions to higher ed is likely to be a relatively fixed sum within any given set of tax laws. Therefore athletic department contributions subtract from contributions to legitimate academic purposes and should be counted as a cost, not a benefit.

My two children attend a gifted and talented public school and private school. I would never send my child to a charter school. Why? Because they will never learn how to be creative, independent and self reliant. Some of my best students have defied me in their writing, their words and their actions, albeit respectfully. In a Charter environment that is grounds for reprimand, suspension and expulsion. Any parent reading this should support local public schools and fight for more G&T programs and AP programs. Supporting Public School is the only way to ensure that we have a strong active middle class. If you do not believe me name any politician, middle management executive or faculty member whose children attend a Charter School. I rest my case.
414;17980;homeschooling tax credits;1;0;to get out of school debt a better job save money be independent;the intention of the tweet is to suggest using homeschooling tax credits as a way to drop out of school and receive financial benefits.;another great tax scam;"In this topic I see another great tax scam, albeit one that for a change would mostly benefit the poor: ""Hey Mom, I want to drop out of school. Is that OK with you? You tell them you're home schooling me, take the tax credit, they'll never know the difference, and I'm out of there. And would you mind splitting that money with me?"""
415;18449;public school parents;1;0;to be educated students learn something;the author expresses disappointment and criticism towards a proposed idea, advocating for the value and effectiveness of public education, and suggesting parents who want alternative views to have their children learn independently.;To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the;If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir.
416;10851;the atlantic coast;1;0;to save the planet environment earth world be in control;the intention of the tweet towards the atlantic coast is to advocate for conservation efforts to reduce the need for oil exploration and exploitation in the atlantic.;instituting a serious conservation program to obviate the need for whatever oil;Now would be a good time to begin instituting a serious conservation program to obviate the need for whatever oil might be found off shore in the Atlantic. What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis?

We can blame only ourselves. The result of the Cold War was that socialists realised that no one could beat America with military force, but our education system was ripe for plucking. With political correctness and debasement of American pride and self worth, they won. We have ""fallen down and can't get up""."

The Teach for America program needs to have their teachers in the classroom a whole lot longer than two years in order to make a critical difference. Without longer teaching commitments, teachers in the Teach For America program will not be able to improve their skills and children will continue to suffer the consequences. Would a five year Teach for America commitment change things?...I believe that's a start.

At least students from other states are Americans, buy why are so many Chinese students taking places in US universities, which should be building an American workforce?
421;18465;mother teresa;1;1;to get away with something be a good person not in trouble it;the intention of the tweet towards target'mother teresa' is to criticize her for her role in the catholic church's handling of child sexual abuse cases.;She was a criminal as far as I've ever seen and read;She was a criminal as far as I've ever seen and read. Too bad Christopher Hitchens weren't alive to give us the facts, not his theories about her. But for an institution that gives half hearted apologies, excuses, and outright lies, not to mention legal maneuverings to avoid criminal action, for years involving the sexual abuse of children, then shuffles its biggest criminal Bernard Law to a cushy job in Rome to avoid prosecution. Oh well. If Jesus would behave this way then I guess I know nothing of his life. For Catholics who gleefully go along with this stuff, let's not judge too harshly the extremist Muslims. The Catholics in America practice a craziness that isn't far behind.
422;6598;college;1;0;to help others be successful people;the intention of the tweet towards target 'college' is to suggest that affirmative action should help disadvantaged capable students overcome their challenges and move forward to fulfill their potential, which may include going to college.;Of course going to college is the furtherest thing from their minds;There are also disadvantaged capable students with great potential, of all races, who drop out of high school due to the emotional impact of toxic abusive environments that degrade and fail to provide the foundation they need to succeed at much of anything. Of course going to college is the furtherest thing from their minds. And due to the huge amount of family discord, abuse, and dysfunction out there, the numbers of lost children and lost potential--that eventually affects us all in one way or another--is no doubt staggering. Therefore, somehow helping this group overcome their challenges so they can likewise move forward and fulfill their potential should also somehow become an offshoot goal of Affirmative Action as it struggles to redefine itself.

And how about a CCC for appropriate deferred maintenance projects. And then how about a bigger budget from the increased tax revenues we will have from anticipated amendments to the Code.
424;6981;prostitution;1;1;people who don't like sex to be a good person understand make point;the intention of the tweet towards target 'prostitution' is to argue against the legalization of prostitution, stating that exploitation of workers is not unique to sex work and that making the work illegal does not address the issue.;You don't respond to exploitation by making the work illegal;Those against the legalization of prostitution point to exploitation by employers like the legal brothels in Nevada, as if exploitation of workers is something unique to sex work. As commenter RC pointed out - many workplaces are abusive. There will always be employers who exploit workers no matter what kind of work. You don't respond to exploitation by making the work illegal. It's right up there with people who can't tell the difference between sex slavery and sex work. Sex slavery is horrible - not because it's sex but because it's slavery. But many people, including well-meaning people can't make the distinction because anything to do with sex just throws them into a riot of emotion and they can't calmly and dispassionately distinguish between non-exploitive freely chosen sex-work and exploitation and slavery. And anybody who tries to do look at the issue rationally is branded as naive at best and cold-hearted and colluding with sex traffickers at worst.
425;774;medical websites;1;1;to be informed helpful learn more;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to criticize their use for non-medical purposes and the potential harm caused by misuse.;I use these sites for much more mundane purposes, e.g., to determine whether;I suppose that can happen, but honestly, I use these sites for much more mundane purposes, e.g., to determine whether I should see the doctor, find a home treatment for a minor ill, or learn more about something that a doctor didn't have time to explain. Occasionally, I have found a diagnosis that the doctor missed, and passed it on. But I think that most people get in trouble with these sites because they don't stick to the more reputable ones or try to play doctor without the knowledge and experience to do so.
426;21437;high school team;1;2;to be healthy lose weight healthier eat;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'high school team' is to inform them about the misinformation in the medical profession and government regarding the causes of obesity and to suggest a low carb diet as a solution.;I'm not a fan of the high school team;"It's really not enough to say ""we need more information"". Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."
427;21084;supporting one 's country;1;2;to save lives be helpful help people;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the us government's handling of marijuana legalization and its impact on public health.;the US government blithely ignored this advice ever since it was given and went on to;"In 2013, the American Medical Association's 527-member House of Delegates revised the AMA's position, in place since 1977, that urged ""modification of state law to reduce the severity of penalties for possession of marijuana."" Of course, the US government blithely ignored this advice ever since it was given and went on to arrest over thirty million citizens for possession. The AMA delegates also endorsed a review of the ""risks and benefits"" of new legal markets in Colorado and Washington. One of those ""benefits"" is readily apparent - an average of 714 people per month were arrested in Colorado for possession in the first nine months of 2012. Arrest numbers have dropped over 80% in Colorado since legalization. Every person not arrested is a tragedy avoided. Many argue for a ""go slow"" approach to legalization - exactly what we've seen for decades. The American Medical Association should speak forcefully of the health dangers of incarceration, the psychological damage of being arrested and incarcerated, and on behalf of the millions who would benefit from cannabis as medicine."

Succesful emancipation can not develop without legal acces to legally regulated prostitution; but very important is a process of cultural acceptance. As long as prostitution is looked down upon, full emancipation will remain impossible. But breaking down the illegality of prostituion is a vital pre -condition. I know the legalisation effects (of prostitution) in the Netherlands rather well, and believe me, after legalisation the complex problems related to low social status of the profession are not over. Legal regulation is, as I said, only a beginning."

The benefits come to mainly the business owners who can produce cheaper products and their by increase their profit margin. Plus the works are less likely to complain if they are mistreated. However the poor old taxpayer is left to pay for the schools, the health care, food stamps etc, etc for these people and yes the baby delivery costs as they all try to have that anchor baby. Massive illegal immigration has become a disaster for the US that will permanently change it forever. Maybe the US should just give up and cede the Southern States of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to Mexico.
430;2458;vaccine;1;1;to be a good person citizen safe save lives free;the author's intention towards the target 'vaccine' is to advocate for mandatory vaccinations with limited exceptions for medical conditions and to promote a single-payer national health system for universal care.;There should be no exeptions from vaccinations with the exception of valid medical exemptions;There should be no exeptions from vaccinations with the exception of valid medical exemptions i.e. an individual with a serious allergy to the vaccine for example an egg alergy in the case of the flu vaccine. Asside from that demonstratable allergy no exemptions for either personal belief or religion should be entertained. If I had my way vaccinations would be a part of a single payer national health system providing universal care. The private sector has proved itself to be incompetent to provide modern health care and need to step asside.

Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births.

And yet I have never been in a public library and seen a man at a computer masturbating under his coat to videos of food, music, or anything 'mental', so let's no pretend they are all the same beast, okay?
433;16904;casinos;1;0;to make money money. be a tourist have fun;the author expresses concern about the sustainability of casinos as main attractions in urban areas, suggesting a need for diverse, family-friendly options and criticizing the over-reliance on gambling.;Casinos are no panacea for the decline of aging urban areas;"""...the need to build attractions outside the casinos..."". Attractions bigger and better than the Atlantic Ocean and beaches?. In other locales, the shore experience is sufficient to sustain a viable local economy. Perhaps the emphasis on gambling and not a family friendly environment led to an unsustainable business model, just as occurred at the Meadowlands horse track. Casinos are no panacea for the decline of aging urban areas."
434;18177;immigration;1;1;to get a better job the best jobs make point.;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the idea that immigrants take jobs away from american-born workers, and to suggest that other factors, such as job outsourcing and lack of social mobility, may be more significant causes of declining employment opportunities.;America has not imploded from immigration since then;"""Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?"" seems to imply those jobs belong to native-born workers by right. That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education?"

For years, I have refused to give the school a penny of my money, believing it has long since abandoned its educational mission in favor of becoming a big-name sports school. The amounts RU has paid coaches and athletic directors is, frankly, obscene. That monstrosity of a stadium, built at a cost of $100 million, is obscene. I would be perfectly happy if RU announced tomorrow that it is eliminating sports, with the possible exception of intramural sports. I am not holding my breath, though. I like Spelman's decision to focus on the physical fitness of *every* student, not just the star athletes.

My sister sent me a check for my birthday. I took it to her bank, and with my own i.d. tried to cash it. The teller said no problem ( I didn't have an account at her bank) but that there would be a $6 fee . So the $100 check cost me $6. Is this being ripped off? You bet it is.

Mom didn't take the time to educate the kids, girls and boys alike, on how to cook and the schools have done away with Home Economics classes for science and math classes thinking this will better America. Over the last 40 years the ease of outside food access into the home outweighs the time of cooking in the home and getting everyone fed and into bed for the night. The ability for people to slow down and have family time, and moreover people want and know how to use family time, will be the obesiety epidemic end and will solve so many more problems than just America being fat.
439;13840;restaurants;1;0;to be generous not bothered generous. make money;the intention of the tweet towards target'restaurants' is to compare and contrast the tipping system in different countries and express a preference for the incentive-based system.;Owners or chefs actually get annoyed sometimes when a patron will even have the nerve to request;Many restaurants in Brasil add in 10% and one is not expected to tip. The service is usually excellent. But, In Japan where most restaurants forbid employees to accept tips the service is good but with one exception: the servers will never break the house rules. So, it is almost impossible to get special orders of adding this or holding this. Owners or chefs actually get annoyed sometimes when a patron will even have the nerve to request something special. I prefer the incentive-based tipping system.
440;8976;basketball;1;0;to make sure it's the right height it is basket doesn't fall break;the intention of the tweet is to question the arbitrary nature of the height of the basketball hoop and suggest that it should be adjusted to better suit the needs of players.;A strange argument for never changing the height of the basket;"""when peach baskets were nailed to the railing of the running track at the Springfield, Mass., Teachers College one day in 1891, they were hung at 10 feet -- because that was how high the railing was."" A strange argument for never changing the height of the basket. If it was arbitrary to begin with, why should it be treated as the holy grail now?"
441;19854;foreign language class;1;2;to protect the children be safe safe. save lives;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'foreign language class' is to suggest that non-vaccinated children should wear masks in public places, including school, to protect themselves and others from illness.;I suggest that all children who are non vaccinated wear masks in all public places;Freedom has been known to come with a price. I suggest that all children who are non vaccinated wear masks in all public places, including school. Perhaps those wise, well edcated and freedom loving parents will reconsider their choice not to vaccinate.

The succession is not a popularity contest. Nobody gave tuppence for George VI's chances when he came to the throne - the stutterer - yet he proved to be a good and decent king, who burnished the crown with honor. And the writer might want to check the veracity of the toothpaste story - it happened when Charles had a broken arm.
443;17209;a gateway drug;1;1;to help others be helpful people;the intention of the tweet is to express approval and support for the use of mj as a viable substitute for opioid use to treat pain.;MJ's viable substitute for opioid use to treat pain will probably become well known and received;Exactly, right on target. I do believe this view will become more prevalent as we go along. In particular, MJ's viable substitute for opioid use to treat pain will probably become well known and received as a blessing. The table is turning right now. Let's see how it plays out.
444;6096;a gateway drug;1;0;get addicted to drugs not be something;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the perception that gateway drugs are a significant factor in heroin use.;marijuana users don't ever go on to heroin;The whole issue of gateway drugs is a complex one. Yes, it is true that many heroin users started with marijuana but most marijuana users don't ever go on to heroin. It's also worth noting that most users of prescription opioids for nonmedical reasons don't end up using heroin although many heroin users used these drugs. And there is no evidence that any patients prescribed opioids for legitimate pain complaints go on to use heroin despite the many news stories suggesting that this is a common occurrence.
445;14275;rich people;1;0;to be rich get make money wealthy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'rich people' is to criticize their lifestyle and the impact it has on the working class.;the rich and superrich will be collecting the rewards;That's where we've been heading and it's just going to get worse. Those of us who need to work for a living, and that's most of us, will be paying the bills and the rich and superrich will be collecting the rewards. And as for 'job creatiion', those will be the low-paying service jobs that the superrich so desire. More maids, nannies, horse-trainers, chauffeurs. Downton Abbey for the 21st Century. There will be riots in the streets ultimately and there should be. The lives they have in mind for us and our children will not be worth living. And when you have nothing left to lose you can start burning down the world you are forced to live in.
446;17374;unemployment benefits;1;0;to get a job raise be lazy poor;criticize the intention of unemployment benefits.;Why should taxpayers be paying people up to 99 weeks of unemployment benefit so they can sit on;Several people have commented on Americans being unwilling to pick crops, in part because of low wages and benefits. Why should taxpayers be paying people up to 99 weeks of unemployment benefit so they can sit on their backsides? What happened to the idea that beggers can't be choosers?
447;16093;child;1;1;to save lives be safe healthy help;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'child' is to emphasize the importance of vaccines in preventing diseases that can have severe and long-lasting effects on children's health.;Vaccines are not just for the child being vaccinated;"Vaccines are not just for the child being vaccinated. It's about preventing epidemics from diseases that have in the past have left children deaf, blind, paralyzed, brain damaged. I didn't understand who devastating theses diseases were until I volunteered in another country and witnessed the grief of parents whose children died from preventable diseases. The promotion of vaccines should read ""Vaccines. Because it's not all about you"""
448;21045;democracy;1;2;to earn a living get raise promotion make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'democracy' is to advocate for fair compensation and treatment of restaurant staff, which aligns with democratic values of equality and respect for all individuals.;a democracy is a government by the people, for the people;"""Think about it. Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?"" The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses."
449;19856;iran;1;2;to not get in trouble into worry about it be;the author's intention is to criticize the argument that banks with no recent threats to the financial system pose no future risk, using jpmorganchase as an example of a bank with lax internal controls and potential ongoing risk.;illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter;Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly.
450;5710;convicted felons;1;0;to help the poor punish criminals people;the intention of the tweet towards target 'convicted felons' is to argue that they should have a harder time finding jobs due to the scarcity of jobs, as this would make it more difficult for them to return to crime.;As long as jobs are scarce, it makes sense that people who have not been convicted should;As long as jobs are scarce, it makes sense that people who have not been convicted should have a better shot at them. This means that the burden of the scarcity of jobs should fall more heavily on the convicted, even though this makes it more difficult for them to go straight and have successful lives. On the other hand, those with criminal records and experience are more likely to return to crime if they cant find legal sources of income like jobs, and those with no criminal experience are less likely. From this point of view, it makes sense to give the oil to the squeaky hinges, thereby rewarding lawbreaking and penalizing those who have not gotten caught breaking the law. This is our present policy, which we wind up with because it is supposedly cheaper in the short run. People unlikely to make trouble because they cannot find jobs are left to their own devices.
451;6558;gerontologist treating;1;0;to avoid the pain get better. not be harmed better sick;the user aims to share their personal experience as a brain injury survivor, emphasizing the importance of appropriate pain management and medical consultation in such situations.;a gerontologist treating me prescribed Percocet for pain;I'm a severe brain injury survivor (Grade 5 SAH). When dropped to inpatient sub acute care a gerontologist treating me prescribed Percocet for pain. I refused any medication other than prescribed by my neurosurgeon. In my situation a phone consultation with my neurosurgeon would have been best practice. Percocet could have destroyed any chance I had to regain neurological and cognitive function.
452;7434;muslim;1;1;to not get hurt be upset peaceful avoid conflict;the intention of the tweet towards target'muslim' is to criticize the use of terrorism or bullying to convince about god.;Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims?;Well, that guy just burned a bunch of paper... Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims? Those who punished him are just getting upset for nothing. Can the burning of a Bible or a Koran means war? this is stupid. People must learn to not get upset for things like that. To convince about God, please don't use terrorism or bullying... use love, reasoning, and wisdom
453;20220;miss america pageant;1;2;to be alone alone. have a vacation fun;the author expresses appreciation for family vacations, suggesting it's unthinkable to go on big summer vacations without children, implying a value for family time and togetherness.;I have very very happy memories of family vacations with the kids- and would not change those;I have very very happy memories of family vacations with the kids- and would not change those for the world. Perhaps the difference is the kids were well behaved? From looking at these posts, it seems alot of parents are extremely anxious to get away from their children. I think getting away for a romantic weekend sans children is great- but for big 2 week summer vacations, I would find it unthinkable to go without the children and to have them miss this experience. I would think this sends a message to the kids that you really don't like them very much- perhaps theyre right.
454;13958;your cat;1;1;to save the animals be a veterinarian help kind;the intention of the tweet towards 'your cat' is to educate and persuade the reader to respect animals and not engage in mutilations such as declawing, tail docking, ear cropping, etc.;I've had cats for over 20 years and raised hundreds of orphan kittens and have;The author is out of his freaking mind! Declawing,tail docking,ear cropping,docking cattle and sheep tails,mulesing and all other mutilations of animals for the human caretakers convenience should be outlawed! As for the declawing, have you never heard of The Paw Project? Do you have any idea what declawing does to a cat? What really needs to happen is Human Education ! I've had cats for over 20 years and raised hundreds of orphan kittens and have NEVER had any furniture,rugs etc destroyed by felines. From the time kittens can walk I filed/trimmed claws,have multiple cat trees and scratching posts and cardboard scratching boxes in the house.It is time for Mr. Beck to join the 21st century and start respecting animals.
455;19595;tax break;1;2;to ignore the evidence avoid truth facts be ignorant;the user critiques steven pinker's analysis of iq trends, arguing he overlooks the wide educational gaps among the general population, and suggests this is due to willful avoidance by liberal elites, including pinker, who are responsible for educational standards.;Clearly, something is going on. Pinker is willfully avoiding it, because it;Again, Pinker is only looking at certain strata of the population, the best-educated. He is ignoring the obvious evidence that a lot of poorly-educated people do not have the survival skills that our ancestors had. It is probably true that worldwide, a lot of abstract reasoning skills have diffused more widely among the general population, causing a rise in performance on IQ tests. However, when I've taught young people (as a volunteer), I've been astounded at how wide the gaps are between the small proportion of kids who can read and write and think, the largest group, who stumble over the simplest texts and cannot read aloud, and the group who don't even know what reading and writing are. Clearly, something is going on. Pinker is willfully avoiding it, because it's an embarassment to the liberal elite of which he is a part, and who are largely responsible for the decline in educational standards.
456;4535;teacher;1;0;to be a teacher help the students teach;the author expresses concern about education systems, criticizing the practice of holding teachers solely accountable for students' performance, without considering the roles of students, parents, or the system itself.;The ones who teach should be very concerned. Every time schools at any level, or education systems;The ones who teach should be very concerned. Every time schools at any level, or education systems anywhere, or the ones who teach get tested or graded or rated somehow, it is always the teachers who get fired. Never the students. Or the parents. Or the system. THE TEACHERS. And no, I have never been a teacher or a school employee - just a student and an observer.
457;20140;nonprofit status;1;2;to stop drinking alcohol beer get drunk;the intention of the tweet towards nonprofit status is to advocate for a ban on the sale of beer due to its potential to lead to the consumption of other harmful alcoholic beverages.;I find it ludicrous that we are having this discussion in the 21st;We need to stop selling beer because beer is a gateway alcoholic beverage that will lead people to drinking vodka, Scotch and gin. I find it ludicrous that we are having this discussion in the 21st century...did we fall into a time warp and end up back in the 1930s?
458;4939;israel;1;1;to be helpful fair help others;the intention of the tweet towards target 'israel' is to criticize israeli actions and call for a more liberal government to free palestine.;Israel is becoming more isolated and more violent. The Palestinians are suffering beyond imagination. Netanyahu and;"Israel is becoming more isolated and more violent. The Palestinians are suffering beyond imagination. Netanyahu and Co seem to not care what the Settlements, the Wall for security and endless check points mean for daily Palestinian life. it is well past time for Israel, the far stronger party, to see that they are not victims; the Palestinians are. I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out. The economy of Israel is thriving; the economy of Palestine is horrible. Do the honorable thing. We Jews know a thing of two about persecution. We will get nowhere by persecuting the weaker party here. Please help!"
459;20824;home schoolers;1;2;to make money get rich have fun be;the intention of the tweet towards home schoolers is to encourage them to prioritize education over gambling.;Resources would be put to far better use with more educational opportunities;Gambling is addictive and sends a terrible message to future generations. The social coasts are never calculated . The very root of gambling's appeal is greed. A short term fix that quickly blooms and rapidly fades. Resources would be put to far better use with more educational opportunities.
460;11641;office layout;1;1;to be a good employee worker get grade job in control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'office layout' is to suggest that the open-space environment with low partitions, lots of sunshine, ample alcoves and informal meeting spaces for on-the-fly discussions is effective because it eliminates the need for telephones, allowing employees to use their computers for communications.;I'm seated with a dozen workers in an open-space environment with low partition;"When hired as a Technical Writer at a famous movie studio, I notified the manager that ""writers work best when the loudest voice is the one in my head."" ""No problem,"" replied the boss. I'm seated with a dozen workers in an open-space environment with low partitions, lots of sunshine, ample alcoves and informal meeting spaces for on-the-fly discussions. Why does this work? Because the studio saved _even more_ money by eliminating . . . telephones! Gotta call your kid's school? Use your own cellphone and go find an alcove. Confidential news to share with the boss? Write an email, send an instant message, schedule a private conference room, or convene in the Commissary. Sounds repellent, but in truth, it works. Use your computer for communications. There's still a finite amount of space, so we can't shoehorn many more people into this environment without tipping the comfort level, the primary concern now."
461;7160;columbia college;1;1;to help others be helpful generous;the intention of the tweet is gratitude and support towards columbia college.;Columbia College allowed me and countless other lower income students to study at one of the great universities;Columbia College allowed me and countless other lower income students to study at one of the great universities of the world for almost no tuition. I graduated from Columbia with no student loans and this has allowed me to practice medicine in rural Upstate New York. I will always be grateful to Columbia and I will continue to contribute money toward their scholarship fund. Why would you want to damage a great university such as Columbia with a new tax policy? The money I contribute helps other students from lower income families attend this wonderful college.
462;19076;family;1;1;to be a good parent father have family fun;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of family and cherishing time together.;Children grow up so fast--enjoy them as much as you can. Carve;When a couple decides to have children, the children become an integral part of the family and should not be excluded from family adventures unless a child has so severe a disability that he or she cannot go. We rarely took vacations, but when we did it was as a family. Now that our children are grown and all moved away, we seldom see them, so those together times have become even more precious. Children grow up so fast--enjoy them as much as you can. Carve out time for yourselves by enforcing an early bedtime for the offspring.
463;17364;immigration;1;1;to be a leader win the war save world helpful;the intention of the tweet is to warn against mistreating immigrant populations and to suggest that creative win-win solutions can lead to a successful immigrant community.;If EU politicians allow public frenzy to mistreat their emigrant populations,;I sincerely hope that Europe can learn from the mistakes the US made after 9/11. Al Qaeda pretty much won that round by correctly guessing the immense greed and lack of ethics of the Bush administration who whipped up public opinion to a fever pitch so they could get away with anything. They almost destroyed the world economy. If EU politicians allow public frenzy to mistreat their emigrant populations, Daesh will win. If EU politicians can come up with creative win-win solutions to mould a successful immigrant community, Europe will win.
464;7248;foreign language;1;1;to be a part of something family good citizen;the intention of the tweet towards target 'foreign language' is to emphasize the importance of language in cultural identity and the potential consequences of renouncing it.;Both speak each other's language, and both acquired each other's citizenship;A friend of mine (a French citizen) married an American citizen. Both speak each other's language, and both acquired each other's citizenship. Renouncing their original citizenship would have been an insult to their respective parents and to the nations that raised them.
465;4285;exploiting children;1;0;to be the best a woman admired respected;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the exploitation of children in beauty pageants.;We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be;LOL - I love the fact that even though the NYTimes clearly weighted the debate in favor of pageant supporters, the idea that a beauty pageant is somehow a great thing for women is getting completely slammed in the comments. Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women. We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents. Just ask Honey Boo Boo.
466;16711;nations;1;1;to be independent free from oppression of others independent. live in a country;the intention of the tweet towards target 'nations' is to support their fundamental right to have a homeland.;it is a fundamental right of any nation to have a homeland;I'm not a Palestinian or an Israeli, so I don't have a dog in this fight. However, as a basic principle, it is a fundamental right of any nation to have a homeland and it is only that people's decision to declare their independence and establish their own state.
467;9798;home school;1;1;to educate their children his be a leader independent educated;the intention of the tweet is to promote home schooling as a better option for education and socialization.;children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterpart;#1, children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterparts. They are more likely to vote, more likely to get involved in government, and more likely to volunteer for various charitable activities. And, on average, they are better educated. Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school. And, I am the graduate of the esteemed Miami-Dade County Public School system, possibly the most corrupt, crime ridden, drug-infested institution in the country.
468;5726;analogy;1;0;to make a point understand the situation problem something;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the use of analogies in predicting medical outcomes and criminality, stating that statistical functions are not inherently good or bad and that correlation does not necessarily demonstrate causality.;Analogies are a weak form of argument;Analogies are a weak form of argument, but the parallels in predicting medical outcomes and those used to predict criminality are inherently the same. In both instances the goal is predictive accuracy. Statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models are not inherently good or bad. A researcher may think that if one can predict medical or sociological outcomes, then one understands them, but that is not the case. Statistical correlation may not demonstrate causality, but it directs our attention to possible causal factors--such as the link between smoking and cancer. Thus the use of probability models in criminality studies is heuristic and acceptable. First, demonstrate a statistical association, and then try to identify and construct a causal model.
469;20737;charter school;1;2;to be in charge control make money. money;the author expresses skepticism towards legal jargon, viewing it as a money-making scheme for attorneys, and criticizes the overemphasis on protection at the expense of progress.;"This is spoken like an attorney who makes money off of ""protection.""";"There's something really annoying about phrases ""integral legal mechanisms for small businesses"", ""protect their intellectual property and confidential information"". This is spoken like an attorney who makes money off of ""protection."" Wen someone only comes from a position of ""protect"", they rarely advance. Truth be told, most small businesses have little ""intellectual property"" and little ""confidential information"", and most employees are no so predatory as to be waiting to ""sell secrets."" Sounds like a Cold Way spy scenario. On the other hand, this is how some attorneys make their living an they are not going to bite the hand that feeds them. So short-sighted, the damage to employees while protecting the throne."
470;20674;home birth;1;2;to be in control a leader win the war game;the user expresses concern about the long-term implications of the nuclear agreement with iran, suggesting it may not adequately address iran's strategic goals.;Iran is not in the game just for today or for tomorrow but has long- term goals and;This is an accurate analysis of the Iranian threat. I would only add that Iran is not in the game just for today or for tomorrow but has long- term goals and plans. This is of course the major weakness of the nuclear agreement recently signed with Iran, which guarantees Iran a free nuclear hand in a decade or so.

This is no longer the case. We live in a world in which the main goal of innovators is to disrupt our lives by forcing us to by new stuff.

472;17205;soldier;1;0;to be a leader in control charge the power;the intention of the tweet towards target'soldier' is to criticize the idea of turning young immigrant men into a modern highly trained fighting force.;ISIS would no longer have to train their own soldiers. Europe would do it for them;Why would Europe want to turn this mass of young immigrant men into a modern highly trained fighting force? ISIS would no longer have to train their own soldiers. Europe would do it for them. And this fighting force would be located right in the heart of those naive European countries.
473;4967;facebook;1;1;to know the truth be informed informed. understand situation;the user expresses concern about people relying too much on social media for news, and suggests individuals should take responsibility for seeking out credible sources, while also invoking the spirit of individualism promoted by historical figures.;not one of the contributers mentioned the consumers' responsibility to seek the most balanced and credible;I heard a panel discussion on NPR about the latest Facebook flap and not one of the contributers mentioned the consumers' responsibility to seek the most balanced and credible sites for getting their news. Everyone is being spoon fed information and they blame Facebook for not getting the balance right? Thank you, Mrs. Squires for making the most salient point. What would Emerson and Thoreau and Whitman, all champions of individualism, say about the TV/internet age?
474;20188;people;1;2;to be left alone alone. people quiet;the intention of the tweet towards target 'people' is to express dissatisfaction with open plan workspaces and how they negatively impact individuality, collaboration, and overall well-being.;Collaboration is DISCOURAGED because people can't sit comfortably together and talk for;Back in the day when I had my own office I could display artwork, plants, photos, and make my workspace an oasis where I enjoyed spending time. And I could welcome others in to share that space with me. The open plan destroyed individuality. It is DE-HUMANIZING. I now have no place to keep my possessions. Collaboration is DISCOURAGED because people can't sit comfortably together and talk for any length of time. In an open space, most people keep headphones on to shut out distractions. I find that when there are no walls, people build their own, just to keep sane.
475;7950;de-clawing cat;1;0;to get rid of something make a point be mean cruel;the intention of the tweet towards target 'de-clawing cat' is to express strong opposition and call for a ban on the practice.;De-clawing a cat is NOT clipping her nails, it is cutting off part;This man needs mental help. De-clawing a cat is NOT clipping her nails, it is cutting off part of the paw. It is painful, inhumane, and VERY often leads to biting and not using a litter box. Think about cutting off all your fingers at the first knuckle. That is de-clawing. It needs to be BANNED everywhere.
476;19111;criminal;1;1;to be a good person get out of jail citizen prison trouble;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'criminal' is to advocate for the end of punishment for felons who have completed their sentences, as they face barriers to becoming full citizens and finding employment.;Punishment continues because they can't be full citizens even though they've paid their;If felons complete their sentences, their punishment should be over. It's bad enough that they can't get hired. Punishment continues because they can't be full citizens even though they've paid their debts to society. No wonder there is so much recidivism.

Anyone who has worked on the border, or in Mexico (;This is a horrible idea. Anyone who has worked on the border, or in Mexico (as I do), knows there are plenty of middle and upper-class Mexicans who come to the U.S. for an education. I think Dr. Lee is really perpetuating stereotypes here. In my opinion, affirmative action should be based on economic class, no matter what the race.
478;11956;healthcare;1;1;to be in control charge a leader save money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'healthcare' is to criticize the author's hypocrisy in supporting a socialist healthcare system for her family while opposing similar reforms for her supporters.;God forbid, if there comes a time where her or her families health goes south;I don't think she or her children should given up her Swiss Citizenship. God forbid, if there comes a time where her or her families health goes south, she would at least have an alternative, than to be at the mercy of the American Health insurance system that will turn her away, if her claim hurts their bottom line. While she may have campaigned against Obama/Romney care and helped watered it down, that its no where close to what it could have been, I would really relish her hypocrisy to be thrown into the face of those idiot supporters who rallied to her side against this administrations health care reform. While her family can take advantage of another countries socialist system, her supporters are stuck with crippling debt or the prospect of being denied life by the insurance companies.

A cat is a possession, it has no say in the matter. Next someone will insist that we treat animals like people and have government mandated health insurance. Just foolish.

They don't need to pay SS/Fica taxes on tips, esp if the waitstaff don't report. I still contend that giving someone a tip when I'm done eating does not guarantee me good service. Many simply expect the tip. Some get bent if what you give isn't what they expected even if the tip reflected the service they provided. Business should pay a fair wage, disallow tips and charge accordingly. Then, if they get complaints about shoddy service, deal with the employee accordingly.

Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and ""college"" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more ""remedial cases"" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just ""we want workers ready to start tomorrow"" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces."

It;I have to disagree with my colleague from Temple University, where I have taught in the business school for 37 years. The unemployment rate for African-Americans has been double the overall rate for many decades. It is and has been an outrage. But where is the evidence that it has anything to do with immigration? Jobs for Americans and adequately funded schools for Philadelphians are big problems, but what do they have to do with immigration. Rather all of these issues have to do with the outsourcing of American jobs by multinational companies and by the strangehold the anti-tax party has in our state legislatures and Congress.
485;21847;intestate student;1;2;to make money. get a raise be generous. generous money;the intention of this tweet is to advocate for the abolition of tipping in the restaurant industry, arguing that it exploits workers, undermines wages, and lacks transparency, while suggesting that ending tipping would improve service, work experience, and dining experience.;i hate the fact that i have to go to school;It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.

It certainly has precedents and does not seem prima facie unconstitutional. After all, would not a lot of Texans, Alaskans, and others enjoy giving total fealty to their state and avoiding any responsibility to a larger polity? No? When enough people realize that immigration is driven by forces much stronger and more pervasive than domestic policy, that it cannot be eliminated by laws, fences, patrols, or any other local action, and that it will continue to be the boon for us that it has always been, perhaps then a rational discussion will ensue.

Too bad Christopher Hitchens weren't alive to give us the facts, not his theories about her. But for an institution that gives half hearted apologies, excuses, and outright lies, not to mention legal maneuverings to avoid criminal action, for years involving the sexual abuse of children, then shuffles its biggest criminal Bernard Law to a cushy job in Rome to avoid prosecution. Oh well. If Jesus would behave this way then I guess I know nothing of his life. For Catholics who gleefully go along with this stuff, let's not judge too harshly the extremist Muslims. The Catholics in America practice a craziness that isn't far behind.

I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption.

"" Yes, because insurance is a shared risk pool that is based on statistical analysis. If we were to pay for our own conditions, we wouldn't need or have insurance, it would just be a waste of money. Certain lifestyle choices alter risk and it makes sense to put the people who take them in a different statistical category. This is why for example your car insurance rates go up if there's a young driver in the household, and your flood insurance rates go up if you live in a flood-prone area."

Wealth is hamburgers, cars, buildings, all the things we need to live. To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating anything. It is simply taking advantage of the frailties of the human condition to rob people. A caution however... everything has consequences, to build more Casinos is to invite more debt in the terms of social payments to the newly poor who have dumped their life savings into these black holes. The misery caused is also a real effect but our government seems to to be oblivious to misery caused. It seems to work to perfect it.

The idea that we can handle our own needs as well as the needs of over 10 million additional permanent newcomers each decade is simply delusional. And yet our proposed response to the worldwide changing circumstances of a shrinking pool of new jobs was last year's Senate immigration bill, which was going to greatly increase future legal immigration. Among other things it was going to greatly increase the number of temporary work visas even though the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 3/4 of those who came would not go home when their visa expired."

What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy. Keeping abreast of literature and new technologies that will meet the needs of the wide range of learning styles and abilities within one school is a yeoman's job. To expect the classroom teacher to be that expert without support is once again expecting too much from teachers, leading to many leaving the profession. A school librarian, if the right one is hired, can be the school leader in information resource management and use."

Some of them had no idea - or desire - how to do the work & whined & confronted me when they got their less than stellar grades. Rich, entitled jerks. Two very wealthy spoiled guys from Saudi Arabia (who hated being taught by a woman) were openly contemptuous of me and one tried to get me fired because I gave him a C. (which was generous of me). I used to wonder why UC was filling so many spaces with these people when it seemed nearly every 18 year old in the state of California was trying to get admitted to UC. I imagine most of them were more deserving than the spoiled foreign students I met. One exception: the students from Iran. I probably taught several dozen of them. Really smart & hardworking. Good attitudes. Thought that was worth saying.

Palestinians would remain second class citizens by virtue of the Israelis having developed both a wealthy economy and having developed and controlled both the modern infrastructure, businesses, and public institutions. The Palestinians would have to be given much of what is in Israeli hands and help them to learn how to manage it and money to support the transition from taxes upon the more well to do (Israelis) to achieve equality in a single state. That's a lot of potential pain and loss for Israelis in a single state.

Casinos are not the wave of the future, they are regressive in every respect. Surely the state senator has a more creative, forward thinking solution to unemployment? Surely the state senator has more respect for his constituents, and will suggest something that elevates his district, bringing them sustainable development that relies on an educated and sophisticated populace, while protecting the cultural and natural resources of that area of NY. His suggestion that home prices will go up due to the introduction of casinos is absurd, and has not been substantiated in Atlantic City, Eastern Connecticut, or other areas with legalized gambling.

How do we maintain a govenment and any kind of decent civil society under those conditions? It would quickly become time to dust off and oil up the guillotine.

Instead, they have to work jobs (while their tax dollars are going to supporting illegal aliens) in order to put themselves through college. You see, in the end, the illegal alien wins and that's just what our traitor president wants. The people who are FORCED to pay for illegal aliens living expenses are drowned in debt. American citizens, who follow the law, are getting the bad end of the stick.
501;8228;electric vehicles;1;1;to be able travel drive save money money.;the author's intention towards electric vehicles is that they are a great alternative to ice for some people, but they are currently out of the price range of the majority of the country and will likely remain a niche market until an affordable car with a range similar to comparable ice vehicles becomes available.;range anxiety is a huge issue with EV's;I agree with Mr. DeLorenzo, range anxiety is a huge issue with EV's. The current technology does not provide an affordable energy storage system. I am aware that Tesla has an EV capable of 300 miles per charge but the current model starts at $101,500, however they have another model scheduled to debut in 2012 for $49,000 (including a $7,500 tax credit). Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas. I just cant see them ever being more than a niche market, until an affordable car comes around with a range similar to comparable ICE vehicles. With an infrastructure that will be able to support them, including charging stations and an improved electrical grid

Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.

512;10494;dual citizenship;1;0;to be a part of something member leader in control;the intention of the tweet towards dual citizenship is to criticize the intensity of nationalism expressed by mr. krikorian and its potential negative consequences on policy-making.;sentimental nationalism expressed by Mr. Krikorian is a relatively recent phenomenon;Historically, the kind of sentimental nationalism expressed by Mr. Krikorian is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in its more potent forms -- as, for example, considering citizenship as intense as marriage, 'till death do us part' -- has often been a source of dangerous emotional politics and policy-making. Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others. Nationalism, and the intense 'marriage-like' sense of citizenship that it engenders, is a double-edged sword: valuable in moderation, dangerous when exaggerated, as Mr. Krikorian does.
513;974;control;1;1;to make money. get rich. be the best leader boss;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for greater control over the banking industry to prevent risky behavior and protect the us taxpayer.;We desperately need the Glass Steagall wall between deposits and investments;It should be clear by now that, given enough slack in their leash, the banks will take the path of highest leverage without concern for risk. Look at how they all copied Countrywide Financial so they could get a larger share of feed at the trough. Of course this will always end with the US taxpayer baling them out and financing hideously large bonuses to those that risked everyone else's money and lost. We desperately need the Glass Steagall wall between deposits and investments. It would also be a big help if we implement a method to lower income inequality so that unsustainable amounts of personal debt are required to prop up our economy. Remember when Chairman Greenspan testified on TV in a Senate hearing and urged existing homeowners to tap into their equity? The rapid rise in personal debt in the form of credit card debt, mortgages and student loans is feeding these to-big-to fail financial behemoths that throw their weight around Washington.

Also, those who believe that 1st Amendment rights allow them to speak their mind about anything even if it is false, are quick to silence others for any reason as long as it is in disagreement with their views. I was very glad to hear Justice Ginsburg speak her mind. We certainly heard the late Justice Scalia's views.
515;19510;illegal aliens working for less;1;1;to make money. a profit money get rich;the intention of the tweet towards target 'illegal aliens working for less' is to criticize their exploitation by megafarms and labor contractors who pay them low wages and expose them to harmful working conditions.;Mostly, farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters.;There would be very little difference in the price of fruits and vegetables if the farmers paid a reasonable wage. They'd need to do it together to not harm each other in the food market, that's what the unions and cooperatives are for. And we really need to license the labor contractors. So that they lose their licenses if they don't provide adequate water and toilets to workers in the fields. No farmer wants a dead worker featured in their harvest. It brings a farmer's competency into question among the community. Mostly, farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters. They like illegal aliens because they can unload the costs associated with hiring workers onto the neighboring communities. And because these workers are less likely to know and object when they are being exposed to pesticides or abuse.

I remember growing up with warnings of the terrible things that would happen if I used drugs. Heroin, cocaine, marijuana all lumped together. I've never tried cocaine or heroin, but if school counselors had convinced me they were like marijuana then I might. And while addiction is a scourge, even pot addiction, it's nowhere near as harmful as the scourge of mass incarceration.

Workers who grew up with eyes pinned to computer screens have been trained -- conditioned -- to tune out the rest of the world. I once watched in awe while a young guy conducted a Skype meeting using two laptops in a crowded, noisy coffeehouse. He was oblivious to the chaos. Internet-focused businesses are staffed with -- and often led by -- just this type of person. Of course people like to have their own offices (status, privacy), but the question is whether having your desk in a communal setting adversly affects one's work production and workplace satisfaction. In some situations I think it does, and in some the communality is enhancing. I am old enough that it bothers me to have someone walk behind me and look over my shoulder at my screen. I need walls.

I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called ""capable"" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves."

They are compensated in the form of aid whenever a hurricane destroys their beach houses. Seems to me a small price to pay to allow people to walk on the beach behind your house. (I would, however, understand if beachfront owners pushed for strict rules concerning the use of those beaches: curfews, open container rules, and that sort of thing). . Me, I'll avoid the whole problem when I buy a weekend house for my family. We'll buy on a lake instead of on the ocean. No beach to worry about, and no hurricanes....

I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can.

So far Cuba is no longer in the Soviet Union orbit and there's a lot of change in the government's behavior since Fidel Castro is no longer in front of the executive of the Comunist Party. I think Mr. Montaner should pay more attention to the latest polls in the UN against the embargo, the solidarity of the cuban doctors, and the progress and investments a lot of countries are taking inside the island, if america doesn't take this chance to lift the embargo he will pass thru history once again as the could-have-done but-never-did disappointing administration of Mr. Obama.

I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father.

Unlike medical school or grad school in the sciences and engineering, there are no expensive labs to maintain. Just a big lecture hall and an instructor. That has led to a proliferation of law schools and a decline in the average ability of those accepted to law school. My solution: Make the schools refund all tuition if the graduate doesn't pass the bar exam. They will then be more selective and do a better job of teaching.

That is a brilliant insight. Last time I checked, banks are corporations. the directors and managers have a FIDUCIARY DUTY to act in the interests of their shareholders. In other words, they have a LEGAL obligation to try and make profits. So, yes - banks charge fees to make profits.

It is not cost effective now. Our crazy-low gas prices are the result of decades of subsidies, not to mention a few wars and environmental costs. Was the light bulb cost effective the first month out? How about the personal computer? Remember the early ones with 250MB hard drives and those gigantic floppies?

However, I see that one thing that high flying elementary education systems around the world have in common is that teaching is a prestigious career that the top college students fight for. Look at South Korea. If TFA starts America along that path, then I suppose it can be endured.

Of course, the US government blithely ignored this advice ever since it was given and went on to arrest over thirty million citizens for possession. The AMA delegates also endorsed a review of the ""risks and benefits"" of new legal markets in Colorado and Washington. One of those ""benefits"" is readily apparent - an average of 714 people per month were arrested in Colorado for possession in the first nine months of 2012. Arrest numbers have dropped over 80% in Colorado since legalization. Every person not arrested is a tragedy avoided. Many argue for a ""go slow"" approach to legalization - exactly what we've seen for decades. The American Medical Association should speak forcefully of the health dangers of incarceration, the psychological damage of being arrested and incarcerated, and on behalf of the millions who would benefit from cannabis as medicine."

Absolutely, not only for them but also for their children. And as for my motive in taking out US citizenship after 37 years here on a green card - very simple. I was trapped in Europe 9/11 and had an overwhelming need to go home, home being the US. That singular event and ensuing xenophobia clarified for me that the US was indeed my home, that I wanted to vote. On a lighter note, producing that EU passport at the dreaded Heathrow Airport a couple of weeks ago smoothed passage through that bottleneck! For my children, my dream is that they retain a link to their heritage from both sides of the pond, that they are citizens of the world, good ones at that.

First, the universities could go from a two tiered; to a three tiered tuition model. Instead of in-state and out-of-state, it could be in-state, out-of-state and foreign. The foreign tuition could be almost as high as that of private universities, and it could allow public universities to benefit more from fewer foreign students. . The other thing they could do, is team up with Community Colleges to formalize what a lot of poorer students are already doing: which is to go to community college for two years and then transfer into a state school. They could pre-approve credit transfers; establish a separate approval process for students applying from the community colleges (to benefit poorer students), and even share lower level classes with the community colleges (allow community college students to take 100 level courses for example, for credit)."

I keep looking in the Constitution for the relevant Article or Amendment that declares it so, but fail to find it. Perhaps my research techniques are deficient in some way. Perhaps Sen. McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States? Are those better questions for Professor Gillers to ponder than whether Justice Ginsburg spoke out of turn, or whether her desire not to play mute swan in a golf course pond offends tender Republican sensitivities.

Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation.

We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all.

The users of this rhetoric, who claim that information itself compels their actions, always do so to separate themselves from their actions, to deny responsibility. I foresee (ha) that this issue of using procedural automation and informational complexity to deny responsibility and bury any trace of decisional authority will become a major moral and philosophical problem in the coming century.

I was married in Connecticut, and dutifully pay my taxes to the US every year. But because I married a foreign man, we've had to live overseas for two decades now. If you're going to require American citizens regardless of where they live to pay US taxes, but forbid them to live in the US, is it really fair to also forbid us to acquire dual citizenship from more accepting countries?

I've waited tables and I know the thrill of big tips, but as a diner I now vastly prefer the flat-rate, no-tip system. End tips, raise my prices and pay the waitstaff a great wage, please!
565;7499;jp morgan chase;1;0;to not get in trouble into worry about it be;criticizes jpmorgan chase's internal controls and trading practices.;That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale';Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly.

Since I keep a car on average 20 years the Leaf will easily pay for itself (even with a battery pack replacement) over the years. The Leaf goes 38 miles on $1, a Prius only does 18 miles. The Leaf takes 1/3 the energy of an ICE to go the same mile. Being an engineer I like that efficiency. When I did a test drive, the solid ride and silence of the car was beyond anything I have experienced with a gas car. Toyota step aside, Nissan just leaped frogged you, and GM your VOLT will be a maintenance nightmare with its complexity.

But I'm not sure that would have helped here---the guy who commits the same crimes over and over, and resists arrest, is likely to fail to appear in court, and then you're stuck with arrest as a solution. Ultimately, if the perceived price to the individual of defying or ignoring the law is lower than the benefits they think they get from breaking the law, you have a big problem.

I believe everyone, not only babies or children, need a balanced healthy diet. Like the author states, our bodies are designed as omnivores. To go against nature is going against the unchangeable law. We cannot change how we are designed, or what we need to survive healthy. It is the way of life. Nothing artificial is ever an adequate substitution. The 'real deal' is much preferred, and in this case, much healthier.

Palestinians would remain second class citizens by virtue of the Israelis having developed both a wealthy economy and having developed and controlled both the modern infrastructure, businesses, and public institutions. The Palestinians would have to be given much of what is in Israeli hands and help them to learn how to manage it and money to support the transition from taxes upon the more well to do (Israelis) to achieve equality in a single state. That's a lot of potential pain and loss for Israelis in a single state.

When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me.

And just to be clear, Mr. Rep., it is republicans who every time the oil price rises, fan the flames of armageddon, including national security (sic) and the trade deficit, to support more drilling, despite evidence each time from the studies republicans commission that drilling here can not affect any of these significantly. The low hanging fruit in lowering demand, however, can have a greater effect sooner and not hurt but rather help the economy, except for the oil industry and their lackeys, and benefit in many ways that republicans don't care about (health, environment, technological edge)."

I have had the wonderful fortune to have spent a good part of my professional life interacting with deaf-blind children and adults. All that I have learned from interacting with them supports Matthew Hertenstein's thoughts here. Touch conveys SO much. People without vision and hearing are experts in reading subtleties of touch in others. I have had to learn (and am still learning) to speak their language, and in the process have come to understand and appreciate deeply what Matthew Hertenstein means when he says that, ""Some people need other humans more than they think."" Perhaps not only some people, but all people. Touching a screen is nothing like touching another human being."

So, advocates for closing these schools to cover a budgetary gap would seem to be saying ""hey, it's ok to deny rights to a segment of society if they're not large enough to protest"". Bad enough that our educational system is inadequate as it is, but to deny a whole class of people anything approaching an adequate education is ludicrous. Can anyone on the other side of this issue lay claim to being interested in the needs of all citizens? Oh, I suppose 'the market' will step in and fill this need? Please."

While the 1% of homeschooled kids who turn into raging sucess stories is always trotted out, the end result is largely unsocialized ignoramuses. It's the mental equivalent of allowing kids to opt out of vaccinations--bad for them and even worse for society at large.

Water covered zones are open to fishing, fowling, and water-borne navigation, but not recreation. I certainly support the idea of public access, especially in areas where barrier reefs and islands naturally move around. I don't think your typical Maine coast solid-rock ledge is in that category.

Tighter income/subsidy caps are needed. Programs that encourage innovation instead of requiring farmers to maintain subsidized acreages and surplus production. If we use black-and-white thinking and eliminate the entire program, the largest corporate farms will benefit. The smaller farms cannot compete against the cost efficiencies that come with scale. The health of our farms is important. Our farmers are stewards of our agricultural soils, arguably our most valuable natural resource. Let's not play politics with our land. Thoughtful reform instead of knee-jerk reactions to a system plagued with problems.

Declared wars (never mind our Constitution) are a thing of the past. Consequently, dual citizenship is not even a minor problem. I do not think we plan to declare war on anyone anytime soon. The last country that declared war on us was the one depicted in the Mouse that Roared (was this the title of a movie decades ago?) and it achieved what it was looking for: kind of Marshall plan financed by us. In other words, the whole issue is a joke.

In fact, only illegal immigrants are , not legal. We filed the paperwork, paid for the fees , waited years for visa to be available, countless of trips to UCSIS , and U.S Consular. Years after years of waiting, we can now set foot on U.S head held high as legal immigrants. Meanwhile, illegal immigrants sneak into the U.S , anchor babies, expect to have benefits and free education without paying a penny. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Is is fair of legal immigrants like us ? Dear Mr Saavedra, have you ever been cut in line while you are lining up in a busy restaurant or theme park? That's the same feeling of legal immigrants toward illegal immigrants and freeloaders like you.

Even in the Deep South, less than 4% of the population owned a slave. And, history shows that amongst the Southern slave owners were Blacks and African Americans. When one considers that most of the wealth generated by the industrial revolution occurred in the slave free North, it's hard to agree with the author's statement that ""...much of the wealth enjoyed by"" the US was gained through the slave trade. Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US. It would make as much sense for African Americans to seek reparations from the West African kingdoms that captured the slaves and sold them to European slavers."
587;9628;kids;1;1;to be a good parent teacher person father in control;the intention of the tweet towards 'kids' is to criticize and mock the conservative approach to education, particularly in regards to evolution, and to suggest that this approach will ultimately harm their career prospects in science.;The more you cut out of your child's curriculum, the bigger the educational and career advantages;Conservatives make me laugh when they struggle to keep their kids from learning evolution. What they're going to end up doing is keeping their children from having careers in science. Since I'm a liberal, that doesn't sound too bad to me. It keeps the competition down. People who don't accept evolution don't belong in science anyways. The more you cut out of your child's curriculum, the bigger the educational and career advantages you're handing to those kids whose parents aren't as nearly controlling and obsessive and ideologically blinkered as you are. So there is a free market solution to this problem. Maybe the Cato Institute should study that angle before they issue their next statement on the topic.

The wives form an integral part of the content-free agenda. It's a media riot, the conventions provide fodder for the media. It's a waste of time to actually watch the stuff live- better to time shift and read the views of the pundits at my convenience, rather than staying up late, or missing some good TV shows.

In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program.

And yes, medication. Many are only minimally helped, some not at all, but also many are rendered completely symptom free by medications. The brain, ill or not, is mysterious, but the suffering that can dwell there can be profound. Yes, give me Prozac for the patients it will help, and all the newest over-hyped meds like Viibryd and Brintellix as well, and whatever else can be concocted. Let the doubters come sit with me for one day face to face with the darkness.

I am sure they won't be ignoring the kids, but I am equally sure they won't be overwhelmed by the day-to-day, sometimes hour-by-hour, pressures of parenting either. Royal or not, there are too many billions between the Windors and the average family.

How much wildlife is left in Japan and the Netherlands? Doesn't the rest of creation matter? As for Africa and the Middle East--the disaster is just beginning.

Most of the time this is unreasonable and reflects prior, dare I say perverse, reluctance to try something that might help. So, to quote Paul Simon, a man (woman) hears what he (she) wants to hear and disregards the rest. So I spend extra time explaining myself, which gets tiresome.

There isn't a day;I live and work near Muir Woods. There isn't a day without smog hovering over the area. The neighborhood does not suffer density issues and there are no manufacturing facilities anywhere near the whole region. Yet, the smog in all its reddish-purple-haziness never flags. It comes out of the west from China. Over one billion people manufacture the good that seven billion of us need and it is killing us with polluted air, water and as an unsafe food source. All of this damage is done in the name of a single word: profit. It's time that we redefine that word or we will certainly die out as a specie.

Notice, I said factual information. It is sad in our world today when the supporters of finding real information, librarians, have been systematically cut from school budgets. Many librarians have crossed the bridge to finding legitimate information in the digital world as well as printed materials. Only, now that we need verification of information, do we find a shortage of personnel who can teach that skill.

Why shouldn't they have something constructive to say about education;Wait a minute: Don't very wealthy, un-elected people have huge power in every political area of influence in our culture. They have the success to show the way. We look up to them. Why shouldn't they have something constructive to say about education. I feel that traditionally trained teachers are chosen from the least talented pool of students. Their SAT and GRE scores are consistently in the bottom third. We need a bunch from the top third and the middle third, and we need huge improvement in MATH & SCIENCE. We do not need a bunch of obstructive, complacent union drones clogging up the arteries of education. We need more flexible educational leadership, and more rewards for excellent teachers.
598;6254;miss america;1;0;to make a point be fair inclusive understood;criticize the objectification of women in pageants, specifically miss america.;Why is it that the contestants in these pageants are women not men?;"Question: Why is it that the contestants in these pageants are women not men? Answer: Because it's women who are judge primarily for their beauty. Stop dehumanizing women! Judge a woman as you judge a man- ""for the content of their character."" (hummm..rings familar; where did I hear similar words before?). Judge them for their kindness, intelligence, talent, strength, creativity... Test: Don't mention a woman's physical attributes if you would not feel compelled to mention the man's physical attributes in the same context."
599;4854;eu passport;1;1;to be a part of something family bigger able travel;advantages of having an eu passport for the author's children.;producing that EU passport at the dreaded Heathrow Airport a couple of weeks;I hold dual citizenship as do two of my three American born children. One has a UK issued EU passport and the other an Irish one. Advantages ? Absolutely, not only for them but also for their children. And as for my motive in taking out US citizenship after 37 years here on a green card - very simple. I was trapped in Europe 9/11 and had an overwhelming need to go home, home being the US. That singular event and ensuing xenophobia clarified for me that the US was indeed my home, that I wanted to vote. On a lighter note, producing that EU passport at the dreaded Heathrow Airport a couple of weeks ago smoothed passage through that bottleneck! For my children, my dream is that they retain a link to their heritage from both sides of the pond, that they are citizens of the world, good ones at that.
600;1721;childbirth;1;1;to have a healthy baby pregnancy be good mother birth parent;the intention of the tweet is to promote home births as a better option than hospital births.;My home birth was by far the best decision I have ever made. The experience is almost in;This is a wonderful article. I have had 3 births, the first 2 were in the hospital, and my 3rd was at home. I had awful experiences in the hospital with feeling like my freedom was taken away. I felt like I was shackled to the bed from the moment I walked in. My home birth was by far the best decision I have ever made. The experience is almost indescribable. Don't get me wrong, my first 2 births are special to me only because it was the moment my beautiful children came into this world. I just wish I knew then what I know now. With my home birth, I had an absolutely wonderful midwife who monitored me, but also aloud me to have control and let my body do what it was meant to do: give birth. Pregnancy is not a sickness, and I refuse to allow it to be treated as such.
601;9678;palestinian cause;1;0;to get their way be treated fairly a leader free. free;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration and hopelessness towards the palestinian cause, and to suggest that violence may be necessary to achieve recognition and independence.;If the Palestinian cause is ignored again after Israel slaughtered 2100 Palestinians in Gaza including;If the Palestinian cause is ignored again after Israel slaughtered 2100 Palestinians in Gaza including 500  kids among 75% civilians then there is no hope for negotiation. Because the Palestinians are not recognized by Israelis as being divinely created equal with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If America was treating Mexicans and Canadians the way Israel treats Palestinians then it should expect resistance and would deserve it. American revolutionaries used violence to gain their independence. Zionist Jews used violence to obtain their nation state.
602;11126;writing research papers;1;1;to teach the students be thorough;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of close attention from teachers in successfully teaching the research paper process and the need for interim reports and grading at each stage.;The research paper is integral to college work;"The research paper is integral to college work. It's the vehicle through which students are taught to gather and evaluate serious sources and THEN create a convincing argument or thesis to prove/demonstrate. But, teaching the process successfully requires close attention from the teacher. In teaching, I set up the process by requiring interim reports at each stage: bibliography, creation of the thesis; first draft, finished draft. At each stage, I graded and criticized. Obviously, most institutions do not afford the amount of time this takes so the process gets mangled. And most English professors avoid teaching freshman English/comp so the course does not get the senior attention it deserves. A pity, because the research paper is key in teaching the student how to do college work and how to write serious papers."
603;1829;in-state students;1;1;to be a leader in control charge free;the intention of the tweet towards in-state students is to express frustration and disappointment that the university has a history of favoring out-of-state and foreign students over in-state students, who pay less tuition.;they wanted out of state and foreign students because they paid more;YES! They always have and always will ... until our government restricts the practice. I was told by a CA University professor they wanted out of state and foreign students because they paid more ... and that was 1978. DJM
604;977;bail out;1;0;to make money. get rich. be the best leader boss;the intention of the tweet towards target 'bail out' is to criticize and oppose it.;Of course this will always end with the US taxpayer baling them out and financing hideously large;It should be clear by now that, given enough slack in their leash, the banks will take the path of highest leverage without concern for risk. Look at how they all copied Countrywide Financial so they could get a larger share of feed at the trough. Of course this will always end with the US taxpayer baling them out and financing hideously large bonuses to those that risked everyone else's money and lost. We desperately need the Glass Steagall wall between deposits and investments. It would also be a big help if we implement a method to lower income inequality so that unsustainable amounts of personal debt are required to prop up our economy. Remember when Chairman Greenspan testified on TV in a Senate hearing and urged existing homeowners to tap into their equity? The rapid rise in personal debt in the form of credit card debt, mortgages and student loans is feeding these to-big-to fail financial behemoths that throw their weight around Washington.
605;3052;justice ginsberg;1;1;to be a leader make difference lawyer fair;the intention of the tweet towards justice ginsberg is to express agreement with her thoughts on merrick garland and her right to free speech.;Justice Ginsberg has the right of free speech also. That's the first thing I;Justice Ginsberg has the right of free speech also. That's the first thing I thought. Her thoughts on Merrick Garland were very appropriate. The Senate refusing to have a confirmation hearing under the Obama administration is an outrage. More than that, not having Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court is a wasted opportunity for our country. If you are acquainted with the legal system, you can appreciate the years of hard work Judge Garland has put in honing his redoubtable intellect. In addition, he has already provided a lifetime of public service. He richly deserves to be on the Supreme Court. The United States would be a better place. Professor Chemerinsky, you were so insightful during bar review, and you are right on target here.
606;4410;medical websites;1;1;to know what do is wrong the truth be informed;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to criticize the lack of trustworthiness and reliability of some medical websites, while also acknowledging the benefits of others.;I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call;I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies.
607;16771;volunteerism;1;0;to be the best make a point leader comparison;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the comparison of tfa volunteers to army recruits, arguing that teaching is less difficult than military training.;TFA suffers by comparison;Foote quotes someone who compares TFA volunteers to Army recruits. Even there, in fact, TFA suffers by comparison. Soldiers spend more time in basic training than the few weeks that TFA recruits do, let alone all the additional training specialists get. So what she's saying, effectively, is that the message of TFA is that teaching is less difficult than learning to march, obey orders and fire a gun.
608;15938;motherhood;1;1;to be a good parent take care of his needs their family son parent.;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the notion that older mothers lack energy and to promote the importance of self-care in maintaining energy levels.;I spend more time with my son than most of the younger mothers in my neighborhood do with their;All this talk of not having enough energy when you're older is nonsense. I had my son at 36 and am now 48. I have just as much energy as I did when I was 25. If you take care of yourself, energy shouldn't be a problem. Frankly, I spend more time with my son than most of the younger mothers in my neighborhood do with their kids. My husband and I aren't as eager to leave him with a babysitter so we can go out at night -- because we did that already in our twenties. In our forties, we are focused on our family.
609;14361;schoold;1;1;to learn more be productive prepared;the author's intention towards'schoold' is to argue for an extension of the school day to provide more time for teachers to teach and less homework for students, leading to improved sleep and overall well-being.;I love school and I love learning;I'm in my Junior year in High School, and I take the hardest courses my school offers. I average 8 hours of homework every night with 6-7 hours of school in a day. I also work about 3 hours a day. I do not sleep. I spend most of my weekend sleeping, until Sunday where I do 12 hours of homework. I love school and I love learning, and I'd argue the school day needs to be extended. The teachers do not have enough time to teach us all we need to know, especially in AP courses. Thus, we have an incredible amount of homework, depriving us of sleep, and leading to the negative consequences Ms. Carskadon warns. So, as long as teachers have more time to teach while at the same time giving less homework, I'm all for extending the school day.
610;662;sex industry;1;1;to be in control charge make money. power;the intention of the tweet towards the target'sex industry' is to argue that violence is inherent in the sex industry due to its history of illegality and criminal backgrounds of early entrants, but it will become less violent over time as it becomes more legal and regulated.;Violence is inherent in the sex industry;"Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways)."
611;20115;rich politicans;1;2;to get a job make money. money be independent;the intention of the tweet towards target 'rich politicans' is to criticize their policies and actions towards immigrants and black workers.;i'm against rich politicans;No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights.
612;16269;medical websites;1;1;to be healthy feel better get healthier;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to express gratitude for the valuable information found online about the author's autoimmune illness, which helped them improve their health and well-being.;I have learned some valuable things on the Internet;My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet.

He works full time at a steady job. He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!!

How many countries have politicians as stupid as Ted Cruz who advocates carpet bombing a population? Only the U.S. and Israel tolerate such barbarians, and then have mass media such as the NYT commissioned articles to denigrate other nations."
616;10485;parent;1;0;to be understood helpful help them learn;the author, jean clelland-morin, expresses concern about the negative impact of criticism and lack of understanding in education and parenting, advocating for empathetic listening and communication to support young people's emotional well-being.;We isolate our children when they are suffering and we make them into monsters;I'm 73. I wanted to be a perfect mother. Did I make mistakes? Let me count the ways. Still, I love my children for whom they are. / But here's one thing I know: If you are not a good LISTENER and you don't ask the right questions, you are making a major mistake. / We all go through periods of difficulty. If we can find a way to express our frustrations, we can work things out. But, if the educators are into criticism and humiliation as a learning-motivation and the parents are in the same mode, where does a young person go to communicate?

618;11318;immigration;1;0;to make more money get a job earn;the intention of the tweet is to argue that immigrants take jobs away from younger, less educated american citizens and rely on government assistance to make ends meet.;immigrants take jobs away from younger less educated american citizens;Of course, immigrants take jobs away from younger less educated american citizens. Immigrants work for lower wages, and rely on government assistance to pay their bills. A majority of immigrant families rely on gov assistance. 75& go hispanic immigrant families receive gov assistance. the immigrant families can't make ends meet without gov assistance. Their wages are just their secondary source of income. The young american citizens can't live on the lower wages, so they stop applying for the low wage jobs. Heres an example, sheet rock work in home construction, which used to be done by black contractors and laborers, is now done exclusively by spanish speakers in my town. Those jobs paid well in the past, but real wages have dropped, lately
619;9704;home schooling;1;0;to be independent independent. avoid the community alone;the intention of this tweet is to express the opinion that home schoolers intentionally distance themselves from the community, and suggest that if they want to partake in community benefits, they should not seek separation.;It seems to me home schoolers willfully separate themselves from the community to a certain degree;It seems to me home schoolers willfully separate themselves from the community to a certain degree. If they wanted to benefit from the community, such as participating in public school student activities, then maybe they shouldn't be trying to remain separate from it.
620;3714;tfa;1;0;to get a better job new out of school be good teacher;criticize tfa program for its design flaw and negative impact on education.;The program promises more than it can deliver;Many TFA folks are feeling defensive these days, and rightly so. The program promises more than it can deliver. It is not the fault of these idealistic and/or ambitious young people that the program has been overly touted as the silver bullet for all education's problems. There is nothing wrong with leaving education after two years, becoming an administrator or going to law school. The problem is that attrition is basically a design feature of the program. An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns. There needs to be an overhaul if the public is to be expected to continue supporting a program that is not successful in helping create long term stability in schools.
621;1979;tax;1;0;to be a good citizen get education better job person;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tax' is to argue against a tax break for home-schoolers.;we should not give home-schoolers a tax break;The reason that we should not give home-schoolers a tax break is simply that the education of our youth is the civic responsibility of the entire adult population. Period. If some people choose not to use the publicly funded system then they are free to do so but that does not exempt them from contributing to the freely available public system.
622;21344;extreme parenting;1;2;to get a raise earn more money be paid make;the user critiques len penzo's argument, suggesting that without tips, servers could still choose to provide excellent service, aligning waitstaff treatment with other service occupations and giving managers more flexibility in rewarding better workers.;This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers;Len Penzo writes, 'Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?' This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers.

These people have lost touch with the reality of the rest of us in a way comparable to that of any aristocracy in human history. And just like people stood up to the aristocracy in the great European revolutions of the 17th and 18th century, so we have to stand up to the new aristocracy in the 21st. We have to start somewhere - why not with ignoring these fat cat attempts to block our beach access with armed guards.
624;16749;big banks;1;0;to make money get rich lose;criticizes the power and influence of big banks on the economy and society.;Investors are gamblers;I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck.
625;12115;off shore manufacturing;1;0;to be in control make money. money get ahead;criticize off shore manufacturing for being hypocritical.;How ironic in which for decades now companies have been moving their manufacturing to low wage off shore;How ironic in which for decades now companies have been moving their manufacturing to low wage off shore locations to boost their profits yet they feel it necessary to attempt to legally inhibit an employee from moving on to a a better opportunity with another organization? Quite laughable when you think China, in particular, has paid little attention to patent rights and intellectual property, let alone their ongoing attempted hacking of American corporate secrets, yet, these companies remain there. If a company insisted on me signing such a questionable agreement, it is time to look elsewhere. The hypocrisy here is beyond the pale.

The administration has already told your colleagues how much it values their input; you echo that message when you write ""whether we like it or not."""
627;10095;political opinions;1;1;to be heard honest help justice;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the lack of action by judges in the 1930s to oppose fascist politicians and leaders, and to urge judges in the 21st century to take a stand against the attack on the rule of law.;If only judges in the 1930s had loudly spoken out against fascist politicians and leaders;If only judges in the 1930s had loudly spoken out against fascist politicians and leaders.

Today this small city and its architectural treasures is an international destination for those interested in architecture. Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli. Obviously, none were local.
629;21172;jail record;1;2;to be a leader respected respectful understood;the author expresses frustration with arab muslims and european regimes' handling of middle east conflicts, advocating for respect of sovereign rights and criticizing bargohouti and the nyt.;The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles;The usual tripe and nonsense from an apologist for the Arab Terror Method of Political Engagement. When the adults amongst us see arab muslims grant and respect the sovereign rights of others in the middle east, including the kurds, yazidis, azeri, bahai, cop tics, maronites, chaldeans, maneachans, and jews, THEN I might begin to believe that the relentless, mindless commitment to war and violence by arab muslims against all others might be ceased, and there might be peace achieved in the mideast. The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles away from the nearest hostile arab muslim-majority state affirm the general lack of respect that should be granted to the European perspective. Their dictates as to how Israel should be treating a population whose majority supports terrorism against it are wholly meaningless. Bargohouti of course offers the usual bile about Israel and a 2-state solution, and then exposes himself as nothing but a despicable liar by demanding that millions of arab muslims be allowed to move into Israel, despite have no legal foundation to do so. The NYT can do better.
630;20393;illegal immigration;1;2;to be environmentally friendly get somewhere quickly have a car save money;the user expresses a preference for cars powered by natural gas over electric cars, critiquing the environmental impact and cost-effectiveness of electric cars, particularly those powered by coal.;I would much prefer a car powered with natural gas;I love to hike and climb. My hiking boots and climbing gear has to be good for 10 out of 10 situations. My car needs to be good for 10 our of 10 senarios. I would much prefer a car powered with natural gas. Drove a natual gas car all around Argentina. It had power, got me to where I needed to go, the natural gas was much cheaper than gas. Electric cars in the USA will be 65% powered by coal. What sense does that make? The wind and solar argument is only rational if we are willing to be irrational and spend hundreds of billions in government grants (yes outright grants) to make the industry viable. So I guess if you live in a place like NY City and drive very little such a car makes might make sense. Then I guess you just have to agree with coal powered elecrtric plants! I can see a whole bunch of environmental yahoos screwing their own philosophy just to be cool buying an electric car!
631;19691;lack support white middle class student;1;2;to be helpful help people others students;the intention of the tweet is to address the issue of lack of support for white middle class students in public education, specifically in the context of media centers and their role in providing valuable resources and teaching skills.;a library can't exist on its own;I am a retired HS media specialist and I am still asked all the time to help people find things on the Internet. My HS age granddaughter needs help evaluating reference material. Example: Why not depend on Wikipedia only? Libraries and the Internet work together and a library can't exist on its own. Without a person in the facility to keep it going and to teach students its value, it will die. Teacher or media specialist is not the issue. We need to support public education fully. That means teachers, the arts, sports, and the Media Center.

Thankfully, most other services in this world are one-price to the customer. It's left to the employer to do the work of assessing whether the employee is providing good service."
633;9043;control;1;1;to make money get rich save;"the intention of the tweet towards target 'control' is to criticize the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation in large banks, and to call for reforms to free capital from these ""casino operators"" and redirect it towards more productive uses.";direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation;Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips.

Tufts has managed more football losing seasons than I care to think about. MIT has more sports teams than any other university, I am led to believe. (Except football). They both exercised my grey cells. I thought that was what college was all about.

Facebook is a democratization of the news in the sense that you can find stories and opinions that the corporate media are too afraid or intimidated or just plain arrogantly refusing to cover. Bernie Sanders is just one example NYT. Please wake up and do the right thing before you become irrelevant.
636;21486;big bank;1;2;to be helpful help others people feel better;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'big bank' is to criticize and question the actions of a person who was previously perceived as a saint for helping the poor and ill, but now appears to have not provided the help thought to be given.;I was under the impression she helped people who were suffering because they were ill and unable;I am confused. I was under the impression she helped people who were suffering because they were ill and unable to help themselves because they were poor. I thought she fed them and provided help to cure their illnesses. Now it seems to me from these articles that she did not provide the help I thought she had. If this is true than she is no Saint.
637;10356;european refugee admission;1;0;to make a point be in control hero helpful;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the admission of non-syrian refugees in europe.;none of the people appearing in Europe and demanding asylum are refugees;Seems a bit silly, perhaps tongue in cheek. How to force people to fight who don't want to fight? Bottom line is that none of the people appearing in Europe and demanding asylum are refugees, since the Syrians all had places of refuge (Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.) and left those places of refuge as economic migrants (preferring German welfare to Turkish welfare, as would any rational human being). As for the non-Syrians, including various draft dodgers, they were not even refugees to start with.

Shaw may be on to something here. One of the things I have noticed while traveling and living abroad is how much better the service is in countries where there is no tipping (China) or where the tip is automatically added to the check (much of Europe). As counter-intuitive as it seems, I have come to the conclusion that tipping is actually a disincentive to good service but could never develop any notions as to why that might be.

Mom didn't take the time to educate the kids, girls and boys alike, on how to cook and the schools have done away with Home Economics classes for science and math classes thinking this will better America. Over the last 40 years the ease of outside food access into the home outweighs the time of cooking in the home and getting everyone fed and into bed for the night. The ability for people to slow down and have family time, and moreover people want and know how to use family time, will be the obesiety epidemic end and will solve so many more problems than just America being fat.

There is open, honest competition between banks for the customer's business, for one thing: not apparent collusion between major banks to charge similar fees and stifle true competition!! I pay $8.5 per month, get free debit services, free checking, 10 ATM transactions per month, and my overdraft fees are only $5 per shot (thank goodness, lol!!). Most ATMs charge $1.5 for transactions not associated with their sponsoring banks and even the private ones only ask this much. I remember visiting the USA in 1998 and simply refusing to pay $3 just to use an ATM!!!! The USA is the richest country on the planet, with the hugest bank profits... looks like exploiting the poor and vulnerable in their society is one of the ways they GOT so rich in the first place.

Make labor income taxes very low and capital gains very high. No one has ever talked about this. Maybe because it would never work? I really don't know but would be curious to learn.

On paper both looked good, and they seemed to know their stuff in the interviews. But both were extremely difficult for other staff to work with, because they were ultimately incapable of seeing other people's viewpoints. One of them literally threw crying hissy fits when she didn't get her way. Now New Hampshire is allowing this kind of head in the sand ""la-la-la, not listening, you're view doesn't exist"" kind of behavior in the public schools? Remind me to avoid their job applicants. I don't have time to deal with employees who think they have a right to their own facts. Bottom line: you are welcome to give your child a narrow, even bizarre, education if you choose. Just don't ask me to pay for it, or to hire your kid."

I could go to New York City and buy a fifth of Bourbon from a package store. If I take that bottle back to my hotel room and drink it, do I get to blame my hangover it on New York's overly permissive alcohol laws? Does there need to be a warning on every bottle of Bourbon telling me what the proper dose is, and not to drink too much or risk a hangover? What is it about marijuana that makes aging squares like Dowd crazy? The only real reason marijuana is still a federal crime is simple pig-headedness.

I could accept being nickel and dimed if the executive salaries were brought down to acceptable levels (i.e., maximum $500 000 for the CEO).

ISIS might not yet be the existential threat posed by the Axis powers but it is heading that way. Point being that we should do whatever is necessary short of WMD to defeat this evil. Even if it means cooperating with Assad whose regime, while brutal, poses no threat to the US.

Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds.

I didn't use the police's services this year - I should get a tax break! I didn't use the fire department this year - I should get a tax break! I didn't fly anywhere this year - I should get tax breaks, locally for not using our airport, and federally, for not using the air traffic control and navigation systems. Pretty foolish to believe that, not making using of a community resource should exempt us from having to contribute to the community. We are still a community, aren't we?? Well, aren't we?? Kind of makes me wonder.
651;13430;high school football;1;0;to get a good education be student better grade job;the author's intention is to express frustration with the public education system's lack of flexibility in course selection, and propose separating school sports from academic institutions.;a lot of the folks who are gung ho on their local high school football and basketball;My daughter would LOVE to be able to opt in and out of classes at the Virginia public high school she attends. Personally, I would LOVE to be able to pull her out of certain classes and get her tutored in them or some such. But that's now how it works. If her high school is not good enough for these kids to attend, then they have no business being there playing sports. It is not a cafeteria, you don't get to pick and choose what you do and do take off the tray. Why don't we just take team sports out of the schools and make them a separate institution? Certainly a lot of the folks who are gung ho on their local high school football and basketball programs don't give much of a damn about the academics of those students anyway so long as they can have a winning team. Let's set up something elsewhere and let the rest of our kids concentrate on getting an education that will enable them to do something besides playing sports!

Adults are required to attend a polling station, to produce identification, and to have their name crossed off the electoral roll. They are then handed voting slips but there is no requirement to fill them out or submit them, or to submit a valid vote. This system ensures that no-one is forced to vote if they do not wish to, but also ensures that the barriers to participation are removed. It embodies the Australian ethos of ""a fair go for all"". Sadly I don't think the system used here in the USA is worthy of its citizens."

I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension.

""Seems""? I don't recall people twenty years ago saying that the cure for unwanted pregnancy was to ban contraception. Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our ""smart bombs"" and ""smart phones"" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves ""by accident"" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago. I seriously doubt that even the average person's knowledge of basic geography is better today than that of my grandparents."

It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.

As commenter RC pointed out - many workplaces are abusive. There will always be employers who exploit workers no matter what kind of work. You don't respond to exploitation by making the work illegal. It's right up there with people who can't tell the difference between sex slavery and sex work. Sex slavery is horrible - not because it's sex but because it's slavery. But many people, including well-meaning people can't make the distinction because anything to do with sex just throws them into a riot of emotion and they can't calmly and dispassionately distinguish between non-exploitive freely chosen sex-work and exploitation and slavery. And anybody who tries to do look at the issue rationally is branded as naive at best and cold-hearted and colluding with sex traffickers at worst.

It would be an ideal time to study opioid medication. But understanding that should not be where the study ends. Medication errors are not a problem just with one class like an opioid. To instruct students to use this for one problem and another for the next problem is inadequate training. They should be taught and know that every medication carries some baggage that can cause problems, even two aspirins

One of the things my sisters and I learned at Sweet Briar is how to use our voice. How to speak up and be confident.

It was an education class that was about 2/3 women. Guess who did 75% of the talking? Guess whose opinion was validated by the professor and the TAs? Not the majority. Single-sex education (yes, I think men should have the single-sex opportunity too) may not be for everyone, but to argue that it is not a beneficial learning environment is uninformed and ignorant.

And those students also do well on the entrance exam. Of course, those are students who did well in college course exams. And good college test-takers did well on the SAT. So why not just go straight from the SAT to practicing law? Fact is, the reality of the bar exam is a powerful motivation to actually learn the material. There's merit in making freshly minted JDs do that. Just because we know certain students will do well on the exam, shouldn't excuse them from doing the work.

There is a correlation between our high unemployment rate and outsourcing. Off-shoring is the appropriate word but when you are one of the millions whose job is gone, off-shoring and outsourcing mean the same thing: no job. The biggest fear now is that when Tea Partiers and Republicans finish taking the government apart with the rataionale of getting spending under control, unemployment may be higher. Because outsourcing has the mantra of cheapest and lowest cost, our neighbors and children pay the cost. The wages paid in India, China, Brazil are not enough to support American lifestyles, communities and housing. Having seen the devastation that outsourcing has done to communities I've traveled to, I no longer support it. The devastating cost has long outweighed the benefits.

Why he can't protest against fan;Well, that guy just burned a bunch of paper... Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims? Those who punished him are just getting upset for nothing. Can the burning of a Bible or a Koran means war? this is stupid. People must learn to not get upset for things like that. To convince about God, please don't use terrorism or bullying... use love, reasoning, and wisdom
674;5166;education funding;1;0;to be a good citizen help the poor person get money;the intention of the tweet is to express support for the state lottery as a potential source of funding for education, while also expressing skepticism about the reliability of promised yields.;This is deja vu all over again;"When I was a student at Queens College and plans for the first State Lottery were announced, $360 million yearly was the magic number tossed about that would go towards education; many of us there supported the proposition. Prof. Marilyn Gittel posed a rhetorical question ...will the money be in addition to existing funds, or will those funds be reduced by the Lottery revenue? We know the answer to that one, and we also know that promised yields never seem to show up. This is deja vu all over again."
675;17300;home school tax credits;1;0;to be independent independent. save money free;criticizes home school tax credits.;If parents who home school their children are entitled to a tax credit, then what about child;That's hooey. If parents who home school their children are entitled to a tax credit, then what about childless taxpayers who have to pay for public schools? Why shouldn't they receive a refund of the part of property taxes which goes toward local public schools, since they have neither contributed to the costs of operating those schools or derived benefits from them? Both private and home schooling are voluntary, and hence it is a choice that parents make to eschew the public school paid for by their taxes. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay the additional amount for their decisions. If so, then childless taxpayers are entitled to similar benefits.
676;5413;work;1;2;to work in a quiet place environment be private room;the intention of the tweet towards target 'work' is to suggest that private spaces are better for jobs that require thought and concentration, and that uncontrolled collaboration isn't always beneficial.;any job that requires thought and/or concentration is better done in a private space;Having worked and managed people in both environments, its clear to me that any job that requires thought and/or concentration is better done in a private space. It can even be hard to focus in cubicles, but they are certainly better than an open floor. Uncontrolled collaboration isn't always beneficial. That's what team meeting (formal or informal) are for.

678;3285;helping condo developers;1;0;to get a better deal rid of something taxes make point;the intention of the tweet is to help condo developers by advocating for the benefits of the 421-a program and the economic activity it generates.;Every time a building is constructed it creates a HUGE amount of tax revenue AND;"I fail to see how its possible that a derelict site replaced by a building that pays double to triple the existing taxes at the beginning of the 421-a abatement....and then escalates over the next 10 years to much, much more.....and continues to pay FAR HIGHER real estate taxes forever once the abatement is expires.....doesn't benefit EVERYONE. Something is horribly wrong with this politically motivated mathematics. Everyone is outraged by the 421-a program at 157 West 57th Street and one could argue that its not fair that the ""rich people' are getting this tax break: the opponents and critics never mention that on a $50 million apartment sale over $1.4 MILLION in transfer and mansion taxes are paid. If a building like this was not constructed, where exactly would the city generate these tax dollars from? What about this $ 1.4million in taxes collected from the sale alone doesn't benefit the public? What is government doing with the MASSIVE taxes they are collecting from these sales? Every time a building is constructed it creates a HUGE amount of tax revenue AND economic activity: why no mention of this? Barika, please tell the full story."
679;12345;everyone;1;0;to be healthy healthy. avoid getting sick healthier;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the individuality of dietary needs and the importance of considering personal factors when making dietary choices.;we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what;I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.
680;10882;healthier;1;1;to be healthy help others people;the intention of the tweet is to promote a healthier lifestyle through education and continuous messaging.;The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese;"The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, ""Don't you love your kids?"" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept."
681;13527;mine;1;0;to make more money money. earn;the intention of the tweet towards target'mine' is to criticize the job and its conditions, but also acknowledge that it is attractive due to its high wages.;Mining is also an intolerable job;Mining is also an intolerable job, but people do it because they are paid much more than they could make at any other available job, I believe about $60K/year which is good money in the poor parts of the country. LOTS of jobs are difficult and/or dangerous but they pay enough to attract people, at least people who don't readily have better options. This is STRICTLY a matter of wages. For $60K/year, I betcha lots of people would learn to pick vegetables and fruit.
682;1607;pilots remuneration;1;1;to be a good employee worker get job better;the intention of the tweet towards target 'pilots remuneration' is to express concern about the mistreatment and underpayment of pilots.;we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots;Personally I think airlines don't care about any of their workers. They most certainly don't care about the flying public/customer. This is reflected in the faces of all who are shoehorned and buckled into tiny seats. Like all other jobs today we humans are disposable workers, flight attendants included. I can handle a surly or neglectful attendant on occasion for it is a tough, demanding position but we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots. This worries me tremendously having worked for the airlines in the past. These mostly highly trained professionals are being abused and not paid decently. Don't get me wrong cabin crews are important but the person in the cockpit can not be marginalized or treated poorly. I think we can all agree that safe, happy and well rested and trained pilots are crucial to the business.
683;14173;closing borders;1;1;to be in control protect his country safe safe.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'closing borders' is to advocate for strict border control and a reduction in refugee intake.;The borders must be closed;The borders must be closed. PEople should be stopped from going there and coming from there or pretending to. Refugee intake must be radically reduced. We are playing with fire people. Europe will fall apart if this flood of angry people continues. The right will rise up. Europeans are seeing their cities destroyed.

If I have to keep;A cat living in the wild needs its claws for climbing trees and for self defense. A pet cat kept indoors does not need its claws. If I have to keep a pet cat I would insist on declawing it. Otherwise I would forgo the pleasure of having a cat as a pet, no matter how cuddly.
685;8350;home schoolers;1;1;to educate their children his teach child be responsible;the intention of the tweet towards target 'home schoolers' is to criticize the idea of providing financial incentives for home schooling, as it undermines the public education system.;Rewarding this decision with financial incentives is not rational when there is a public option;As parents we moved to districts that had excellent public schools. Additionally we spent hours teaching our children to broaden their intellect, encourage their curiousity, and ensure their mastery of subjects. Just as our parents had done with us. We don't expect a tax credit for taking responsibility to educate our children. If citizens want to home school their children, then it is their choice. Rewarding this decision with financial incentives is not rational when there is a public option. If parents don't like the public education they have two choices, move to a better district or work hard to improve their local schools.
686;2057;irls are constantly judged on their physical appearances;1;0;to be noticed attractive admired accepted;the intention of the tweet is to express that physical appearance is not the only factor that defines a person's worth and self-esteem, and that it is not the reason for loving oneself or being proud of one's identity.;it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth;Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me.
687;21388;food cabling;1;2;to have a child be parent raise family;the author expresses support for individual choices on parenting timing, but personally advocates for having children in one's late twenties, based on personal experience and potential benefits for both the parent and the child.;I agree with many of the posters: there is no one 'right' decision about the;I agree with many of the posters: there is no one 'right' decision about the timing of parenting. That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around.
688;8998;environment;1;1;to be healthy healthier eat live longer;"the intention of the tweet towards the target 'environment' is to express disappointment that the ""room for debate"" essays did not discuss the environmental benefits of veganism.";There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan;"I was disappointed to read the ""Room for Debate"" essays published April 17 addressing ""Is Veganism Good for Everyone."" Of the six essayists, only two appear to be vegans, and not one is a physician or nutritionist. There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition. But one thing I do understand is that I have been vegan for 20 years and I have never been healthier."

I don't think calling the Michigan affirmative action practices ""a justified remedy"" allows any entity to violate that amendment, particularly since its public has gone on record as rejecting it. Who says its a ""justified remedy"" and what are the qualifications of the entity making that claim? This is an argument from a law professor?"

On paper both looked good, and they seemed to know their stuff in the interviews. But both were extremely difficult for other staff to work with, because they were ultimately incapable of seeing other people's viewpoints. One of them literally threw crying hissy fits when she didn't get her way. Now New Hampshire is allowing this kind of head in the sand ""la-la-la, not listening, you're view doesn't exist"" kind of behavior in the public schools? Remind me to avoid their job applicants. I don't have time to deal with employees who think they have a right to their own facts. Bottom line: you are welcome to give your child a narrow, even bizarre, education if you choose. Just don't ask me to pay for it, or to hire your kid."
691;11372;research on electric cars;1;1;to save money the environment money. planet;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the lack of accurate information and research on electric cars.;Some of these readers need to research about what they believe about electric cars;I should not be surprised at the high level of naive, inaccurate and incorrect comments. Some of these readers need to research about what they believe about electric cars. Some misconceptions are that batteries don't last that long (they do and are easily recyclable), biodiesel is a viable fuel source of trans fuel for the planet (will not hardly make a dent in demand), fuel cells technology is possible soon (long way off), environmentalists are responsible for keeping diesel cars out of the USA (VW is selling them and the EPA is responsible for clean air.) Electric costs will go up. (A larger percentage of charging will be in off-peak hours making power companies more efficient since they have to power up and down every night and incentives to build more efficient and alternative generation.) Or for no other reason, it's just plain stupid to make an electric car. (Don't buy one then.)
692;5958;a tax break;1;1;to be a good parent have education better educate their children children.;the intention of the tweet is to argue against a tax break for parents who have already paid to send their children to school, suggesting that they should instead use the money to fund schools and improve the quality of education.;why should these parents get a tax break? Why don't they just use the money;Do seniors who have already paid to send their children to school also deserve a tax break? Homeschooling children is a choice , sending children to private school is a choice. - why should these parents get a tax break? Why don't they just use the money to fund schools so that the highest quallity teachers would want to teach in them?

That tuition cap limits college spending to whatever the public is willing to invest. But it does not change the cost of college, or what institutions actually spend per student."" Yes it does... you can't spend more than you have, just a simple fact. Public education would likely be cheaper on a per student basis than the private version. Classes would be larger, dorms less nice, with less landscaping on the lawns. I don't think that's necessarily bad. I think the current system is actually the worst of all worlds - a loan and financial aid system that effectively allows colleges to charge each student the absolute maximum of what they're able to pay, with public subsidies helping increase the price further."
694;7174;racism;1;0;to be a good citizen person fair free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'racism' is to argue that the racial argument is a distraction from the real question of whether our right to vote should be linked to compliance to law.;The racial argument is a distraction;The racial argument is a distraction: relevant to the repudiation of other policies but not this one. The real question is whether our right to vote should be linked to compliance to law. I suggest that a due process argument applies. While criminals were sentenced under due process, the removal of voting rights was attached not by the court but by the legislature without reference to the particular case. If illegal action is thus punished, should we include traffic offenses? Late filing of taxes? Disenfranchisement seem an unusual and arbitrary punishment and is not handled by the judiciary to whom the constitution gave the authority in sentencing. Star Ship Troopers was a dreadful, great movie: but it held that the right to vote was earned by military service. In America, the right is not explicitly defined but I suggest that it is implicitly based on citizenship and felons remain citizens. You may not like that they can vote, but that should hold no greater weight that your dislike of that idiot down the street with all those dumb signs in his yard.

I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being.

Right on one count, wrong on the other. Hey, I know, let's lower the rim so everyone can dunk. Then it'll be even better, right?

Mom didn't take the time to educate the kids, girls and boys alike, on how to cook and the schools have done away with Home Economics classes for science and math classes thinking this will better America. Over the last 40 years the ease of outside food access into the home outweighs the time of cooking in the home and getting everyone fed and into bed for the night. The ability for people to slow down and have family time, and moreover people want and know how to use family time, will be the obesiety epidemic end and will solve so many more problems than just America being fat.

Also, when people get upset and afraid of things that can't really hurt them (like riding in an elevator) it is good for them to face their fears and see that nothing terrible happens. So what if one were to burn a Kindle that contained a copy of every religion's special literature? That way, maybe, we could all see that these relics are not where God's love lies; and destroy an insidious device in the bargain."

What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years.
705;4074;israel;1;0;to be in control a leader power helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'israel' is to criticize the u.s.'s perceived bias towards israel in the palestine-israel conflict.;the issue isn't Palestine v. Israel;Regardless of what other commenters think about Palestine and the Palestinians- some of it blatantly racist e.g. that Arabs are a violent people and therefore not worthy of U.S. support, some of it just historically ignorant- e.g. Arafat turned down a peace deal and therefore Palestinians are undeserving of a state forever after - the issue isn't Palestine v. Israel. The issue is whether the U.S. can be an impartial mediator in the dispute. And it cannot. The U.S., for better or for worse, wrongfully or rightfully, has a 'special relationship' with Israel that will always, always, always come first. Regardless of the current state of affairs, of who is on the 'wrong' or 'right' side of the latest iteration of the conflict, the U.S. is in Israel's corner first and the peace process's second. We therefore can never be a true mediator in this issue.

But enough's enough. Let people speak their minds. These are tough times; there's lot's to be upset about. Less repression and less what's essentially sanctimonious PR by the complainers might do us more good in the long run. The point of a right to free speech is precisely that some people's opinions about important things are bound to offend (i.e., really offend) some other people (and draw negative attention). So, we (the right thinking one's among us) are offended, uncomfortable, squirming; get over it."

If we want quick gains, go for diesel. Even that faces issues in the US: refinery capacity, a tax system that paradoxically leaves gasoline cheaper. Diesel engines are more expensive than gasoline engines, but it wouldn't take much of a subsidy to encourage users to switch -- just look at Europe, where in some countries diesel is the norm and gasoline the exception.

711;5725;crime;1;0;to make a point understand the situation problem something;the intention of the tweet towards target 'crime' is to argue that statistical models are acceptable for predicting criminality, as they first demonstrate a statistical association and then try to identify and construct a causal model.;Statistical correlation may not demonstrate causality, but it directs our attention to possible causal factors;Analogies are a weak form of argument, but the parallels in predicting medical outcomes and those used to predict criminality are inherently the same. In both instances the goal is predictive accuracy. Statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models are not inherently good or bad. A researcher may think that if one can predict medical or sociological outcomes, then one understands them, but that is not the case. Statistical correlation may not demonstrate causality, but it directs our attention to possible causal factors--such as the link between smoking and cancer. Thus the use of probability models in criminality studies is heuristic and acceptable. First, demonstrate a statistical association, and then try to identify and construct a causal model.
712;8928;prison;1;0;to be in charge make money. control money save;criticize privatization of prisons.;privatization there is profit and the overhead of having goverment agents doing the contracting and;If the function is a basic governmental function, the job surely can be done most economically with direct government supervision of the employees doing the job. With privatization there is profit and the overhead of having goverment agents doing the contracting and overseeing the contract. When the Ohio governor wants to sell publicly-owned prisons to private contractors and says that then they become profitable, it says to me that the governor's thinking is not working well. Who pays the bill to the private contractor? -- the government! Plus some profit, and the overhead of competing the contract and overseeing that the contract is being properly carried out!! Also, contracting out jobs opens the door for politicians giving the contracts to favorites. Civil service regulations prohibits some corruption with direct government employees.

The whole argument is a red herring. The bottom line: Our schools need all the help they can get.
714;2577;living conditions;1;1;to be a good person citizen example neighbor leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'living conditions' is to suggest that improving civility and enforcing minor offenses can positively impact living conditions in poorly policed areas.;In such areas the worst behaving people end up determining the living conditions of all;People who are in the habit of behaving with civility tend not to commit minor crimes and to not disrespect the lives of others. Police work that enforces minor offenses and quality of life ordinances sends the message that uncivil behavior will not be tolerated. Some in poorly policed areas are characterized by a lot of people who live in distress, are exposed to criminal behavior on a daily basis, and are exposed to significant numbers of people who are used to acting out without any consequences. In such areas the worst behaving people end up determining the living conditions of all.
715;12838;market for marijuana;1;0;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet towards the target'market for marijuana' is to criticize the relentless campaign of kevin sabet and his focus on incarceration, which helps maintain the markets of illegal drug cartels and causes harm to young people.;A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace;Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012.

More like they want PIECE: more land and more settlements. Unfortunately and sadly, the only thing that may lead to serious negotiations and some sort of peace agreement is economic and political pressure on Israel by western governments.

I could also go along with industry having a very important voice in the framing of regulations. But where, Mr Adams--where, pray tell, does it follow that ""businesses are...best equipped to regulate themselves?"" Your syllogism is lacking a critical premise."

Period. If some people choose not to use the publicly funded system then they are free to do so but that does not exempt them from contributing to the freely available public system.

In fact, to get a decent job. I understand we have multiple languages there but I would have never been able to find a job and do any international work without it. Now that I live in the US and work at a multinational company, it would be even better to know more languages like Spanish or French...so I applaud the colleges who recognize and require that.
720;20318;everyone;1;2;to get a job the tired;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the hiring practices of professional jobs that prioritize physical fitness over intellectual ability.;Regardless of their intellect or job experience, there was no chance of their being hired. Why;During my career as a college administrator I interviewed my fair share of obese job applicants for professional positions. Regardless of their intellect or job experience, there was no chance of their being hired. Why? Because they couldn't fit in the chairs at the conference table where search committees met. They sat on the edge of chairs and almost fell forward trying to balance, which didn't do much for their concentrating on complex question from faculty members. They were constantly out of breath, and sweating, and struggled to reach for the glass of water set before them. They could barely walk to various sites around campus for a required tour, and in some cases, wouldn't even try. They shuffled down the halls while their fit escorts waited, if not patiently, certainly politely. Faculty and other professional jobs require energy and stamina. No amount of intellect can overcome these kinds of self-induced problems, and discrimination is really irrelevant in such cases when one considers the terrible burden such people impose on employers.

It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world!
722;16503;rising ecological problems;1;0;to save the planet world be a leader in control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'rising ecological problems' is to highlight the negative impact of population growth on the environment and the need for a more sustainable approach to population control.;Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water;Laurie Mazur talks of women's rights being the key to population, a mantra embedded in the Rio Declaration of 1992. But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain. Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water shortages and no jobs? What is clear is that the world is not sustaining the thousands of refugees drowning in the Andaman Sea and Mediterranean Ocean escaping an unsustainable existence.

The other way some of them cherry pick is through their faux lotteries. At Success, the first round of the lottery uses a computer algorithm to choose kids; when those families decline or are found ineligible, Success doesn't have to blindly choose anymore - they can go into the 'wait list' pool and select the kids they think will have the fewest academic, behavioral, language, or special needs issues."
725;14740;ca farming mechanization;1;1;to be in charge control save money make;the author's intention towards target 'ca farming mechanization' is to express their opinion that the united farm workers' efforts to prevent mechanization in the late 70s/early 80s were successful in delaying the move towards mechanization, but their influence may no longer be strong enough to stop it in 2011.;In the late 70s/early 80s, the United Farm Workers did a lot;Or farming of this type would just move to mechanization to keep costs down. In the late 70s/early 80s, the United Farm Workers did a lot to prevent academic research into mechanization of California farming, and wanted the state to impose taxes on mechanized fruit and vegetable harvesters. I think their efforts even included a terrorist attack on the Ag-engineering department at UC-Davis (although maybe that's just something I just heard?). But it's 2011, and I doubt they are strong enough to stop mechanization these days.
726;2835;high school hours;1;0;to get out of school a better job good degree;the intention of the tweet towards target 'high school hours' is to criticize the long hours spent in high school and suggest that increasing them would lead to dropping out.;I basically hated high school and loved college. The primary difference was not having to spend so;Public school inevitably has a one-size-fits-all conundrum. I basically hated high school and loved college. The primary difference was not having to spend so many hours a day in class. I believe had my daily 7 hour high school imprisonment increased beyond its 8:30 to 3:30 schedule, I'd have gone from hating it to dropping out.

American Jews realize the;There is the real problem, American fundamentalist Christians, who believe this fantasy about God's promises. American Jews realize the contradiction in supporting a state with a religious bias while living in one they expect to be neutral, but the so-called Christians, who can find justifications for any atrocity , are more numerous and know so little about the world that they can be easily manipulated.

729;12010;crime;1;0;to be safe safe. protect the public helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'crime' is to criticize the police department's actions and suggest alternative solutions to address the issue.;It's morally wrong;Police departments have been doing this kind of thing all along. It's morally wrong. Intense supervision of dangerous areas is fine, as long as the cops don't aggravate their own fears and their hair trigger fingers. More educational and after-school programs are necessary. Kids need to have something safe to do while their parents are working. Why is that such a mystery to city governments?

The school provided him with the extra support he needed to help him learn how to manage and move forward. He's been in the program for 4 years now and ready to leave the program. He has learned and mastered the skills necessary to manage himself and his own work both in and out of school. He's not on any meds. He's never been on any meds. I refused to put him through any of that. And he's done very well. I'd say the school deserves the majority of the credit for where my son is today. We went from spending 4 hours of guided help on homework on a nightly basis to him doing his homework all on his own without any help and having it completed in 20-45 mins. And he's an honor roll student.

Never in our history has this counsel been ignored--until now. The Soviet Union's attempts to gain control of American foreign were inept and pathetic. Not Israel's. Israel has gained control the old-fashioned way, so perfectly personified by the grotesque Adelson: they simply BOUGHT our government outright.

Now and then I have the chance to give advice to the young, and mine always is to dive into marriage and family early. We had 3 kids by the time I graduated from college (on time, at 22). We had two more by 28. True, my wife delayed finishing college; she got her degree in 1975 at age 27 instead of 1970. My other advice to the young: don't decide how to live based on what professors, the magazines, and the newspapers say is the latest thing. It's your life, get cracking on it."
733;11111;capitalism;1;1;to be a leader in control fair independent;critical of capitalism.;The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in;It can be different elsewhere. The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in the worst aspects of market capitalism. In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life. Hands down.

I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that."
736;14952;emissions regulation;1;0;to get rid of regulation regulations be a good citizen person;the author's intention towards emissions regulation is to diminish its role and promote a small government agenda.;This scandal is proof that government regulation and testing is essential. Without it this fraud would never have;I haven't heard any serious call for more regulation of the emissions problem, All I hear is a call to make it harder for companies to cheat by improving testing of vehicles. This is not additional regulation. The author in using a massive cheating scandal to diminish the role of regulation is again promoting the small government agenda. This scandal is proof that government regulation and testing is essential. Without it this fraud would never have been detected.

Women therefore seek to compete. The same phenomenon can be observed in insects, birds, and other mammals. Displays of fitness vary, and in some it is the females rather than the males that make the displays. So -- what is wrong with it? The process is comfortably Darwinian and it has contributed to our success as a species. I don't see why political correctness should be allowed to get in the way of that -- not that, in reality, you could argue men out of their attraction to beautiful women anyway.

Why are newborns getting a Hepatitis B vaccine right out of the womb? There is zero reason for this unless the mother has Hep B. Yet every US child is to get this on day 0? And then 2 more? What on earth for? Bombarding a newborn's immune system with so many assaults so early is ridiculous and imo criminal. Why are more than 80% of the outbreaks occurring in vaccinated children? Is the vaccine even effective then? Aluminum (a neurotoxin) is added to many vaccines to purposefully inflame the immune system to react to the virus (called an adjuvent) and yet aluminum is highly inflammatory and toxic to the brain. This is madness. Why is infant mortality under 5 years the worst in the US, which gives 35 vaccines (!) and best in Iceland and Japan where they give just 11? A study in NZ found that unvaccinated children were far more healthy (far less asthma, excema, ADD) than vaccinated children. Get the facts people.

But there is no evidence to suggest that affirmative action can change that. Affirmative action is quite likely part of the problem, not the solution. It insults blacks and hispanics and breeds resentment in others. Let's stop discriminating against people because of their skin color and let's increase opportunity for everyone in our society, especially for those at the bottom of the economy."

(b) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGAN diet. (c) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGETARIAN diet. (d) The health risks that the entire VEGETARIAN population (both adults and children) face. The correct answer is (b). Some of these comments make wonder about the commenter's reading comprehension skills. Nina isn't saying that it's unhealthy to raise kids on a VEGETARIAN diet (i.e. one that includes eggs and dairy). Neither is she saying that adults should not be vegan due to health risks. She is saying that it's risky for BABIES AND CHILDREN to be fed a vegan diet. Why are so many people responding to this article with long-winded replies about how they became vegan as ADULTS and are enjoying the health benefits? And why are others citing healthy babies raised on VEGETARIAN food as a rebuttal to this article? What part of this do you not understand?!?!
741;7846;capital gains;1;0;to be a leader fair rich help others;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gains' is to argue for its taxation.;capital gains are and should be taxed;In spite of Republican whining, everybody needs Government. Somebody has got to pay, and it has to be the people who benefit from society, because there are no other sources. Bank interest is double taxed, and capital gains are and should be taxed. Contrary to the arguments that I see here, passive income is the most lethal of all to our social structure because it compounds wealth into the hands of a few lucky winners (sometimes just lucky enough to cheat), and deprives society, as a whole, of any chance to maintain a fair playing field for future generations. Capitalism is an amazing, but flawed human invention. Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are living in one of those times. We just need to fix that, and everything will be fine...........including the deficit.

Some say the gain has already been taxed when the income ws earned to make the investment. By that standard, only ordinary w-2 income should be taxed at standard marginal rates. A person who purchases 100 shares of XYZ for $50.00 a share and sells it to another investor for $100.00 a share makes $50.00 a share. Not one penny goes to XYZ company to, say, purchase equipment or even better, hire another employee (unless of course it's an IPO). It seems to be just another tax advantage written into law by millionaires for the benefit of the wealthy investment class. Tell me that people would not invest in capital markets if there was no tax advantage and I would laugh. It would be like suggesting that people would not work as plumbers or accountants if they did not get a tax break of 50%

I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children.

I think the bottom line is that asking people to take responsibility for their health, in the light of so called ""Societal problems/mass obesity"" theory is just a joke. If you want action, do something that rewards the behavior you seek to reinforce - lower health care premiums if you drop weight. If I hear another person claim that ""this is my natural weight and I'm comfortable with it"" I'm going to be sick.

The easiest solution is to refuse to lend Federal money to students who attend for-profits; however, the for-profit lobby is too powerful in Congress to make this happen. So Obama is proposing a compromise--rate all of the universities and decide on federal loans from there. Like the health insurance compromise that resulted in Obamacare, setting up a ratings system is a messy solution, but better than doing nothing. The growing student debt problem may very well be our next financial crisis, and if a ratings system can prevent it, so be it."

Justified only by the fear itself. Since I arrived in the United States in 1975 I have been constantly surprised by the easy fears that seem to affect and are expressed in different ways by a large section of the population. It has always intrigued me because the American stereotype is the opposite."

Even in the Deep South, less than 4% of the population owned a slave. And, history shows that amongst the Southern slave owners were Blacks and African Americans. When one considers that most of the wealth generated by the industrial revolution occurred in the slave free North, it's hard to agree with the author's statement that ""...much of the wealth enjoyed by"" the US was gained through the slave trade. Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US. It would make as much sense for African Americans to seek reparations from the West African kingdoms that captured the slaves and sold them to European slavers."

Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our ""smart bombs"" and ""smart phones"" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves ""by accident"" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago. I seriously doubt that even the average person's knowledge of basic geography is better today than that of my grandparents."

I'm a little stunned that Princeton would consider scrapping it. Estimates vary on what percentage of the world speaks or understands English - I've read between 12 and 25 percent - but even if you accept the higher of those numbers, that leaves three quarters of the world's population that does not. Jobs that require college degrees very often also require contact with people from other countries. To me it's clear that advanced education isn't complete without studying another language. Fluent in a second language? Take a third.

That proposition that has me paying 10x more taxes for my house than my neighbor in an identical house next door, and my neighbor across the street, in a mirror image house paying 4x more than me. It is an immoral law, that also buried California's once envious education system ... but that's what you get with republicans: Lack of willingness to fund infrastructure of the state or nation makes the nation grate not great.
751;19198;illegal labor;1;0;to make money. a profit money get rich;the intention of the tweet towards target 'illegal labor' is to criticize and expose the negative impact of using illegal labor in farming, and to advocate for better labor practices and regulations.;farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters. They like illegal;There would be very little difference in the price of fruits and vegetables if the farmers paid a reasonable wage. They'd need to do it together to not harm each other in the food market, that's what the unions and cooperatives are for. And we really need to license the labor contractors. So that they lose their licenses if they don't provide adequate water and toilets to workers in the fields. No farmer wants a dead worker featured in their harvest. It brings a farmer's competency into question among the community. Mostly, farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters. They like illegal aliens because they can unload the costs associated with hiring workers onto the neighboring communities. And because these workers are less likely to know and object when they are being exposed to pesticides or abuse.

What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others.

With those words, Hutchins did away with the University of Chicago's storied Big Ten football and gave the Stagg Field and the underground squash courts to physicist Enrico Fermi, who in turn soon created the world's first self-sustaining nuclear reaction there and the rest as they say is history. Had Hutchins not spoken those words, we might have been writing our comments in German or Japanese."

Homeowners who don't have fires should get a break on taxes they pay towards fire departments. Healthy people should get a break on taxes that go towards health care. Creationists should get a break on taxes that go towards scientific research. Taxes should be like a sushi bar: you just select the ones you think you should be paying a la carte on a handy menu.

Milner used this as an opportunity to push his upcoming book. Yes equality is a problem and has been a problem throughout human existence. He avoided the issue. All kids need to do homework. It is a simple way to see if your child is learning, if they sit down in front of an assignment and have no idea what to do, you as a parent need to be aware of that and help them learn. It's part of the job description, at least in my book. And if I can teach my kid more than someone else, well that's life. Someone will always have more and someone will always have less. I still need to do the best I can.

Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest!

I have often commented that beach front property would be wasted on me, and those who most want it and are willing to pay for it should have it. I do, however, believe that private ownership should be limited to the spaces above and adjoining the beaches. Public access to the beach seems to be a no-brainer. I believe we should also make these private owners of beach adjacent property responsible for rebuilding their own homes when the next storm or tsunami comes their way.

The corporate tax rate should be zero, and C Corp. earnings should be taxed like S Corp. earnings. That would eliminate the cause of cash hoards in Corp. treasuries, and provide more liquidity. Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups). But look out for the European outcome with high VAT, income, dividend, and capital gain taxes like Germany where too large a share of GNP is run through government accounts. We should have very little reliance on income taxes as they discourage both work and business. Those mega yachts, and mega dwellings are a simptom of the foolish tax laws we have now.

Why censure RGB for saying she thinks a certain candidate threatens the institution she represents if we're not going to censure others for saying during court that poor black folks are categorically unworthy/unprepared equal education opportunities or that gay people perhaps are worse parents than no parents at all?

They are a stand off weapon that puts enemy forces at risk, and they know it. Even if they aren't used the Al Qaeda and other terrorist organization operatives know they are at risk and it makes their operational plans that much more difficult to implement. If nothing else, in Cold War terms, they are an effective deterrent.

Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students.

I live on the Boise River in an area that has kept access open to the public. Just downstream, a fence cuts off access to the river thanks to a handful of homeowners have turned the banks of the river into their private back yard. This would be impossible without the publicly funded Corp of Engineers and other public agencies that control river levels through dams and regulations. Last time the river became a bit unruly, the national guard was called out to move earth and place sandbags to protect these areas. If you receive or need public help, then you need to provide public access.

USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice. I don't claim to be an expert, these are my prayerful thoughts on this topic. I believe that Reverend Robert Stearns speaks with wisdom, knowledge and insight.

In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians.

They have the success to show the way. We look up to them. Why shouldn't they have something constructive to say about education. I feel that traditionally trained teachers are chosen from the least talented pool of students. Their SAT and GRE scores are consistently in the bottom third. We need a bunch from the top third and the middle third, and we need huge improvement in MATH & SCIENCE. We do not need a bunch of obstructive, complacent union drones clogging up the arteries of education. We need more flexible educational leadership, and more rewards for excellent teachers.

Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them"

A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.

Now and then I have the chance to give advice to the young, and mine always is to dive into marriage and family early. We had 3 kids by the time I graduated from college (on time, at 22). We had two more by 28. True, my wife delayed finishing college; she got her degree in 1975 at age 27 instead of 1970. My other advice to the young: don't decide how to live based on what professors, the magazines, and the newspapers say is the latest thing. It's your life, get cracking on it."

This 'Food Babe' (neat commercial!) seems to think that her personal campaigns forced some mega food companies to change their labels. Consumer protest works, but not when it is a solo effort. A bit much self-promotion here. 2. This debate is about one word, ""natural."" Language is too complex for the debate to be about one word. The issue is can claiming in the name that something is not present. It defies logic to state in a product name that lemon is in the product when in fact there is no lemon at all. That is simply misleading (bold face lying). ""Lemon"" in common nomenclature is something that comes from the lemon plant, not it's laboratory produced analog. Isn't truth in advertising the issue? 3. My food slogan is ""I'm very careful about what I put in my mouth."" So that unfortunately means every label must be scrutinized."

First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all.

I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out. The economy of Israel is thriving; the economy of Palestine is horrible. Do the honorable thing. We Jews know a thing of two about persecution.

Notice, I said factual information. It is sad in our world today when the supporters of finding real information, librarians, have been systematically cut from school budgets. Many librarians have crossed the bridge to finding legitimate information in the digital world as well as printed materials.

789;3447;dual citizenship;1;0;to be a good citizen patriotic independent;the intention of the tweet is to argue against dual citizenship, stating that it is not allowed in the us and can lead to perjury.;Anyone holding an office of public trust or security, should not have any other citizenship than American;"""Nineteen out of the top 20 source countries for immigrants now allow their citizens to maintain the status even as they naturalize in the United States.""/i> Yes, but the US doesn't permit it. In order to naturize here, you must renounce any other citizenship you have. This is done is a sworn solemn Oath of Allegiance. Failure to do this is an act of perjury. And it makes sense, because otherwise you would not care about the country, knowing that have a place you can split to. There's a whole bunch who hold Israeli citizenship such as Michael Cherkoff, Ram Emmanuel, Richard Pearle, Paul Wolfawitz. And of course, Arnawld Schwarzenegger is an Austrian citizen. Anyone holding an office of public trust or security, should not have any other citizenship than American. And then there's Wen Ho Lee."
790;16924;universities recruiting out of state students;1;1;to get a degree go college job be educated;the intention of the tweet is to criticize universities for actively recruiting out of state students.;it's sad to see out of staters so actively enticed solely because;My alma mater, last I checked, has over 50% out of state students. I would never have believed how actively they recruited those students had it not been for a vacation several years ago in New York City. While perusing the Sunday Times over morning coffee, I saw a full page ad encouraging New Yorkers to consider Indiana University for their education. I'm sure other state schools do the same. I know there are funding issues as the state legislatures pull back their money, but it's sad to see out of staters so actively enticed solely because of their checkbooks paying that out of state tuition.
791;8327;music lessons;1;0;to be in charge control the best a leader;the intention of the tweet towards target'music lessons' is to criticize the over-controlling nature of the parent's approach to pushing their kids to take music lessons, and to suggest that it is more about snobbery than talent development.;I've seen many parents pushing their kids hard to take useless piano and violin lessons for reasons;The parenting Amy Chua is selling as Chinese is actually very common everywhere. I've seen many parents pushing their kids hard to take useless piano and violin lessons for reasons more connected with snobbery that the talent of the kid and I've seen people that parents pushed hard to become doctors or lawyers who at some point when they discovered that they are free adults that can make their own choices turned their backs at those careers and often at their parents. This is not Eastern philosophy, just an over controlling parent that is using her power over her kids to achieve goals for herself. Most shocking is her audacity to present her attitude as a way to follow.
792;17618;capital gains;1;0;to be in control make money. a success charge;criticizes capital gains tax policy.;NO MATTER how low the tax rates go, excess money goes to the Cayman;Peeking under the corner of Candidate Romney's tax return CLEARLY shows that NO MATTER how low the tax rates go, excess money goes to the Cayman Islands and Swiss bank acounts, NOT to American opportunities. Business needs ONLY an excess of paying customers and the same rules for all players. With only that they can manage and grow. REMOVE customers ready to pay and no reduction in rules or taxes can sustain business.
793;822;home schooling;1;0;to save money money. the learn;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the claim that home-schooling saves the taxpayers money.;home-schooling parents do not save the taxpayers any money;Bruce S. Cooper's reasoning lacks supporting evidence: home-schooling parents do not save the taxpayers any money just as parents' whose ill children miss several days of public school do not save taxpayers money. Nor do parents who send their children to parochial schools save tax dollars. Public schools still have to be built, maintained and staffed regardless of whether some families keep its children at home or choose to send their children to private or parochial schools. Public education must plan and staff to educate _every_ child in the district. I have yet to see any empirical evidence to support the idea that home-schooling or private or religious schools save the taxpayers' money. Flinging around statistics about the average per pupil cost of public education is not the same thing as providing evidence that private or home education reduce the necessary expenditures of public school systems. Can anyone cite any tax bill which was reduced when when parochial schools closed? Mary Askew
794;2955;syria;1;0;to win the war be in control charge power;the intention of the tweet towards syria is to express caution and opposition to any intervention, citing the negative consequences of previous interventions in libya.;Any intervention is a slippery slope to full involvement which is why we should stay as far away;Any intervention is a slippery slope to full involvement which is why we should stay as far away from Syria as possible no matter what they do. Lookt at Libya -- we started out with R2P just to save those Jihadist in Benghazi from Qaddafi. Well it quickly morpher into regime change in violation of the UN SC resolution. So we acted outside the law. We didn't care we are the US - we are not bound by any LAW not even one passed in Congress. And regime change in Libya led to the muder of a US Ambassador -- does anyone think that what is about to happen will end any differently. The President will lie to us as we were lied to about NSA and lied to about US intentions in Libya. In another month we will be bleeding and dying in Syria to remove Assad and install Al Nusra in power -- the so called FSA will either defect to Al Nusra or be buthchered by them. This is a disaster in the making for the US.
795;10752;sports program in undergraduate schools;1;0;to make money be rich get win;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the removal of sports programs from undergraduate schools and redirect resources towards other areas.;Sports is big business...Great...Move it out of ALL SCHOOLS and;Sports is big business...Great...Move it out of ALL SCHOOLS and into other plces. I wish our local schools would get out of sports, as we spend mch to much money on a few gifted athletes and almost nothing on our gifted students.
796;15959;language study;1;1;to learn something new understand gain knowledge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'language study' is to emphasize its importance in understanding different cultures and expanding our sense of the world.;Language study is about more than language study it has long been and remains at the heart of;"Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own."
797;18408;the status of public teachers;1;1;to help the poor be a leader helpful people;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the reactionary response of educators towards teach for america, which is seen as a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and urban schools.;Teach for America is a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and;According to this perspective, we should view Peace Corps volunteers as a threat to the developing world, Meals on Wheels as a threat to the culinary arts, and AmeriCorps as a threat to the United States. Teach for America is a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and urban schools, which pre-date the existence of this program by decades. The reactionary response from educators who have failed to improve the educational achievement of underserved students only reinforces the need for something new and innovative. No one pretends that TFA is THE solution to public education, but at least it's focused in a tangible way on the places with the greatest needs.
798;8486;parent;1;0;to be a good parent get education better have;the intention of the tweet towards target 'parent' is to criticize and express dissatisfaction with the school district and its handling of a racist incident involving a child.;No one was punished...b/c they were afraid of the moron parents;Our school district is terrrible, and the results even worse. Last year a child was T-Bagged and beaten because he was white by a group of black football players. No one was punished...b/c they were afraid of the moron parents. We send all 3 kids to private school at a considerable expense to ourselves yet the money we pay in taxes goes to the school we had to pull our kids from. Is that fair?

800;1491;a tax break;1;0;to be a good parent get tax break have education help the poor;the author of the tweet is expressing opposition to a tax break for private schools.;A tax break: no!;And do, I a parent who does not think the public schools are right for my kids get a tax break on private schools? What is the difference? If states want to provide a curriculum and resources to families in the state to use for education in lieu of public schools (as one commenter seems to suggest Alaska does) that makes sense to me. A tax break: no!
801;21505;gateway drug;1;2;get a better job to make living money;the intention of the tweet is to express the author's viewpoint on the american agricultural system, highlighting the dependency on unskilled labor and the related issues of cost, working conditions, and labor supply.;I read all the different opinions on this topic, I can boil it down to two statements.;When I read all the different opinions on this topic, I can boil it down to two statements. 1) The cost of farm labour is a small faction of the eventual cost of foods. 2) The current American agricultural system vitally depends on having a supply of unskilled labourers who are willing to work seasonal jobs with long, grueling hours, unsafe conditions, and little to no chance of advancement. A sufficient pool of people does not exist among legal American workers.
802;19298;business regulation;1;1;to be in control protect the public charge fair;the intention of the tweet is to argue for stronger business regulation to protect the public from harm.;We regulate to protect people before they become victims, and to give people recourse once they are;Marketplace regulation, or regulation by natural fallout of consequences in the marketplace, actually requires a company to victimize the public, before being caught out doing it. Certainly we can decide that some things the public can choose for themselves - unhealthy food, cars that chew up more gas for instance. But do we let the company take our money for a product that is not as advertised? Do we allow truck drivers to drive until they fall asleep at the wheel? Do we allow car manufacturers to produce cars that kill customers, and not require that they investigate and report on it? Do we allow companies to dump toxic metals in people's water supply? Do we allow companies to ship us salmonella and e coli as a matter of course? Or sell drugs that are untested? We regulate to protect people before they become victims, and to give people recourse once they are victimized. It is only common sense.
803;6827;broken windows theory;1;0;to get rid of something be a good citizen people in control charge;the intention of the tweet towards the broken windows theory is to acknowledge its validity in addressing neighborhood issues, but also to suggest that it is an outdated concept that can be improved upon with modern methods of crime prevention and enforcement.;I think there is a lot of validity to it;I don't think the broken windows theory itself is bad, I think there is a lot of validity to it.Having lived in marginal areas, things like graffiti, kids hanging out where they shouldn't, attractive nuisances, make a big difference in how a neighborhood functions. That said, what is old is new. Ask any long time New Yorker, and they will tell you about the beat cop, who knew what was going on, and knew who were the troublemakers, and knew how to deal with them appropriately. While it is a different era now, someone with a quality of life crime (like selling illegal cigarettes) can be dealt with by basically telling them to get lost and not show his face on 'his' street again. There are ways of using the force and power of the law without arresting people. If the person doesn't get the hint, or otherwise acts out, you always have the arrest as a backup, but most low level people will avoid the confrontation.
804;10836;monarchy;1;0;to be a leader have in power charge;the intention of the tweet is to express a desire for a monarch to hold a position of power in the united states, with a preference for prince charles.;I would give anything to have an enlightened monarch - think Prince Charles -;I would give anything to have an enlightened monarch - think Prince Charles - in a position of power in the United States! I only wish he was King of England already, though if he were President of the US, instead of King of England, it would be even better! Just imagine, someone above the fray, and completely committed to the welfare of the planet.
805;15786;kids at home;1;0;to have a good birth healthy baby safe pregnancy be mother;the intention of the tweet is to argue against homebirths and advocate for hospital births.;i have kids at home;These anti-homebirth rants have been going on since I had my four homebirth babiss some 20-32 years ago. And the infant and mother mortality figures are still among the worst in industrialized nations for U.S. hospital births. There is no queestion that prenatal care from a midwife is superior to that of any obstetrician and that alone makes for a safer experience for mother and child.
806;5346;delivery charges;1;1;to be generous fair polite helpful;the intention of the tweet is to criticize delivery charges as they are often misconstrued as tips and do not adequately compensate delivery drivers for their costs and efforts.;It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that;"It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a ""delivery charge"" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise ""free delivery"". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: ""Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?"" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can."
807;18840;vaccination;1;1;to be left alone in control charge not responsible;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration and disbelief towards anti-vaxxer parents who do not understand the importance of vaccination for the greater good.;The foolishness and selfishness of arguments like these never ceases to amaze me. I';The foolishness and selfishness of arguments like these never ceases to amaze me. I've had this argument with other anti-vaxxer parents, and they can't seem to get it through their skulls that the MAIN reason they don't HAVE to vaccinate their children-is be cause all the other responsible parents have already done so!!! They lack any understanding of what a social contract is or why it is necessary for civil life to continue, let alone the danger their sweet little child poses to people vulnerable to these diseases. Hey, why should I pay my taxes to pave my streets when all my neighbors have me covered on that one? Jeez
808;19651;sport program undergraduate school;1;2;to have a family be parent child happy;the author expresses pride and joy in her experience as an older single mother to adopted children, reaching milestones in their lives.;I adopted my nearly two year old daughter from China at 49 and three years later I brought home;As a single mother I adopted my nearly two year old daughter from China at 49 and three years later I brought home my son from China -- and he was nearly 13. Today he is one semester away from graduating college and she just had her Bat Mitzvah and is a rising eighth grader. Okay, so I am the oldest mom in her class -- in her school. Its not my fault. These are the children I was meant to have and I just had to wait for them to be available so I could bring them home. One of the best things about being an older parent -- one really doesn't care what others think.
809;20166;teaching writing research paper;1;2;to get a degree job make money. money;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the value of pageants as a means of promoting intelligence and achievement, and to suggest that they primarily serve as a finishing school for wealthy, high-end trophy wives.;Most of the smartest women I know aren't competing in pageants;Most of the smartest women I know aren't competing in pageants...and the opportunities these pageants provide in cash for a few women do not undue the harm that they cause for the millions of others that watch. The only 'brainy' thing the women do on stage is anwser a one-line question. Even the volunteering component is still a bit silly. Given that volunteering is now a pre-req for college admissions, these women don't achieve much more than their peers do. These pageants seem more like finishing school for future high-end trophy wives who are well-kept and dabble in charity on the side...
810;20349;tax break homeschooling parent;1;2;to protect his children the their be safe;the intention of the tweet is to compare homeschooling parents who receive tax breaks to those who actively abuse their children, implying that the former group is not deserving of the benefit.;I wonder if we should think of parents who would prefer their children to suffer childhood illnesses that;I wonder if we should think of parents who would prefer their children to suffer childhood illnesses that could be avoided by vaccination in the same class as those who are actively abusing their children. It seems quite similar to me.
811;5822;child rearing and technology;1;1;to be a good parent have time better fun;the intention of the tweet is to encourage parents to disconnect from technology and engage with their children in real-life experiences.;Parents need to genuinely interact with their children;Parents can start by disconnecting from their own social networking addictions and not diving into their cell phones every 3 minutes. Leave work and the world behind! Parents need to genuinely interact with their children, otherwise what's the point of taking the family somewhere new if everyone is simply bringing along their own 'entertainment bubble'? Take children to where they can really interact with real people or nature, not the plasticised, calorific worlds of ghastly theme parks and the like. For city kids especially, how about a farm vacation, where they can see how food is raised?
812;13063;foul;1;2;to win the game improve be competitive;the intention of the tweet towards target 'foul' is to suggest changes in the game rules to reduce the number of fouls committed.;deliberately hard fouls;"Having loved the skill, energy and movement in the pro game since seeing Wilt in an exhibition at the Garden in 1959 (when I was seven), why not first try these easier remedies to make each player more accountable: move the three point line back; stop the carrying while dribbling; get rid of the zone; and start calling giving two shots and the ball for deliberately hard fouls and not just excessively hard fouls; except in the fourth quarter, when all fouls become shooting fouls. The game in the 1960's and 1970's was a better quality game than the junk basketball that now prevails during the regular season. Oh yes: make a winning record on the road during the regular season much more significant."
813;11862;jerusalem;1;1;to be a leader in control power religious free;the tweet intends to compare and contrast the teachings of jesus and mohammed regarding jerusalem, and argues for america to take a stand to protect its rights and uphold freedom of religion.;Jesus Christ is a Jew. He preached in Jerusalem. Mohammed arrived centuries later.;Jesus Christ is a Jew. He preached in Jerusalem. Mohammed arrived centuries later. He overtook Jerusalem. Jesus is the Prince of Peace. Mohammed is the God of War. America was founded on the teachings of Jesus. Our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. We uphold and honor that freedom today. Islam does not teach freedom of thought. Saudi plays both ends against the Middle. America must take a stand. Protect our rights. Move our Embassy to Jerusalem.
814;21404;mandatory vaccine;1;2;to get a raise be paid more fair make money;the user is expressing their opinion on the federal minimum wage, arguing that all employees should earn a fair minimum wage, and suggesting eliminating the subminimum wage, especially in cases where tips already provide sufficient income.;It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods;It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.)
815;19710;vegan diet;1;2;to be a good person doctor save lives lives. safe;the intention of this tweet is to advocate for improving hospital settings and reducing risks, rather than moving medical procedures into homes.;a major campaign in many hospitals has successfully reduced the risk, and that is the right direction;The solution to the risks posed by hospitals is not to move procedures into the home, but to aggressively work on reducing the risks and improving hospital settings. No one would have a triple bypass in their living room just because they are more likely to get an infection in the hospital. The risk of infection is being addressed: a major campaign in many hospitals has successfully reduced the risk, and that is the right direction. Move forward, not backward.
816;19650;gene;1;2;to prove a point make comparison theory;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'gene' is to challenge the assumption that average iq scores have increased over time.;Unless the author has access to old IQ test raw scores, the assumption of increasing average;On an IQ test, the average person would have exactly the same score as the average person in his grandparents' time. That is 100! The author is referring to the raw unadjusted score. All IQ tests are set so that the mean, median, and mode equal 100! Unless the author has access to old IQ test raw scores, the assumption of increasing average IQ scores would be difficult to demonstrate.
817;20648;young people;1;2;to make a point be heard. heard fair;the intention of the tweet towards target 'young people' is to encourage them to be aware of and challenge the biases in mainstream media.;Excellent idea. However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this;Excellent idea. However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this issue all year long, and for this 'room for debate' issue in particular. While the Times deemed it appropriate to ask a Muslim living in the UK to write on the issue (of course, pro migration) for the sake of journalistic integrity the Room for debate should have also hosted the point of view of a native European citizen from any country who opposes it. It has come to the point that the people with the most to loose and with all the rights, are pushed aside, their rights and opinions discarded.
818;12187;marijuana;1;1;to be a good person get away from reality they want try it do;the intention of the tweet towards target'marijuana' is to defend its use and argue against the negative perception of it as a gateway drug.;I tried weed when i was 14. I became a social smoker around the age of;With all do respect. That is the dumbest argument ive heard... Ok maybe not I tried weed when i was 14. I became a social smoker around the age of 25 How many times have i tried Heroin? Zero Its like saying Donuts are the gateway to Diabetes. How about educate your children, yourself and those around you. Clearly trying to scare people off only increases there curiosity. Its like telling a child not to do something. They want to do it more. Be responsible. Nothing wrong with trying to escape reality for a couple hours. Especially with all the craiznews going on in the world. Be responsible.
819;17647;mother teresa;1;0;to be mean feel good cruel hurt someone;the intention of the tweet towards mother teresa is to criticize her actions and character.;Mother Teresa was a sadist;There are no saints. We do what we do because it's gratifying. We are compassionate because it feels good. We are nasty for the same reason. That includes the woman who thought it was a good idea to withhold pain meds because she wanted the dying to suffer. Mother Teresa was a sadist.
820;11166;musical instruments;1;0;to help them learn be helpful teach something;the intention of the tweet towards target'musical instruments' is to express disagreement with the idea that parents should force their children to play specific instruments, and instead should allow them to make their own choices.;I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play;I listened to the NPR Diane Rehm interview with Ms. Chua. She was asked if she would do anything differently now. She replied that she would give her daughters more choices. An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad. All I can say is that I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play, nor did I stand over them while they practiced. My youngest is now graduating in May with a degree in Aerospace AND Nuclear engineering! Nuf said!
821;18851;fees;1;1;to make more money money. a profit;criticizes overdraft fees as unprofitable and unsavory, and suggests that banks may be targeting small personal checking account customers with additional fees to encourage them to leave.;Overdraft fees were very lucrative (if unsavory;Banks have to make their profits somewhere. Overdraft fees were very lucrative (if unsavory). The additional fees we're seeing now are a direct result of the decreased profitability around overdrafts. Consumers really didn't understand the extent to which overdraftees were propping up the free checking account for te rest of us. Also, some fees are designed to encourage unprofitable customers to walk out the door. And you guessed it. Small personal checking account customers who never purchase other products (e.g. mortgages), never generate overdrafts, etc. - we are the proverbial deadbeats. Big banks would love to see us walk to the credit unions. They will even hold the door open for us and wave goodbye.
822;2640;retirement accounts (ira's & 401k's);1;1;to save for retirement be fair money avoid taxes;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for tax-free retirement accounts.;I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation;I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax rates on them are bupkis until I either roll over money to a Roth or withdraw from my IRA - which money (including gains) is then taxed like regular income. Conversely, gains in a mature Roth IRA aren't taxed when I eventually draw down from that account. Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates. Interest earned on FDIC protected savings accounts of $250K or under (the account balance, NOT $250K in interest) should also be exempt, and above that fully taxable. This would protect middle class savers should they ever actually see interest beyond pennies in their accounts.
823;12928;crime;1;0;to be a good citizen get rid of criminals person police officer leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'crime' is to criticize the police's approach to crime prevention and suggest that profiling is not an effective tool for preventing crime.;Profiling is the primary tool of crime prevention;Profiling is the primary tool of crime prevention which is actually what the police are supposed to do - prevent crime. Catching and punishing criminals is what the authorities do when they have failed to prevent crime. Unfortunately, profiling tells us more about the criminals among us than we, apparently, really want to know.
824;12466;palestinian authority;1;0;to be a leader in charge control independent;the intention of the tweet towards the palestinian authority is to criticize its lack of a strong central government, control of defined territory, and security.;Any nation wishing to declare independence should meet three essential elements: a strong central government,;"""But let's start with the basics. Any nation wishing to declare independence should meet three essential elements: a strong central government, control of defined territory and security. The Palestinian Authority does not yet meet any of them."" Historians would strongly disagree with you. Around sometime late eighteenth century some thirteen odd British colonies did ""declare independence"" without any resemblance of ""strong central government"" with its territory controlled by the British. Today a certain French foreign minister called it a ""hyper-power"" and not a ""failed state"". Please check upon a historian or read up your history. Trust me! It is true!!"
825;4371;declaw;1;1;PersonX is a cat lover. owner. wants to help the animals cats lover;the intention of the tweet towards target 'declaw' is to express strong opposition and condemnation.;I believe that declawing cats is animal abuse;I believe that declawing cats is animal abuse. Claws are a cats first line of defense and without their claws they are defenseless. I wish they would make this illegal everywhere. It is selfish for owners to do this. I have two cats who came to me already declawed and I worry that if I did not take them in they would be stray outside cats and probably would not survive. Also one of my cats loves sitting outside in the flower pot and would love to be outside more to explore and fully experience cat behaviors if she had her claws. It is also incredibly painful for the animal and even today just touching my declawed cats front paws makes her wince. If furniture is such a priority maybe you shouldn't have pets or keep them in a different area of your home. Declawing cats fingernails in my mind is equal to removing our feet and hands. If we didn't have our feet or hands we would be defenseless.
826;21621;regular diner patronage;1;2;to be inclusive teach learn educate;the intention of the tweet is to express the value and relevance of single-sex education, highlighting the different learning needs of males and females.;there's room in the world for mixed and single-sex education;As Native New Yorker said in those comments, there's room in the world for mixed and single-sex education. My experience has been that it's hard to know what a difference being in a same-sex classroom can make unless you've been there. I also know from my teaching experience that the males in a classroom need a different kind of learning space and shape than females often do, especially in the middle and high school years. They each get to the same place but often by different routes, and that's ok. It's not for everyone, but that's no reason to allow single-sex education to wither on the vine. It's relevant now, and will be in the future.

In most communities a majority of taxpayers have no children in grades 7-12 and thus no participation in after-school activities.

It could be worse, they may want to do something really dumb like cut taxes even more or try to start another war. First of all they don't have the votes and under 8 years of Bush the problems just got worse.
830;14514;u.s. embassy in israel;1;0;to be in control a leader charge power;the author intends to argue against the idea of moving the us embassy to jerusalem, stating that it will result in palestinian violence.;The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move;Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians.
831;3306;attacts;1;0;to be a leader protect the people save lives safe fair;the intention of the tweet is to express a desire for a more direct and violent approach to targeting those who demand war.;we don't target civilians as a matter of policy;The difference between us and them is that we don't target civilians as a matter of policy. That said, I wish we could draft the children and grandchildren of those who demand we conduct war by sending troops instead of drones.
832;757;war on poor;1;1;to help the poor be a leader save helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'war on poor' is to suggest that the lobbying power of wall street bankers is a roadblock to addressing issues such as tax reform and regulation, which in turn affects the poor.;the lobbying power of Wall Street bankers that is a roadblock to host of issues;Nationalizing the banks would only move them from a bureaucracy that is too big to one that is even larger. If we do nationalize them, at least do it the way we created Government Motors, creating smaller leaner institutions. I would support the Warren-McCain Glass-Steagall Act update. The one issue overlooked in this discussion is the lobbying power of Wall Street bankers that is a roadblock to host of issues from tax reform to their War on the Poor to regulation. Could I suggest that a change in the phraseology from Too Big to Fail to Too Big to Regulate?
833;11903;basketball;1;0;to be a better player the best good make game easier;the intention of the tweet is to discuss the impact of raising the rim on basketball and its potential effects on different levels of play.;You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring;Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball).

Unfortunately, conservative judges and law makers dedicated to protecting their business patrons have succeeded in emasculating our ability to use civil law for relief. Recent NYT articles have revealed how business has been using arbitration to avoid be sued. Wise law makers and judges work to protect the public from harm, but it seems that wisdom is lacking in far too many current law makers and judges. Greed is winning!

Advancements in medical technologies;Yes, I do believe we are devolving to some degree. Advancements in medical technologies have negated Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest allowing more than a few people who may have perished due to their own stupidity to not only survive but reproduce.

We need to;This is one of the most intelligent articles I have read on Syria. Hoffman is right -- this is a civil war, and only the Syrians can resolve it. We need to stay out of this - it is not our concern.

In fact, to get a decent job. I understand we have multiple languages there but I would have never been able to find a job and do any international work without it. Now that I live in the US and work at a multinational company, it would be even better to know more languages like Spanish or French...so I applaud the colleges who recognize and require that.

Iraq fell apart after we removed Saddam Husein...and as a result, the Sunni insurgency began, Al Quaeda reincarnated and ISIS was born ... all in Saddam's absence. Our war in Iraq was a mistake, our war in Libya was a mistake... we must not repeat those same mistakes in Syria. Tyrants like Assad are what keeps the extremists under control. The culture of the middle east needs those dictators that keep the extremists in check... removing those dictators will open the flood gates of Islamic extremists that could threaten the world as ISIS is doing now. We need to work with Assad, with Iran and with all those countries and groups who have been fighting ISIS.
839;9663;jerusalem;1;1;to be a leader helpful supportive show support;the intention of the tweet towards jerusalem is to support israel's right to exist as a jewish nation and to recognize jerusalem as israel's eternal capital.;if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within;If the USA Embassy is truly 100% constantly strong and unified in supporting Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to be a Jewish nation and Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital then yes and amen, stand bold and strong with the uncompromised rights of Israel. USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice. I don't claim to be an expert, these are my prayerful thoughts on this topic. I believe that Reverend Robert Stearns speaks with wisdom, knowledge and insight. Above all may G-d's righteous holy will be done. -Reverend Tracie Plungis, NJ, USA
840;8052;commercial relationship;1;0;to save money for retirement more;the intention of the tweet is to express dissatisfaction and switch to a credit union.;I do due diligence before beginning a commercial relationship;I tend to be a loyal consumer. I do due diligence before beginning a commercial relationship, but then I expect that the companies with whom I do business will treat me with equity and respect. I recently received notification from a bank that I have had accounts in for more than 20 years. I have always had at least one paycheck being direct deposited, I have had 2 or three savings accounts, auto loans, and investment accounts. I have always played by their rules, but the interest paid on savings dwindled to next to nothing (.03%) while charges, fees, and penalties have ballooned. The final straw came a couple of weeks ago when a whole new list of fees came out. Not only are they going to charge for paper statements (I went paperless years ago), but they are going to charge for online access! And they are going to charge $5/month for savings accounts that don't have automatic deposits going to them. Enough is enough! I am switching to a credit union.
841;12230;teacher;1;1;to get a good job be teacher better grade job.;the intention of the tweet towards teachers is that the author believes that political correctness, lower acceptance standards, and lowered standards for teachers and students are leading to ignorance and a lack of incentive for teachers to learn.;lowered standards for teachers and students;Political correctness, loweracceptance standards to ensure minority hiring, lowered standards for teachers and students, inability to read at one's chronological age, having to teach to the lowest achiever in the class, and a gov't that pays people when they can't get (or won't) jobs, all lead us down the path of ignorance. For many people, there is no incentive to learn anything other than what they have to.
842;7552;law enforcement;1;0;to be a good person citizen get rid of people make point;criticizes the limitations of law enforcement in combating corruption.;successful law enforcement is often impossible;"Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call ""corruption"" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a ""you wash my back and I'll wash yours"" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible."
843;5783;office privacy;1;1;to be left alone alone. by himself themselves;the author's intention towards 'office privacy' is to have a private office or work space with a door they can close.;Personally I want a private office or work space with a door I can close;Personally I want a private office or work space with a door I can close. That's just me. If I could do without a telephone I think that would be heaven. An employees' cafeteria or lounge would be more than adequate to satisfy my social needs. Perhaps I feel this way because I was an only child and have always been content with my own company. I don't dislike company - I merely want to decide for myself when I want company and when I don't. I find most social situations a waste of my time. Why be bored to death at a party when there is a good book to read in the comfort of one's own home?
844;9547;economists;1;0;to make a point understand the situation problem decision;the user is expressing their concern about the subjective nature and real-world impact of economics, which can make it challenging to discuss objectively.;Economics is far from an exact science;I can think of of two large problems: 1. Economics is far from an exact science, with precise terminology, methods of proof, and purpose. 2. It has impact affecting our personal standards of living, therefore it is hard to have a cool head and argue and think about economics from an objective point of view.

846;10216;marijuana;1;0;to be a good person get away with something citizen from safe;the intention of the tweet towards target'marijuana' is to refute the idea that it is a gateway to more illegal activity.;By legalizing, it is no longer a gateway to more illegal activity;Pot may historically be correlated with increased illegal drug use. But perhaps the deciding factor isn't the marajuana, but the illegal activity: once you've done one thing illegal, it's easy to do more. By legalizing, it is no longer a gateway to more illegal activity.
847;17556;nutrition;1;1;to lose weight be healthy healthier eat less;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of portion size in nutrition and weight management.;The single most important issue is 'portion size';"The single most important issue is 'portion size'. People don't need to change how they cook as much as they need to change how much they cook. My son gained weight when he left home, but when he lost 50 lbs with the help of a diet sold by a national franchiser, he realised that the amount of food that he was served at home (and complained about) was a normal portion size. Now he is much more thoughtful about what food he orders, even from the fast food chains. Try searching on the term ""portion distortion' and look at the 2 powerpoint presentations from the NIH. They are very useful in teaching patients about what to eat and how active you must be if you eat the large portions that are sold."
848;10913;palestine;1;0;to be left alone in control charge power;the author's intention towards palestine is to criticize the israeli government's stance on negotiations and to support the idea of a nation state for the palestinians.;Whatever schisms exist within the Palestinian are for them to resolve;This article is tantamount to asking a criminal's mother to give him a character reference! The author is a former member of the IDF. Enough said. Netanyahu and his cabal do not want to negotiate, period. So, the Palestinians are left to their own devices. Whatever schisms exist within the Palestinian are for them to resolve. That state of affairs does not preclude a nation state for the Palestinians. The forces of change, good and bad, are closing in on Israel. Tempus fugit!

The succession is not a popularity contest. Nobody gave tuppence for George VI's chances when he came to the throne - the stutterer - yet he proved to be a good and decent king, who burnished the crown with honor. And the writer might want to check the veracity of the toothpaste story - it happened when Charles had a broken arm.

We are becoming a much less equal nation in this and in many other ways as the plutocrats are helping in creating these venues for keeping what they believe are the lower classes, out. The rest of us will be relegated to the chain restaurants.

I average 8 hours of homework every night with 6-7 hours of school in a day. I also work about 3 hours a day. I do not sleep. I spend most of my weekend sleeping, until Sunday where I do 12 hours of homework. I love school and I love learning, and I'd argue the school day needs to be extended. The teachers do not have enough time to teach us all we need to know, especially in AP courses. Thus, we have an incredible amount of homework, depriving us of sleep, and leading to the negative consequences Ms. Carskadon warns. So, as long as teachers have more time to teach while at the same time giving less homework, I'm all for extending the school day.
852;20462;worker;1;2;to learn something be productive more;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'worker' is to suggest that it is more beneficial to spend time sorting, organizing, analyzing and synthesizing information rather than just putting in time.;It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation;"""It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used."" Gottfried Liebniz I looked that up on the internet. It took about 15 seconds. Would it be more beneficial had I gone to the reference section of my library? It is worthy to spend one's time sorting, organizing, analyzing and synthesizing information, unworthy to just put in time."
853;4520;bureaucracy;1;0;to be the best a leader make money competitive;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the bureaucracy for using school food programs to cross-subsidize education and to advocate for the use of federal school meal reimbursements for school meal production.;Federal school meal reimbursements need to go towards school meal production, not school bureacra;The new school meal guidelines from USDA will be far more of a game changer than anything WalMart does. They also will be far more effective in terms of giving manufacturers good reason to invest the money and effort to develop new products that meet the guidelines while maintaining taste. The fact is, such products on the shelves of WalMart will always have the competition from less healthy products such as you allude to. If you want to sell the vast school market, the playing field will be level. The real question is whether local school boards will accept the idea that they can't use school food programs to cross subsidize education, and that Federal school meal reimbursements need to go towards school meal production, not school bureacracy overheads.

Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds.

Suppose instead of a regulation describing a testing station the law said that if a car exceeded the pollution standards the manufacturer would have to refund the full original retail price of all units of that model car (including sales tax) and pay a fine for all the miles driven. Then all the mechanisms in the world for cheating wouldn't matter; just getting caught once would be the end of the corporation. Inventions guarantee that methods will change but the outcome is the outcome."

Apart from the fun of the sport, spirit of the game attracted athletes away from their roots in more conventional referee based sports. The sport has grown tremendously in the past 20 years and there are now legions of ultimate players the world over--competitive athletes--who identify as ultimate players. They practice hard, they travel to compete, they are committed to the sport through playing, coaching, and leadership. Having represented my university, my hometown, and my country at national and world championships, I am thrilled that American boys and girls now playing for their middle school or high school teams will soon be playing for USA on the greatest stage of all. Ultimate will restore and advance the Olympic spirit. And yes, observers to settle disputes that players cannot themselves immediately settle is the way to go.

Actually, what is imperative is that law schools not continue to admit people that are not prepared to pass the bar examination. The law schools have to reduce the number of law students to match the number of job openings. The only problem we have is that the law schools are a bit in decline and need to adjust the numbers and live with lower budges.
858;3581;latin is helpful for other languages;1;1;learn a new language to another something languages;the intention of the tweet towards target 'latin is helpful for other languages' is to suggest that learning latin can make learning other languages easier.;Latin would have been the better way to go, since mastery of that makes learning the languages;One's own, and learning another language is important and a great work out for the brain! Back in the day, I learned Spanish! In retrospect Latin would have been the better way to go, since mastery of that makes learning the languages like French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish, very much easier to learn! I would recommend it, But it's 2016, and let's face it, if you lived in southern Brooklyn today, Russian, Ukrainian, Cantonese, Arabic, and Ghetto Yiddish is the way to go! However, if one lives in the United States as a whole, circa 2016, Mandarin, has got to be the way to go! Who knew?!!! Nixon's The One.

What for? The Castro brothers and their sycoph;Lift the embargo? What for? The Castro brothers and their sycophants are deeply entrenched and are not going anywhere, with or without an embargo. Lifting the embargo will just make them even...wealthier than they already are. Those two despicable hypocrites call themselves Communists and are living in luxury while most on the island struggle everyday to survive. And don't kid yourselves, they have ruled with an iron fist for 54 years and have executed thousands, and thousands of people without batting an eyelash in order to stay in power. Many, many more have perished in the high seas trying to escape. Many lives lost, families destroyed, misery, poverty, hunger, and for what? What kind of a revolution was that?

Sex work - oldest profession - is not going away. Reduces AIDS and STDs when controlled. Half the celebrities are sex workers of sorts selling their bodies so why not the ones who actually have sex be allowed. Not everyone wants to do that. It has a strange effect on the psyche of women. An act made for bonding and love done with people you dont like - messes with the mind.

I want lawmakers to have close ties to competent research librarians. I want lawmakers to research, seriously research, the matters they vote on. Without librarians providing RELIABLE data, a lawmaker is voting based on guess, bias and campaign donations.

The corn and soy farmers I know all vote Republican and at the same time are eager for their government checks.

My high school classmates and I were the guinea pigs for the pilot program at LSU's University Lab School in 1953. The course was quite comprehensive. It covered the mechanics, contraception, VD, prostitution, deviant sexual behavior. I don't recall the word abstinence being used. However, the teacher, J.Q. Long, emphasized that sex should be more than a physical act with potentially serious consequences, physical and psychological, and was not to be undertaken casually. Twenty-five years later I was amazed when some parents in my children's school in Michigan objected to the sex education courses which I'm pretty sure were less comprehensive than mine thirty years before in Louisiana.

Because the Palestinians are not recognized by Israelis as being divinely created equal with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If America was treating Mexicans and Canadians the way Israel treats Palestinians then it should expect resistance and would deserve it. American revolutionaries used violence to gain their independence. Zionist Jews used violence to obtain their nation state.

Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided.
869;19559;matter election;1;2;to be a good person get ahead in life job parent;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the idea that the current economic climate is the primary cause of problems, using the example of the author's father who built a home and cared for a sick child in a challenging economic climate without modern conveniences or support systems.;We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously;"""This is a rational response to the challenging economic climate."" Herein lies a large part of the problem. We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously? My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with, built a home & cared for a very sick child with no insurance or public assistance at a time when inflation & interest rates on loans were double digits. There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education. So please, stop blaming this GREAT economy (low unemployment, low interest rates, strong markets, easy access, public assistance out the wazoo) & start looking within."
870;2232;the bar;1;1;to get a good job be teacher able teach lawyer work;the intention of the tweet towards 'the bar' is to criticize the proposal of mr. allard that would separate accreditation from education for lawyers, as it would lead to lower standards and profit-driven universities.;Law is a professional degree. As in the case of licenced professional engineers, acc;This proposal has it backwards. Law is a professional degree. As in the case of licenced professional engineers, accredition needs to be be separated from education, or the educators, If the proposal of Mr. Allard woulb be adopted, Universities, in search of more students (law schools are highly profitable) would inevitably water down the standards.
871;16083;income;1;0;to get a degree be fair inclusive racist;the intention of the tweet towards target 'income' is to argue that class-based affirmative action in college admissions is a more effective solution to address economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, as it directly addresses the issue of income, while race-based affirmative action creates more discrimination based on race and assumptions that a student got in only because of race.;It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income;I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in.
872;15480;immigration;1;0;to be a good worker citizen help the poor leader fair;the intention of the tweet is to propose a solution to the illegal immigration problem by restricting unskilled and semi-skilled work to union members under contract with employers, ensuring that only documented workers can work and employers pay decent wages and safe working conditions.;There is a solution to the illegal immigration problem which could be implemented quickly and with just one;There is a solution to the illegal immigration problem which could be implemented quickly and with just one new law. Make all unskilled and semi-skilled work in this country restricted to members of unions under contract with any and all employers who hire employees for that kind of work. This would assure that only those documented could work and no employers could escape paying decent wages and the safe working conditions by who they hire, anymore. Eliminate the incentive to exploit undocumented labor and thus end the lure of jobs that attract the vast numbers of people who are entering this country.
873;1372;timing of parenting;1;1;to have a child be parent raise family;encourage young women to have babies on the younger side, if they have a choice.;Late twenties seems optimal;I agree with many of the posters: there is no one 'right' decision about the timing of parenting. That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around.
874;5484;school curriculum;1;1;to be a good student get grade better education job;the user expresses a desire for curriculum transparency, advocates for academically challenging classes, and disagrees with mandatory character education that requires respect for all opinions.;Too many times, the syllabus for any given course is behavior focused with no mention of the topic;I'd just like to see the curriculum. Too many times, the syllabus for any given course is behavior focused with no mention of the topic material to be covered. I also have to agree with one of the commentators below. Language Arts and similar classes are not academically challenging for good readers because of the need to accommodate those who struggle. I don't object to helping those who struggle but I would certainly let my child opt out of classes where he/she does not learn anything new. I'd also opt out of the character education training, which too often, requires students to respect everyone's opinion.
875;15295;len penzo's salary;1;1;to be generous helpful nice fair show appreciation;the intention of the tweet towards target 'len penzo's salary' is to suggest that the salary of len penzo should be determined by the tips received from readers based on their perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity.;let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips!;I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.

During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law. Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake. Only the US Government's continuing presence at a distance has prevented the net from becoming an international kleptocracy. Only governments are rooted in law. They should govern the internet.

A great moment in non;Almost exactly 50 years ago today we had the March on Washington. A great moment in non-violence. Did we learn nothing? We should bomb the people who are being gassed? IF there was a way to extract Assad and have him stand trail for war crimes I would be all for it. To pour more violence into the region does not make sense to me. That said I do not know what the answer is.

Putting ""environmental safeguards"" in place and preventing disasters are not the same thing. Standard, well intentioned engineering practice in oil production, refining, and transport includes safeguards like double and triple redundant fail safe systems. Still, engineered systems fail and all too recently we've had well-head blowouts (Deep Water Horizon), refinery explosions and fires, and oil transport disasters ranging from pipeline ruptures to tank train derailments to the Exxon Valdez. Imagine a perfect storm situation off Virginia Beach where a well head blowout coincided with a Hurricane Sandy. Crude oil from the Chesapeake to Iceland and a potentially mortal blow to already fragile shore communities and fisheries along the way. The only way to be 100% sure that the East Coast won't suffer catastrophic damage from oil production is to outlaw the outlandishly risky exploitation of hydrocarbons in our salty ocean waters."

Clearly they are trying to imply the item is 'healthy' or possibly 'organic', but when you see food 'manufacturers' like Frito-Lay or Campbell's with products labelled 'natural', that alone should set off alarms that all is not what it seems. ;-)"

882;5732;us population;1;1;to get a job degree make money be rich;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'us population' is to criticize the current state of education and social cohesion in the us, and to express concern about the loss of social responsibility due to greed.;The pursuit of wealth trumps pursuit of knowledge for those whose families have been Americans;This is a dumb question. The US population is very diverse and becoming more fragmented. We have a two-tier educational system that is providing a decent education for the affluent and a miserable one for the poor or near poor. There is a sizeable minority that is anti-intellectual and anti-science, who feel religion beliefs are being undermined by modern concepts and morality. On the other hand the scientific education provided by the elite graduate schools is the best in the world and better than ever. Unfortunately most of the people taking advantage of that education are either foreign born or first generation Americans. The rest prefer to become lawyers, get degrees in business administration or get jobs in the financial sectors. The pursuit of wealth trumps pursuit of knowledge for those whose families have been Americans for more than 2 generations. The most worrisome trend is not that the population is dumbing down but that social coherence is being lost and greed is replacing a sense of social responsibility.
883;9139;privatization;1;0;to make a point believe in something decision be informed;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the commenter 1's argument for privatization and to demand evidence to support it.;There appears to be NO instance of something that should not be privatized;I think commenter 1 provides a good example: of people having closed minds. Either he didn't read the column, or he is so convinced of his beliefs that he ignores facts/data. There appears to be NO instance of something that should not be privatized, despite the evidence to the contrary presented by Dr. (?) Warner. If he wants me to support privatization of specific services, show me some data!

Academic study, any research paper done today has international data avilable like never before. The internet is full of terrible information as well, undocumented, unproven and unreliable. However if used right one can learn as much with a computer and the internet as any university can teach. I have educated myself with the internet on a number of subjects I am interested in and can answer off the cuff questions regarding any of those given subjects with direct factual answers without rhetoric.

885;16446;wait staff;1;1;to get a raise be paid more fair make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'wait staff' is to argue that the federal minimum wage for all employees is $7.25 per hour and under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this.;It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods.;It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.)

The laws have become a new form of Jim Crow to prevent minorities from voting. Your chance of becoming a felon is much greater if you are dark of skin hue. Or a different ethnicity than being a WASP.

887;15417;danger;1;0;to be informed smart educated learn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'danger' is to express concern about the lack of common sense in today's society.;In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot;In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot, or to remove the plastic wrap of something before eating. I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that.

I have no idea what the solution in the middle east is, and frankly, even with all of your expertise Mr. Gerecht, neither do you. But the first step towards sanity is recognizing that we have to have new solutions because the old ones haven't worked."
890;7343;sweet briar;1;1;to gain knowledge be heard learn something;the intention of the tweet towards sweet briar is to express gratitude for the confidence and voice empowerment gained at the college, and to advocate for single-sex education as a beneficial learning environment.;One of the things my sisters and I learned at Sweet Briar is how to use our voice;Sweet Briar may not have a computer science major, but it is one of only two women's colleges that have an engineering degree. One of the things my sisters and I learned at Sweet Briar is how to use our voice. How to speak up and be confident. By knowing we could do that in a safe, nurturing environment, we knew we could do it in a hostile environment. I took 1 college course at a co-ed school. It was an education class that was about 2/3 women. Guess who did 75% of the talking? Guess whose opinion was validated by the professor and the TAs? Not the majority. Single-sex education (yes, I think men should have the single-sex opportunity too) may not be for everyone, but to argue that it is not a beneficial learning environment is uninformed and ignorant.
891;11732;monopolization of capital;1;0;to make money money. a profit living;the intention of the tweet towards target'monopolization of capital' is to argue against the notion that walmart's expansion into groceries will lead to monopolization, citing the example of chinatown's affordable and fresh groceries.;I wish Walmart well in this endeavor, though I've had problems with some of its past;I wish Walmart well in this endeavor, though I've had problems with some of its past actions. As for all those people who say it can't be done, that the profit won't be there for small markets: Have any of you ever been to Chinatown? Not San Francisco Chinatown, not New York Chinatown, just any Chinatown. You'll find the cheapest groceries in town there--it might not be top AAA quality, and maybe you won't find those exotic tomatoes, but it'll be inexpensive and fresh. The grocers there figured out the beauty of volume sales a long time ago. So did Walmart with its household goods, and now it's extending it to groceries. Good for them.
892;17864;democracy and capitalism;1;0;to be in charge control power a leader;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the current financial system under capitalism and democracy, and suggest a return to the original position of financial institutions being under direct control of the administration.;Financial institutions should be return the position that first of all institution had began the first;Simple !. We live in democracy and capitalism. Under the this two norms, we have to maintain the free competition. The other hand, financial institutions have became the indispensable organ of the nation and common economy. Administration obligate to manage this financial system work to both whole nation's economy and citizen's good. Ultimately nature will demand financial system should be under the direct control of administration. But can you accept that concept? No, so, Financial institutions should be return the position that first of all institution had began the first. First, separate again Investment bank and place under the strict jurisdiction and supervision.

My HS age granddaughter needs help evaluating reference material. Example: Why not depend on Wikipedia only? Libraries and the Internet work together and a library can't exist on its own. Without a person in the facility to keep it going and to teach students its value, it will die. Teacher or media specialist is not the issue. We need to support public education fully. That means teachers, the arts, sports, and the Media Center.

He might have discovered that the FDA advises against prescribing these drugs for common illnesses due to serious side effects affecting tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system causing permanent disability. In fact, within an hour of taking one pill, my knees became numb. I discontinued the drug but the numbness has not gone away. The tools available through allopathic Western medicine are flawed at best. Most of our drugs have questionable value and all have side effects. Treatments manage symptoms without offering cures. They keep patients in treatment for decades. Most doctors are hampered from freely applying even those flawed tools by the strictures of insurance companies and practices which limit office visits to 15 minutes. It's medicine practiced by accountants, not doctors. And unfortunately, many doctors are simply not very good. So IMHO, Dr. Google deserves a place in the exam room.
896;12856;family trips;1;1;to have a good time be parent host fun fun.;the intention of the tweet is to promote family trips and encourage parents to plan trips with their kids that allow them to experience new cultures and learn valuable life skills.;We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries;We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries. TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips.

899;15664;medicine side effects;1;1;to have a family child baby be parent children;the intention of the tweet is to raise awareness about the toll that fertility treatments can take on a woman's personal and professional life due to the side effects of the medications.;the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work;One thing that many young women may not realize is just how hard IVF is. I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after a single round. But I was surprised by the toll that fertility treatments took on me personally and professionally. The shear number of clinic visits made the process highly time-consuming, and the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work. So if it feels inconvenient to balance children with work at a younger age, keep in mind that the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are inconvenient and career-impacting in of themselves... and that's all before the baby actually arrives!

901;19160;fertility;1;0;to have a family be parent mother child children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'fertility' is to suggest that maternal maturity and necessary life experiences are important factors to consider when deciding when to have children, and that the best time to become a mother is between 25 and 35 when fertility is generally decent and chronic health problems have not yet set in.;fertility is generally decent;Maternal maturity is just as important as fertility when deciding when to have children. Very few women younger than age 25 have the maturity and necessary life experiences to become a mother at such a young age. At least in my opinion, the best time to become a Mom is somewhere between 25 and 35. The maturity is there, fertility is generally decent and chronic health problems have not yet set in.

Capital punishment for seemingly minor crimes. Disrespect and abuse of women. Harsh punishments and imprisoning of dissenters. Even much more than these few examples. The only thing that can do the job of civilizing those with these kinds of beliefs is a modrate regime change. This will only come through a similar type of revolution that put the current Iranian regime in power.

She was asked if she would do anything differently now. She replied that she would give her daughters more choices. An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad. All I can say is that I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play, nor did I stand over them while they practiced. My youngest is now graduating in May with a degree in Aerospace AND Nuclear engineering! Nuf said!
904;20022;medical website;1;2;get a better job to they;the author expresses skepticism towards farmers protesting immigration policies, suggesting they prioritize cheap labor over accountability, and promotes the benefits of locally grown produce and employing unemployed americans.;I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability;Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.

The price paid by both is almost super human , the outcome justifies it.
906;20856;affirmative action;1;2;to get a good education be student citizen parent educated;the intention of the tweet is to argue for affirmative action in education.;Why should children whose parents can pay for private school be the only kids guaranteed a safe;Why should children whose parents can pay for private school be the only kids guaranteed a safe, disruption-free learning environment? Charter schools offer families without the funds to pay for private school a similar environment and the opportunity to be surrounded by other students whose parents value their education and have been socialized to behave appropriately in school.
907;14843;parent;1;0;to be happy. a success happy successful independent;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'parent' is to criticize the helicopter parenting style commonly seen in asian colleagues and encourage a more relaxed and supportive approach to parenting.;I was raised by loving parents who wished me the best and allowed me to explore my desires;I am Jewish. I was raised by loving parents who wished me the best and allowed me to explore my desires. I had two Ph.D.'s by the age of 24. I have three children, one a MD-PhD, one a JD, and one a horse farmer. All did as they wished- I told them to do it well- Period. Life is too short for the helicopter parenting I see in my Asian colleagues. Be happy, eat dessert first, life will be over before you know it.
908;1447;private school;1;0;to be a good parent get tax break have education help the poor;the intention of the tweet towards private schools is to argue against a tax break for private schools.;a parent who does not think the public schools are right for my kids get a tax;And do, I a parent who does not think the public schools are right for my kids get a tax break on private schools? What is the difference? If states want to provide a curriculum and resources to families in the state to use for education in lieu of public schools (as one commenter seems to suggest Alaska does) that makes sense to me. A tax break: no!

Studies have shown that every time someone picks up a pen to complain to a Congressman or someone in authority, it represents four hundred people who feel the same but haven't made the effort. If Nessa is reading these responses to her, she would do well to take them to heart and mention it in the next board meeting.
910;16249;companies;1;0;to get rid of pollution be a good citizen something person;the intention of the tweet towards target 'companies' is to criticize the focus on vw as a distraction from other polluters and to argue for effective enforcement rather than relying on the honor system.;When corporations are allowed to control the testing, it is downright silly to get outraged;This outrage at VW is misplaced for two reasons. First, because focus on VW takes the heat off polluters that matter. All the VWs diesels on the road combined put out less pollution than a single power plant. Second if something is worth regulating, it is worth effective enforcement. Enforcement via the honor system is no enforcement at all. When corporations are allowed to control the testing, it is downright silly to get outraged when discovering the results are rigged.
911;12520;nuclear weapons;1;0;to win the war be in control power a leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'nuclear weapons' is to argue that israel's possession of nuclear weapons is a threat to iran's existence and that the us should withdraw all sanctions and compensate iran for damages.;An Iran with nukes would disrupt Israel's cruel and outrageously exercised Mideast;An Iran with nukes would disrupt Israel's cruel and outrageously exercised Mideast hegemony. Israel has ICBM nukes and threatens Iran's very existence, actually campaigns for war against Iran. We must withdraw all sanctions and compensate Iran for damages from the $$ Billions we will no longer be giving Israel annually. American foreign policy must again serve American interests, not AIPAC or the Jewish state's paranoid pursuit of invulnerability, territorial conquest and apartheid empire in, and beyond, the Mideast.

It presumes that an employer or an insurance company has a right to make a judgment on employees' personal lives, which is every bit as offensive as arguing that the government should do it. We have reached a sorry state in our Calvinist existence when we presume to judge why people look the way they do at what may be a genetic level.

As more and more people try to change their eating habits it is critical that labels are clear, easily understood and enforceable. Proper labeling is one of the ways to ensure that consumers have the information needed to make informed and accurate decisions.

What other nation is stupid enough to fight a war to beat its enemies, and then goes back in and spends billions to build them up again? And again. What other nation is stupid enough to get involved in wars between murderous factions within the same country who have been killing each other for a thousand years? What other nation would destroy its major manufacturing businesses, and put millions of its citizens out of jobs, by sending the work overseas. What other nation would tolerate disgraceful music, TV and movies for its young that features the lowest in human degradation masquerading as entertainment?
915;20062;europe;1;2;to help the poor kids learn children be helpful;the user is advocating for early education access and support for lower-middle-class children, emphasizing the benefits of play-based learning and late introduction of reading skills, as exemplified by new zealand's successful literacy rates.;New Zealand has a free preschool program, but the kids don't start learning to read;I agree with some of the comments about not pushing kids too young to read and write. However, kids benefit from a preschool environment even if it is all play based. New Zealand has a free preschool program, but the kids don't start learning to read until they enter elementary school and NZ has one of the highest literacy rates in the world. It also benefits those who are in the lower middle class and don't qualify for free programs. This is where we really need to start making a push. So that their kids don't end up in the lower class.
916;12193;humanitarian aid;1;1;to be helpful help others people;the intention of the tweet towards humanitarian aid is to criticize the attitude of some bengali intellectuals who are uncomfortable with mother teresa's priorities and actions, and to defend her legacy as a humanitarian who made a real difference in the lives of the poor and needy in kolkata.;Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the s;Shame on you. It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you're sitting on your... laurels. I grew up in Kolkata in the 80s. Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the slums in the central and northern parts of the city. More importantly, she drew attention to the plight of the homeless and dying in the city. I get that this makes some Bengali intellectuals, such as Aroup Chatterjee, uncomfortable. So what? So her priorities didn't agree with yours. Since when did your priorities become the yardstick for sainthood?

I refer to the small to medium size family farm. Smaller farms can detail their crops and rotations to better conserve soil and water. They support a traditional farmer life style. Small farms support small towns, local banks, grocery stores, schools, equipment dealers and a wide farmer's work ethic. Larger farms destroy all of this. If we support farms in order to help America, let's support small farms that actually help it.

Clearly your way isn't working, and it has been given 50 years. Remember the definition of insanity. Furthermore, 99% of the world, as you correctly point out, believe sanctions are a bad idea. Hmmm...

It's a sad day when it's perfectly legal to burn the US flag, the Bible, effigies of unpopular political characters, but not the Koran. Muslims need to learn that Islam is just another religion with no greater status or legal protection than any other religion. If they don't like it they should move to repressive countries in the Middle East that live, work and think about 1000 years behind the West. They're free to leave. They are not free to impinge on Americans' right and liberties. Unlike other countries, the US must never consider freedom of speech a negotiable right, protected for some and not others.

Those who are dishonest enough to make a case that the wealthy and corporations don't have a responsibility to the commonwealth of the country do not deserve a forum.
921;7045;soda tax;1;0;to be a good citizen person get rid of something in control;the intention of the tweet towards'soda tax' is to criticize it as an overreach of government control and an attack on individual freedom of choice.;Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school;Is there any other substance whose legal status is dependent upon ALL users to be completely responsible upstanding citizens? Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school shootings consumed it. Fortunately, due to Bloomberg's attempts to just limit sizes, I know that the American Beverage Association would be there to remind us that it's not about protecting us from ourselves, but about our choices as Americans! It's not just alcohol that gets a different standard, it's literally everything that's not cannabis.

These habits may help one to resist impulse & convenience buying of fast food & snacks. The food-industrial complex will always be with us but we can learn healthy habits to defend against their marketing.

I think this ignores the larger point, which is that hand-written print is largely dead outside of school. Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or grammatical structure is wasted in my opinion. Today's students are not going to write on the job. They're going to use a computer. And if anything we should be spending *more* time teaching them to use said computer instead of learning how to write things long hand--a skill which they will never use.
924;16633;doctor's care;1;0;to know what do learn about the disease be informed more;the intention of the tweet is to express dissatisfaction with the quality of care received from medical doctors and suggest that veterinarians provide better care.;I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk;"Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets."
925;16978;capital gains;1;0;to be fair everyone others all fair.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gains' is to argue against the proposed tax rate of 15% on capital gains, stating that it diminishes society's value of work and creates more debt.;charging 15% for capital gains, or less, as has been proposed, diminishes society';All income should be taxed the same. It shouldn't matter how the money got there. I can imagine that capital gains might be adjusted for inflation. Still, charging 15% for capital gains, or less, as has been proposed, diminishes society's value of work. Work creates concrete economic growth, manipulating money doesn't. At worst it just creates more debt.

The Cato Institute is funded by people who wish to denigrate and weaken government at every level. If they pay McCluskey's salary, it is because he is carrying their water. Parents who are not content with what their children may or may not be taught in public classrooms have always been free to home school or enroll them in private schools. Public education has been a smashing success story for America and tens of millions of its citizens. However, allowing individual parents to alter lesson plans at will can only result in chaos and a less-educated population. This New Hampshire experiment will end in failure.
927;6052;economic regulations;1;1;to make sure no one gets hurt everyone is on time save money be safe fair;the tweet argues for regulating in-flight conditions as matters of health and safety, and suggests regulating minimum pitch, seat width, and luggage space based on flight duration.;Airline deregulation was driven by the theory of contestable markets;Airline deregulation was driven by the theory of contestable markets. The theory doesn't work when there are no new or potential entrants, which seems to be the case today. Almost unnoticed, however, the Acela has reduced air travel between New York and Washington, DC by half. High-speed rail in other corridors will likely do the same. It is only a matter of time. Still, miserable in-flight conditions should be regulated as matters of health and safety. Minimum pitch (legroom), seat width, and luggage space, perhaps dependent on flight duration, should be considered. Passengers in seats without overhead luggage space (the last two rows in many 737s) should be permitted to check baggage without charge. And seats should be held for passengers who have unavoidably missed connections.
928;16207;for profit law schools;1;0;to get rid of them help the poor save money be a lawyer;criticize for-profit law schools.;The most obvious first step is for the government to stop insuring any loans to for profit;One of the biggest causes of the decline in the Bar pass rates is the spread of for-profit law schools. Their pass rates are always the lowest in the state and they have the highest default rate on loans. The most obvious first step is for the government to stop insuring any loans to for profit schools.

There are;Please show me the study that proves that vaccines are either safe or effective. There are no such studies, but there are many studies that cause me to question their safety, not to mention the thousands of cases of vaccine injury documented on the VAERS site. If vaccines are safe, why has our government given monetary compensation to thousands of vaccine injured families through the VICP program?

Correlation is not causation. I'd rather someone self-medicate with (preferrably legal) Marijuana. Prohibition makes hard drugs seem equivalent and risks making the gateway claims self-fulfilling. Robert Dupont, MD, from wikipedia: He claims that marijuana is ""the most dangerous drug"",[11] a claim that is at odds with current scientific consensus.[12] He served as a paid consultant for Straight, Incorporated, a ""controversial non-profit drug rehabilitation program"" for youth that was the subject of numerous allegations of abuse and which was successfully sued for false imprisonment and maltreatment.[13]"

Hepatitis B? HPV? Be my guest--that choice only affects your family, because those are not diseases your kid can spread at school, on the bus, etc. But no one without a medical exemption should be able to opt out of vaccinations against HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, very dangerous diseases like German measles, pertussis/whooping cough, mumps (which can leave little boys permanently infertile), etc. Measles can live on surfaces like classroom desks and the metal handles people hold in buses for several hours. Nobody has the right to expose complete strangers to devastating diseases that are so easy to prevent.
932;21081;dual citizenship;1;2;to be the best a teacher successful respected;the author intends to express frustration with the university system, arguing that it prioritizes faculty publications over teaching underprepared students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds.;I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people;The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.
933;20479;status teacher;1;2;to know what do is wrong the truth be informed;the intention of the tweet towards'status teacher' is to express the importance of medical education and awareness in understanding the limitations of the internet and the importance of seeking professional medical advice.;I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient;I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies.

It just;"""...Facebook gets a bad rap; it didn't cause the cheating. It just made it more convenient to do (and perhaps easier to catch)."" Hmm, call me crazy, but Facebook shares some of the responsibility -- does it not? It's like refusing to assign blame to gun dealers and drug dealers. They increase accessibility to illicit materials, which essentially furthers the end goal of usage. Now, this isn't to suggest that Facebook is entirely at fault, but it does play an active role."

Starting so early so there is enough daylight for a sports programs? That's why today so many of our graduates (?) are only good for sports programs... I am now 63, with 3 degrees from an ivy league school, and having run my own business for over 30 years and having had 100s of employees. I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep. Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally. Public schools shouldn't begin before 9:00 am. Period. Then we'll have better performing students and workers. Guaranteed. And don't tell

It isn't that rich candidates are less corrupt - they've merely cut out the middleman.

The experience of higher education in this country is profoundly gender;And yet not a single writer in this series notes a fundamental irony: Despite the declining number of young men and women who express interest in attending a single-sex college, thousands of these same women and men every year enter co-educational institutions, then immediately set about segregating themselves: from men- and women-only dorms to sports teams to fraternities and sororities. Let's not fool ourselves. The experience of higher education in this country is profoundly gendered, no matter how much some of these contributors would like us to believe otherwise.

Most of the people I know who did not get a chance to be children lack a sense of joy in their lives and have a sense of sadness or rigidity about them.

The gross immorality of modern war--war since Napoleon if not earlier--is that contestants are willing to kill for their cause, but not to die for it. The US killed far more people in Iraq than the 4000 or so Americans who fell there--the ratio seems to be tending toward thousands of civilians versus 0 soldiers. The drone makes the perfect war: they die (we don't know who), we live."
940;14588;educational need;1;2;to be a good teacher help the poor poor. person;the intention of the tweet is to acknowledge that not all parts of the educational system in the u.s. are broken, but only those that serve the poor are, and suggest that mr. canada's suggestion might be necessary for the schools he oversees. the tweet also suggests that most schools don't have the same problems and a longer school day might not be necessary for them. the tweet emphasizes the need to bridge the achievement gap by bringing the bottom up.;Mr. Canada's suggestion might well be necessary for the schools he oversees;Aron (#36) is right. Not every part of the educational system here in the U.S. is broken. Only those parts that serve the poor are broken. Mr. Canada's suggestion might well be necessary for the schools he oversees. But most schools don't have the same problems, and for them a longer school day seems unnecessary. To bridge the achievement gap, we need to bring the bottom up. The top is for the most part where it ought to be.
941;8712;right to work;1;1;to be free free. express his opinion protest;the intention of the tweet towards target 'right to work' is to clarify that while the government protects freedom of speech, employers may still choose to fire employees for certain activities, even if they are done outside of work hours.;Salam Al-Marayati would be well in his rights. Sharia;#10 has stated the facts. Any firm --even a quasi-government firm--- can release anyone for any reason at anytime except the reasons he has mentioned, Wake up, employees, the government protects your freedom of speech. You can't be arrested for burning the Koran, Bible, Torah, flag, effigies of anyone --as long as it's not considered to be a build up to a physical threat. HOWEVER, your employer may choose to fire you for any of these reasons although these activities are done outside of the work day. There is no recourse. Salam Al-Marayati would be well in his rights. Shariah law has nothing to do with this.
942;15724;school librarians;1;1;to be helpful helpful. help the students children learn;the user's intention is to express concern about the lack of funding for schools, particularly for technology and libraries, and to advocate for the importance of librarians in helping children find books.;I hope our librarian remains to help children find books;If school budgets are so tight as to require elimination of librarians, from where -- pray tell -- will the money to buy computers for Internet access appear? Our public elementary school in Brooklyn, NY has hardly any computers. There isn't even one for students to use in our library to access our partially-automated card catalog, so I hope our librarian remains to help children find books.
943;21810;walmart;1;2;to make money get rich earn save;the user criticizes banks for prioritizing fines and gambling over customer service, and suggests re-introducing a government-run postal savings system with expanded loan authority to provide a more sustainable banking model.;Walmart is a monopoly;This problem didn't just arrive with recent regulation. Long ago banks started to look towards fining their customers as a way of making money. This was accompanied by deceptive practices used to maximize the amercable events ergo some of the regulations. Indeed hitting upon fines as a profit center coincided with discovering that gambling with the free money customers provided was more profitable than providing services to customers and the community - like making loans. We all know how that ended. Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans.

That's worth it! So I'll have a luxurious meal when I touch down, and still have $430 left over to spend on myself.

I know AC is a huge power user, so I really doubt electrics have any but..... for those who don't know, sitting in a car in South Florida in the summer will cause you to melt without AC .

You may be willing to arrive with your blouse/shirt totally soaked and stuck to your back as you charge into the office, but what about your collegues ?
946;17396;noncompete deals;1;0;to get a better job raise. deal raise;the intention of the tweet towards noncompete deals is to argue that they are reasonable protection for both sides, but also suppress wages and create a sense that employees are property of their employers.;Employees should be free to move or sell their talents to the highest bidder;Employees should be free to move or sell their talents to the highest bidder. A time restricted none compete that's enforced through compensation by the former employer who wishes to restrict the employee seems like reasonable protection for both sides. The employee can't work for a year or two in their most lucrative field but the employer who wishes to restrict them pays them a portion of their lost wages for the period of enforcement. A free market for goods and services includes labor. A none compete does more than protect intellectual property it suppresses wages and creates a sense that the employee is property of the employer if they wish to stay in the field were they have the most experience and potential value.
947;2183;current students' attitudes;1;0;to be a good teacher professor make point understand the situation;the intention of the tweet towards current students' attitudes is to express concern about the perceived decline in intelligence and critical reasoning skills among young people.;Unless you count ability to distinguish between Manolo and Jimmy Choo shoes, we;As a prof for 34 years, people ask me whether students are getting dumber or smarter. That would be very hard to quantify even with the most sophisticated measurement instruments. Empirically (that means observations done more or less scientifically) I see that there are still those that have it (intelligence, critical reasoning, a thirst for readiing, cognitive complexity) and those who don't (or just don't care). Additionally, most of us profs notice that there is a huge gap between those haves and have nots and that there is a huge gulf of mediocrity in our young people and citizenry. Unless you count ability to distinguish between Manolo and Jimmy Choo shoes, we are definitely becoming dumber. But remember, most of our empiricism is done at the local tavern.
948;17923;mideast peace;1;1;to be in power a leader control destroy the country gain;the tweet expresses a negative view towards the arab league and its actions towards israel, suggesting that any attempts at peace in the middle east are futile.;Arab League has forbidden Abbas to recognize the Jewish state. Arabs showed clearly that their goal;Arab League has forbidden Abbas to recognize the Jewish state. Arabs showed clearly that their goal is not a peace, but a destruction of Israel. About what can Israel speak with Arabo-fascists? About a destruction of Israel? Pandering to the Arab aggressors and sacrificing the tiny Israel contradicts the moral values of the West.
949;17200;public schools;1;1;to teach the kids help children be responsible;the intention of the tweet towards public schools is to argue against tax breaks for home schooling, stating that public schools provide important functions beyond education and their expenses have to be paid.;the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid;Who has the time? When the kids are are of school age, the parents - usually both - have their noses to the grindstone. It takes a lot of determination and endurance to sit Junior down for two hours of lessons right after dinner. Further, as degrading as it may seem, schools provide an important function beyond education - as a day care service permitting both parents to be employed. As to the merits of giving tax breaks for home schooling, the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid. Home schooling certainly means higher taxes.

It didn't work before, and it won't work now. Corporations are awash in cash but they aren't creating jobs (and after all, corporations are people, right?). Giving corporations more cash isn't going to change that.

Moderate rebels? Seriously? Just because the Rebels opposing the Syrian Democratic Forces are backed by Turkey does that make them moderate? The Kurdish led coalition with Arabs and Syriac-Assyrians want to create a secular democracy within the borders of an autonomous region in a land otherwise ruled by terror. Is that such a bad thing? The whole point of war is to seize territory from those that are trying to kill you. Always has been all ways will. Two years ago the Kurds were almost pushed outside the borders of Syria and faced genocide, they will not let that happen again. I see you are a writer for Ak am Dail which is a Turk Government publication. I was going to take this piece seriously but I think your credentials speak for themselves.

Now they just want to shake me down for every last farthing. Shame on them. They will be made to change and the sooner the better.
953;487;israel;1;0;to be a good person left alone free independent;the user expresses criticism of unquestioning us support for israel's likud party and aipac's influence on us foreign policy, advocating for transparency and justice in israel-palestine peace efforts.;Modern Israel is an apartheid state and should be shunned until they;The problem is not US support for Israel- it is the unquestioning support for the Likudniks and instant vilification of anyone who questions or criticizes anything the Israeli government decides to do that is the problem. AIPAC needs to be flushed out and shown to the bright sunshine which should greatly weaken it's undue influence in our politics. A speck of a country the size of a county in most US states should not be the tail wagging the dog in Mideast policy. I want Israeli politics out of US foreign policy and I am not alone. I do not wish any ill upon the people or nation of Israel, but am tired of AIPAC undue influence in our foreign policy. There will be no lasting peace in the Israel until all parties see justice done. The Likudniks have no intention of brokering an honest and just peace with the Palestinian people nor respecting their rights of property. Modern Israel is an apartheid state and should be shunned until they come to their senses.
954;5333;big banks;1;0;to be in charge control make money the best money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'big banks' is to criticize their management practices and suggest that they prioritize their own profits over the well-being of the economy.;The banks are in the business of using the US economy to make money;The banks are in the business of using the US economy to make money. Usually this is good for both the banks and the rest of the economy, but sometimes the banks make it much more beneficial for them than for the economy. The best managed companies on the planet will be the ones that can extort the most from everybody else by getting rid of fair competition on a level playing field. Like a well-managed army, they are aggressive as well as efficient. The banks need to be managed so that they do not drown in their own bubbles, but also so they do not take over the rest of the economy.

Remember they are the important ones who provide for everyone else. The remainder of our population should be busy working and not spending their time unproductively on things like going to the beach or parks with their families.

""Seems""? I don't recall people twenty years ago saying that the cure for unwanted pregnancy was to ban contraception. Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our ""smart bombs"" and ""smart phones"" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves ""by accident"" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago. I seriously doubt that even the average person's knowledge of basic geography is better today than that of my grandparents."

What he burned was nothing more;"I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol"", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: ""please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone."""
959;15583;federal;1;1;to be in power charge a leader fair;the intention of the tweet towards target 'federal' is to criticize the federal government's handling of felon disenfranchisement laws.;Isn't federalism wonderful. States can be laboratories for democracy,...;Isn't federalism wonderful. States can be laboratories for democracy, ... except when they do something judged inappropriate. Can we expect Roger Clegg and his friends to take up the fight to deny felons the votes in Maine and Vermont, which do not disenfranchise their felons at all, or in the states that re-enfranchise their felon on release from prison. More importantly, it's time to ensure that the census counts incarcerated felons at their place of last residence rather than their prison? Counting the incarcerated at their prisons boosts the legislative representation of the prison areas at the expense of the prisoners' real neighborhoods.
960;4523;prostituiont;1;1;to be a leader make change difference safe;the intention of the tweet is to argue against legalizing prostitution, stating that it leads to an increase in trafficking.;any change in the legal framework on prostitution leads to an increase in trafficking;I think the evidence shows that any change in the legal framework on prostitution leads to an increase in trafficking. For example, South Korea's tougher new prostitution laws saw an increase in women being trafficked - ouf of the country.
961;6265;teachers;1;1;to be the best a teacher respected successful;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the idea that younger, enthusiastic teachers are always better than seasoned veterans.;My best teachers, at all stages of my education, were all seasoned veterans;I'm a professor and am a MUCH better teacher in year seven than I was in years 1-5. My colleagues feel the same. The argument for younger, enthusiastic teachers might make sense in certain isolated cases, but experience counts much more. My best teachers, at all stages of my education, were all seasoned veterans.
962;4897;predictable salary;1;0;to get a raise make money. money be generous paid;the intention of the tweet towards target 'predictable salary' is to argue for a salary-based system rather than relying on tipping.;I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy.;I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you.
963;18353;automation in farming;1;0;to make money. get a job money save;the author's intention is to promote the use of automation in farming as a long-term solution, and to allocate resources towards the development of robots for this purpose.;Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs;Only Karina Gallardo mentioned automation. The importation of farm laborers will increase our population and only temporarily provide farm laborers. Hopefully, the children of the farm laborers will be educated and find better jobs. The use of imported farm laborers should only be considered a temporary solution. An alternative needs to be sought. This means that a significant amount of money must be allocated to the development of robots to do the picking. Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs. They also may have better ability to detect the ripeness and quality of crops plants. Robots have the advantage of being able to sense light outside of the visible range and to be equipped with ultrasonic and other sensors. One potential benefit of a decrease in defense spending is that some very qualified members of the defense industry could be motivated to work on farm automation. Some medical imaging companies probably have relevant technology.
964;7444;driving priviliges;1;0;to be a good driver safe safe. save lives;the intention of the tweet towards target 'driving privileges' is to advocate for criminalizing cars immediately.;Once children start driving they get addcted, doing it almost every day for the rest of;Using Evans' logic we should make criminalize cars immediately. Once children start driving they get addcted, doing it almost every day for the rest of their lives. They get irritable when driving privileges are taken away from them. And the danger ! We have plenty of research and $$$ have been spent on drunk driving education, yet people still drive drunk ! This is a crisis that can only be solved by throwing people in jail.

Oh wait, that is our current law. Silly me. But really, why not let industry settle on the coast and let the market decide just what it can dump into the waters that wash up next door in public lands and residential areas? Oh wait, we do that too. I guess you've already won, dude.
966;10685;vaccine;1;1;to save lives be healthy avoid disease safe;the intention of the tweet is to argue against anti-vaccination sentiment and emphasize the importance of vaccination in protecting children from serious diseases.;Both the child and the rest of the population have a right to be protected against Communic;Both the child and the rest of the population have a right to be protected against Communicable diseases that can result in Deafness, blindness, paralysis, mental retardation and death. Newborns, immune-compromised adults, and the unvaccinated are protected by herd immunity. If all parents decided to forgo vaccination for their children, our infant and child mortality rates would soar. By the way, Breast feeding has no protective value against tetanus, diphtheria, measles, or whooping cough.
967;17012;fees;1;0;to get out of debt the rid save money be safe;criticizes high fees imposed by banks and financial institutions.;With the rates imposed and fees added you'd think you were dealing with loan sharks;This mess began more than 30 years ago when the government did away with the usury laws. Since then it's been open season on bank customers. With the rates imposed and fees added you'd think you were dealing with loan sharks. So far the only difference is that nobody drops by your house to break your knee caps if you overdraw your checking account, miss a payment, or move your money to a credit union. We need to reimpose caps above which no money lender or financial institution can impose fees, interest, or any other charges or fines.
968;16003;government intervention;1;0;to be in charge control a leader helpful;the author's intention towards government intervention is to criticize the unstated objectives of universal pre-school programs, which prioritize getting women in the workforce over the role of parents in child care and education.;I would hate to see a society where all of our decisions belong to the government and parents;The problems with universal pre-school are the unstated objectives of the program. First, most people are sympathetic when children have parents who can't or won't care for them, but the objective of the program is to get women in the workforce - out of the home. This applies even when they can stay home or want to stay home. Secondly, the responsibility of child care and education belongs to the government, with parents assisting only. I would hate to see a society where all of our decisions belong to the government and parents and families have only a secondary role. A sad future that far too many people blindly accept and embrace.
969;21303;high school;1;2;to have a family be parent child mother children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'high school' is to express frustration about the societal pressure on young women to become mothers, while also acknowledging the role of men in this issue.;I wouldn't have minded having a child in my twenties, but;"Unfortunately, young motherhood these days often means single motherhood. I wouldn't have minded having a child in my twenties, but there are few men in their twenties who want to get married, let alone have kids at that age. Even though this issue is always portrayed as ""women are waiting to have children,"" men are waiting to have children too."
970;18982;medical websites;1;1;to be informed informed. know the options understand situation learn more;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to express gratitude and positive feedback for the helpful information found online during the author's cancer treatment.;I made very extensive use of the Google during my treatment;As a cancer survivor (14 years in remission after an aggressive lymphoma treated with Chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy) I am happy to say that I made very extensive use of the Google during my treatment. It obviously doesn't replace or 'outrank' my specialists, but I found it was a big help in educating me and filling in background info on my situation and the treatment options that were being recommended. I believe researching options online helped me to ask better questions and ultimately made me a lot more comfortable with the treatment plan my doctors recommended. In most cases, the information I found online agreed with what the docs were telling me. I found that to be very comforting because I didn't just feel like I was taking everything the docs said on blind faith and at face value. In at least 2 cases, the questions I asked did lead to changes in my treatment plan.
971;7961;hurricane;1;0;to be a good citizen neighbor in control charge free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'hurricane' is to criticize the damage caused by hurricanes and the cost of restoring beaches, which is borne by taxpayers.;When a hurricane hits and the beaches are damaged, it is the tax payer who pays to;When a hurricane hits and the beaches are damaged, it is the tax payer who pays to have the beaches restored. Why do beach house owners believe they can cut off access to a beach when it is the tax payers who pay to maintain it? If they refuse to allow access to the beach, and the local police departments ticket & tow cars parked on the street owned by out of towners using the beach, then the government should exercise eminent domain, kick the owners to the curb and raze the houses. The beach and the ocean belong to everyone, and everyone should have full and free access. FREE access. Don't get me started on towns that have the nerve to charge a fee to allow people the privilege of sticking their toes in the sand. That is absurd, too.

Just about all of the population growth results;Yes, America needs to get its house in order. Our population is growing by about 30 million per decade!!! Just about all of the population growth results from immigration. So let's reduce immigration and also focus on reducing consumption. Without reduced immigration all our environmental efforts to be more efficient and consume less are swamped and irrelevant.

It could be worse, they may want to do something really dumb like cut taxes even more or try to start another war. First of all they don't have the votes and under 8 years of Bush the problems just got worse.
974;21742;grade college;1;2;to be in control a leader charge power;the intention of the tweet towards 'grade college' is to encourage critical thinking and questioning of the israeli-iranian nuclear conflict.;i hate college;Israeli exceptionalism should be over So let me get this right, Israel can claim 'ambiguity' over nukes but Iran who is publicly stating 'we're not interested in nukes' is only good for a 'defensive' war started by yourselves? I've heard it all now. And as long as Israel defends nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage', Iran can also defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. So leave Iran alone as long as you allow Israel and any other country to defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. If the US and Israel want Iranian nuclear transparency, then Israel better be just as transparent.

The deep thinker that said tipping is anticapitalistic obviously did not think this through. What is more entrepeneurial then have to suceed or fail solely on your hard work, charm and guile.

Get scratching posts; claw covers; use a squirt bottle with water;...all the declawing is because people who aren't cat savvy feel that their furniture is more important OR they don't like the sound OR they are scratched playing with the cat. This is a barbaric procedure. Those who implement it on their animals are not even remotely interested in the cat...it's all about what THEY want.

They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause ""like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY. It's called ""being stoned""."
978;1860;obesity;1;0;to be healthy healthy. in control healthier.;the intention of the tweet is to challenge discrimination against obesity and advocate for a more nuanced approach to addressing the issue.;we should not discriminate in any manner against obesity;I was obese. Then, undergraduate school and white crosses changed that. I am aware that my opinion will be challenged, but we should not discriminate in any manner against obesity. Why? Because it's not the right way to treat people. All of the evidence presented in this debate is valid. Particularly that on the costs of our health and its burden on others. I do not believe that there is one obese person that would choose to remain obese if a miracle drug could return them to a normal weight. Obesity is a physical and an emotional nightmare. It eats at you (no pun intended) every hour of the day. We have irrefutable proof that it's thoroughly toxic, in every sense of the word. And yes, we should, as a people, be nutritionally sophisticated. Yet, we're not - we're nowhere near. But, by adopting many of these reforms and legislating stiff penalties, we are just going too far. Have we sunk so low that we are now to make laws and develop policies against the physique of our neighbor? The very thought is insane. There are better ways to solve this problem.

This seemed acceptable to me at the time, and when I left I changed fields entirely so it didn't actually matter.

I've had this argument with other anti-vaxxer parents, and they can't seem to get it through their skulls that the MAIN reason they don't HAVE to vaccinate their children-is be cause all the other responsible parents have already done so!!! They lack any understanding of what a social contract is or why it is necessary for civil life to continue, let alone the danger their sweet little child poses to people vulnerable to these diseases. Hey, why should I pay my taxes to pave my streets when all my neighbors have me covered on that one? Jeez

Because the Palestinians are not recognized by Israelis as being divinely created equal with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If America was treating Mexicans and Canadians the way Israel treats Palestinians then it should expect resistance and would deserve it. American revolutionaries used violence to gain their independence. Zionist Jews used violence to obtain their nation state.

But, sometimes he's not there, and so I see another physician in the clinic. And they may do something questionable for which I am grateful I can investigate using google."

It's funny how the domestic carriers are all for deregulation and increased competition in theory, but once outside foreign airlines are involved, they rely on what you rightfully point out is antiquated regulation. Fact is that Americans really only have a choice between four airlines for domestic travel and are subject to the whims of these companies. The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such. This means to be required to cooperate with certain regulations.

Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers.
987;10196;advice about eating well;1;1;to lose weight be healthy healthier eat;advice to gradually make small changes in diet for healthy eating.;One way Americans can change their diets is to do it ONE small step at a;One way Americans can change their diets is to do it ONE small step at a time. For example, I decided to drink green tea in the morning, instead of a coffee latte. Later, I decided to substitute iced water for soft drinks. Another change was whole wheat thin buns for sandwiches, instead of regular bread. Instead of yogurt with lots of calories and sugar, I now eat plain, non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with fresh fruits like blueberries or bananas. Each change was painless and over the years the weight melted away, until I reached a BMI number of 22. I think I would have been discouraged if I had tried to make all the changes in my diet at once. It would have seemed too hard.
988;7333;menu;1;0;to save money buy something eat;the user expresses frustration and feels deceived by a restaurant's misleading menu prices, indicating a negative dining experience.;It almost seems like the menu is part of a bait and switch operation;Amen. It almost seems like the menu is part of a bait and switch operation. That $32 osso bucco is not $32 as printed on the menu, it's $38. Dessert is not $8, it's $9.60. You can do the arithmetic on a bottle of wine. Your $120 check actually runs you $144. God forbid you take the whole family out.

They've gone into Syria multiple times bombed a moving target and came back home. They ACT. Why us, why now, why not the EU or NATO, or the Arab League??? No, Assad is done. He's vicious and deplorable. Appeal to the UN to give Israel the territory they already control, the Golan Heights. Appeal to the UN and possibly act with others, see above, to formally give the Kurds the State they already have control over; something the Europeans forgot about in the early 20th Century. Aid the Israelis and the Kurds, not Assad."

Burn an American flag, ok, rip up a photo of the Pope, ok, this is America. But deface a Koran and you are called out as an intolerant bigot. This is wrong on the face of it. And at the root is Islam's own intolerance. Strongly criticize their religion and they want to not just protest, but kill you. We need to stand up to this bullying. To the specific issue in this case, yes, fire the worker, if you also fire a worker who burns an America flag during an anti-war rally. Of course we know this wouldn't happen.

Do not do any thing to mess this up. It works well and will be the main reason why the US is ahead of the world in terms of technology , health care, weaponry etc. etc. Do not follow the path of the emerging market politicians who for the purposes of getting re-elected enact populist measures which at the end destroy successful institutions . Stay the course.
992;15921;hybrid cars;1;1;to have more options save money be efficient money.;the intention of this tweet is to promote open-mindedness towards alternative fuel vehicles, using the volt as an example, and to encourage the exploration of various technological solutions for car power.;I recall a lot of these same issues being brought up when the first hybrids were announced;While clearly the Volt is not perfect, I recall a lot of these same issues being brought up when the first hybrids were announced. Too expensive, not worth it, only die-hard environmentalists will buy them and lose money, etc. Yet today look at all the hybrids on the road. And the cost has come down. Is the Volt the answer to our car problems? Of course not. But maybe by starting to realize that gasoline isn't the only way to power a car, it'll lead to hydrogen-powered cars or fuel cells or who knows maybe a technology that doesn't even exist yet. More options are always better!
993;3633;schools' goals;1;1;to help the poor be a leader people succeed others;the intention of the tweet is to support the school's goal of providing vocational education that leads to high-paying jobs and improves students' lives.;"Mr. Hamed is exactly right when he says, ""If our goal is to lift";"I'm all for broad education. I'm a product of it. As a teacher and professor I spent my professional life in it,. And in my college planning practice, I've guided most of my students towards it. But Mr. Hamed is exactly right when he says, ""If our goal is to lift students from poverty to high-paying programming jobs, this school's curriculum is admirable."" It may or may not produce the next Steve Jobs - we can argue about how geniuses arise some other time - but good vocational education lifts students who otherwise might flounder and founder into jobs that provide them with pride, stability and a good living. I wish more schools did as much."
994;18288;home schooling;1;2;to get a good education be parent job citizen person;the intention of the tweet towards target 'home schooling' is to argue against the idea that home schooling parents should not have to pay for schools they don't use, and to emphasize the importance of education for everyone.;Home schooling parents shouldn't have to pay for schools they don't use then pay;"""The sentiment is right: Home schooling parents shouldn't have to pay for schools they don't use then pay again for education they do."" The sentiment is completely wrong. Everyone should pay for education because everyone benefits from an educated population. I have no children in school today, but when I need a nurse or doctor in 30 years where will they come from if not from children my tax dollars are educating today? The question of how best to achieve high quality schools is another debate entirely. But the need for them is irrefutable."

We need to protect ourselves from these devices - not develop them to be used against us some day... I'm sure we'll see a story soon about a driver-less car or pilot-less plane used to harm innocents in the homeland that created these high-tech marvels.
996;20152;grade college;1;2;to win the war be in power a leader control charge;the intention of the tweet towards 'grade college' is to provide a nuanced perspective on the syrian conflict and suggest a diplomatic solution.;Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who;Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible.
997;9773;domestic airline competition;1;1;to be a good citizen able travel fly in control charge;criticizes domestic airlines for opposing foreign airlines on domestic routes and advocates for increased regulation.;The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such. This means;Allowing foreign airlines to serve domestic routes is definitely something that doesn't get brought up enough. It's funny how the domestic carriers are all for deregulation and increased competition in theory, but once outside foreign airlines are involved, they rely on what you rightfully point out is antiquated regulation. Fact is that Americans really only have a choice between four airlines for domestic travel and are subject to the whims of these companies. The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such. This means to be required to cooperate with certain regulations.

Nor in the interest of Mossad, Shin Bet, Israel Defense Force, Likud and the Israel Lobby including AIPAC. But it would be in the interest of 6 million Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians living under occupation, blockade/siege, exile and 2nd class citizenship beneath and beholden to 6.1 million Zionist Israeli Jews.

A few children, lucky to be in those classes, may benefit but how does it benefit the school as a whole? And what does it do for the morale of the regular teaching staff, many of whom may be wonderful, dedicated teachers to have these neophytes who come with a label of special, gifted drop into their schools as though manna from heaven? Finally, do these special, gifted new teachers have some kind of solution for the poverty and other conditions that surely have at least, if not more, to do with the condition of their schools and their academic achievement than does the ability of the teacher? Can they magically help the parent who doesn't have the education to help or encourage the child? Can they promise these kids that if they work hard and do well, they will have a better life?

Flat-earthers and their ilk with flaky, religious-based conclusions should not be given air time in any discussion of scientific facts.
1001;5604;phd degrees;1;1;to get a degree be the best job scientist successful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'phd degrees' is to highlight the legacy of women's colleges in promoting graduate school opportunities for women in physical sciences.;My school actively promoted me going on to graduate school;I have a PhD in a physical science and received my undergraduate degree at a women's college as did most women of my generation with a degree in a physical science. My school actively promoted me going on to graduate school. 100% of the women my senior class in chemistry went on to graduate school. This is the legacy of a women's college. The women who went to co-ed institutions told stories of harassment in the classroom and labs and found it difficult to obtain letters of recommendation let alone counseling and active support. Men in my graduate school were given forms for grants and scholarships while women were told they were a lost cause as the expectation was that they would soon marry and drop out. I don't think times have changed that much as I'm still one of a handful of women in my field and I'm not seeing a younger generation of women participating. BTW, I went to Mt. Holyoke College.
1002;140;restaurant owners being in favour of tipping;1;1;to make money. get a raise be generous. generous money;the intention of the tweet is to argue against restaurant owners being in favor of tipping.;The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense;It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.
1003;21540;technological innovation;1;2;to enjoy a meal the flight eat something travel;the user is expressing satisfaction and value perception of modern air travel's cost efficiency compared to the 1970s, despite minor comfort sacrifices.;flying from coast to coast (5 hours) for $500 cheaper than in the 1970s;If I'm flying from coast to coast (5 hours) for $500 cheaper than in the 1970s, the airline is essentially paying me $100 an hour to sit in slightly cramped conditions eating my own sandwich. That's worth it! So I'll have a luxurious meal when I touch down, and still have $430 left over to spend on myself.
1004;19103;israel;1;1;to be in control make a point power charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'israel' is to criticize the author's stance on boycotting israel and to question their understanding of the real issue.;it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse;Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use. Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening.
1005;11469;religion preventing medical care;1;0;to protect others. others help people;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the separation of religion from medical care.;People should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on others when it would harm or;People should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on others when it would harm or endanger others. Parents should not be able to deprive their children of medical care, like vaccinations, and employers should not be able to deny their employees of medical care, like contraception.
1006;10688;pot;1;1;to get away from something rid of high. high;the user is expressing skepticism about dr. evins' statistics on marijuana, sharing their personal experience of using marijuana without becoming addicted, and emphasizing its temporary cognitive impairment effects.;I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily;"I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause ""like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY. It's called ""being stoned""."
1007;7969;counterargument to doing away with tipping and increasing prices;1;1;to get a better service good deal be in control;the intention of the tweet is to argue against doing away with tipping and increasing prices, and instead to advocate for a system where customers have more control over their dining experience.;you're going to be paying 18% more. either way. why would you not want;every once in awhile, there will be a newspaper article about restaurants and tipping. the people who never once worked in a restaurant scream for business owners to pay us a living wage. so in theory that would be adding let's say...18% to all the items on the menu to compensate for the waitstaff''s wages. so honestly.....you're going to be paying 18% more. either way. why would you not want to be in control of your 18%? you would all be screaming if you received horrible service from a waiter who had no incentive to do a proper job taking care of you, and no recourse as your tip could not reflect your disappointment. i know everyone's answer will be complaining to mgt. but you'll still be minus that 18%
1008;3107;who are vegans;1;1;to be healthy live longer healthier long;the intention of the tweet is to argue that veganism is not a healthy lifestyle despite its association with increased life expectancy.;The fact that vegans aren't healthier--and may even be significantly less healthy;Vegans are disproportionately female, white, liberal, highly educated, active, and wealthy. All six of these factors dramatically increase life expectancy. Moreover, vegans are especially careful about what they eat and pay much more attention to nutrition than ordinary Americans. They are far more likely to eat organic vegetables and far less likely to eat fries and hostess cupcakes. And then there's the fact that unhealthy lifestyles like smoking or veganism tend to lead to weight loss, which masks many of the health effects. If veganism had no health effects whatsoever, we would expect vegans to live much longer and be much, much healthier. The fact that vegans aren't healthier--and may even be significantly less healthy--means that veganism is probably a pretty unhealthy lifestyle.
1009;5264;athlete;1;0;to get a good job better degree be independent;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'athlete' is to suggest that athletes should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes, but should have access to certain kinds of academic support.;Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for;The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise.

Even in the Deep South, less than 4% of the population owned a slave. And, history shows that amongst the Southern slave owners were Blacks and African Americans. When one considers that most of the wealth generated by the industrial revolution occurred in the slave free North, it's hard to agree with the author's statement that ""...much of the wealth enjoyed by"" the US was gained through the slave trade. Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US. It would make as much sense for African Americans to seek reparations from the West African kingdoms that captured the slaves and sold them to European slavers."

Documentation and periodic reviews might help identify the best of those policies and make adjustments for the good of all involved.
1012;13271;school;1;1;to be smart intelligent smarter learn something;the intention of the tweet towards'school' is to criticize the emphasis on intellectual relativism in education and argue for a more practical and field-specific approach to learning.;There is far too much intellectual relativism being discussed in this thread;"There is far too much intellectual relativism being discussed in this thread. What was once considered to be valuable to intelligence is not exactly the same now. We need to get over this idea of ""well, my kids do not even know all the state capitals!"" Of course they don't. There is no need to know something off the top of your head in an age when you can look it up instantly. The information that is ""vital"" to a person's intelligence is directly related to what they need to know to function well in their field. I teach English, I know nothing about welding. A welder may know very little about literature. Is one of us smarter than the other?"
1013;11346;overweight;1;2;to be healthy lose weight healthier fit;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration and disappointment towards not being able to achieve a desired weight despite following a healthy lifestyle.;I would be labeled a high medical risk for 'failing to be thin;My pursuit of my 'right weight' also includes a daily cardio & weightlifting routine, cycling (18-20 miles a trip), hiking (6-10 miles) and the like when I'm not in the gym, visits with my physician, a nutritionist (confirming my already stellar diet) and an endocrinologist. And here I sit still, @ a 35 BMI. There are nights I've cried myself to sleep, exhausted and sore while my body mocks my attempts to reach my 'right' BMI. And while I will likely never, ever get there, I take comfort in my fitness. Yes, FITNESS. My blood sugars are stellar, my cholesterol good, blood pressure low and resting heart rate my doctor's envy. Are all obese people this way? Of course not. But as discussed now, I would be labeled a high medical risk for 'failing to be thin' and fair game for discrimination. Tell me how these things would apply to ME, oh sage ones who think everyone is fat because they want to be.
1014;18410;peace corps;1;1;to help the poor be a leader helpful people;the intention of the tweet towards peace corps is not stated.;we should view Peace Corps volunteers as a threat to the developing world;According to this perspective, we should view Peace Corps volunteers as a threat to the developing world, Meals on Wheels as a threat to the culinary arts, and AmeriCorps as a threat to the United States. Teach for America is a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and urban schools, which pre-date the existence of this program by decades. The reactionary response from educators who have failed to improve the educational achievement of underserved students only reinforces the need for something new and innovative. No one pretends that TFA is THE solution to public education, but at least it's focused in a tangible way on the places with the greatest needs.

Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school shootings consumed it. Fortunately, due to Bloomberg's attempts to just limit sizes, I know that the American Beverage Association would be there to remind us that it's not about protecting us from ourselves, but about our choices as Americans! It's not just alcohol that gets a different standard, it's literally everything that's not cannabis.
1016;15872;schoold;1;1;to be a leader teach his kids children helpful them;the intention of the tweet towards'schoold' is to criticize the school system and suggest that it is not producing world leaders.;Don't stress my kids with this utopian idea - send your own kids to summer;The current school day/year was good enough for us and its good enough for our kids. Why are so many people still pointing to Europe or Japan as if they are producing the world leaders? They are not. The technology you are using now to read this all came from right here from americans like Steve Jobs who fortunately had their summers off to dream and play and learn some thing on their own. Don't stress my kids with this utopian idea - send your own kids to summer school.
1017;13369;having children;1;1;to be a parent have child family responsible save money;the intention of the tweet is to persuade the target to have children earlier rather than later due to the current state of public schools and the potential risks of raising a child with autism or special needs.;the current make-up of our public schools;To me the most compelling reason to have children earlier rather than later, if possible, is the current make-up of our public schools. I have over 20 years teaching experience from 3rd grade through high school and GED programs. The correlation of older parents and the rise of autism and general growth of special education would be more than enough for me to hurry my decision to have children if in a committed relationship. The longer you wait, the higher your risks. If you think raising healthy children is challenging, imagine your day is 24/7 caring for a human being who will never be able to take care of him or herself, as you enter what should be the retirement/relaxing stage of life. It's no wonder we are blaming our schools and teachers for our educational failures, who wants to look in the mirror anymore?
1018;13360;getting full use of federal aid;1;1;to be a good citizen teacher responsible fair;the intention of the tweet is to hold institutions accountable for the use of federal aid and to ensure a minimum degree of achievement.;Why throw good money into institutions that have a high dropout rate;"The government has a right to expect some measure of a return on the billions paid to institutions in the form of federal aid. Educators should be expected to be held accountable for some minimum degree of achievement from all the federal dollars they receive. Why throw good money into institutions that have a high dropout rate. We need to force these institutions to have ""some skin in the game"" as this will force colleges to have a stake in a students outcome."
1019;18497;nutritional deficiency of veganism;1;0;to be healthy healthy. not sick eat;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the idea that humans are designed to be strict plant eaters and to highlight the nutritional deficiencies of a vegan diet.;If we were meant to be vegans, we would not need to supplement our diets with;Go, Nina! After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. As a Naturopathic Doctor with years of clinical and research experience, I have a sound understanding of human nutrition. The bottom line is that there exists no sound argument that humans are designed to be strict plant eaters. In fact, everything from our teeth to the other end of our digestive tract suggests that we are, and have always been, omnivores. If we were meant to be vegans, we would not need to supplement our diets with the various nutrients that a vegan diet is deficient in.
1020;13980;heroin;1;1;to make a point get high. be doctor high;the intention of the tweet towards target 'heroin' is to refute the idea that it is a gateway drug, and to criticize the doctors who perpetuate this misconception.;I'll bet most heroin users drank milk as children. Does that make it;I'll bet most heroin users drank milk as children. Does that make it a gateway drug? This type of nonsense has been around for the last 50 years or more. It's never been right and it never will be despite how many times it's repeated by rich, out of touch, old doctors who contributed to the problem in the first place. They are the problem, not cannabis.
1021;6736;veganism;1;1;to be healthy not eat meat healthy. food;the intention of the tweet is to argue that veganism is not feasible for everyone, and that it depends on various factors such as location, access to resources, and personal circumstances.;Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Sib;A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot.

After all, Alexander II did end serfdom back in 1861. With these ridiculous conditions still enforceable, we've yet to do so. Doesn't this make you proud to be an American?
1023;19616;fifa;1;2;to win the game be best play a;the user is comparing the style and strategy of basketball between the past and present, expressing nostalgia for the team-oriented play and physicality of the 1957 league, and criticizing modern individualistic play and rule changes.;The game I grew up with and today's game are very different;"The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3"" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk."

That can be done with non-;Non-compete clauses are not about protecting proprietary information. That can be done with non-disclosure agreements. What they're really about is inhibiting the free market for labor. Employers use non-compete clauses to discourage employees from leaving. That saves the employer the cost and trouble of training a new worker, and it keeps wages down by restricting the employee's ability to leave if he or she does not get a raise. Non-compete clauses should be banned as a simple matter of fairness, and because competition for labor makes companies better.

I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that.

That tuition cap limits college spending to whatever the public is willing to invest. But it does not change the cost of college, or what institutions actually spend per student."" Yes it does... you can't spend more than you have, just a simple fact. Public education would likely be cheaper on a per student basis than the private version. Classes would be larger, dorms less nice, with less landscaping on the lawns. I don't think that's necessarily bad. I think the current system is actually the worst of all worlds - a loan and financial aid system that effectively allows colleges to charge each student the absolute maximum of what they're able to pay, with public subsidies helping increase the price further."

I was graduated with honors when I received my Master of Arts degree. I learned more outside of school than I ever learned inside, at least once I learned to read. School tends to be boring for both very intelligent students and not very smart kids. Textbooks are dull. The books in the library and the stores are interesting. Has anybody but me noticed that, although students in other countries score higher than Americans on standardized tests, innovation still comes out of America? Long schools days only take away from dreaming, creating, and inventing. Go ahead and make school days longer--if you want a bunch of robots for citizens.

It buys great medical care, great dental care and great dinners. I come from the land of Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon and I can see myself buying a table at the last minute but if I don't care when I eat there then I will simply wait for an OpenTable or call. But then again our restaurants tend to be on the smaller size more petite size. Sometimes it take being a Chef to get into some of them.

(That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise.

They also free up U.S.-based jobs for other Americans. Do you really want hundreds of thousands of Americans coming back at the same time, all looking for U.S.-based jobs, because you took away their right to work in other countries? It's a big economic hit for nothing more than xenophobia.

This process is broken because excess world capacity in labor and off shore productivity is sopping up all of the spending and the banks are putting their investment in risk fee bonds. Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)? This plan encourages saving by U.S. citizens (the kind that breath), retains jobs and spending on U.S. soil, and the increased productive enhancement realized by such projects remain in the U.S..

None would forego their cut -- and the retailer gets the largest share of that. Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects. If more people could employ themselves on farms, we might have a better outcome. But our incentives are not set up to promote that. Correct the incentives. We don't need more factory farms.

It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.

It's the problem;Nope. I, a male, taught at an all girls high school in the 1970s. Then and now I realized what same sex education gives young women, and it ain't rocket science (although that certainly should be prominent in the curriculum). What these smart, no-nonsense young women learn is to EXPECT to be taken seriously, expect to compete on a equal basis with those around them, expect to get the prize when they actually win. Getting along with the boys is not the solution for the girls. It's the problem, friend, it's the problem.

It is most important to teach respect for others, particularly fellow students who are there to learn not to be disrupted and distracted by this sort of thing.

There can be great satisfaction by doing it in a conscious manner, not by taking the day to day events as inconveniences to be ignored and letting the nature of physically growing be the only achievement.

The object is to let the child learn how to be happy by experiencing and then discussing. If achievement of any kind makes the heart glow, that is where the child will go.

When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network.

If a college student is already proficient in two or more languages, then by all means let them study poetry or science or whatever else grabs them. But no US college graduate today should be monolingual since understanding the people(s) of the world is of the utmost value for reasons both practical/geostragtegic and intrinsic.

This is standard advocacy talk- the illegal's do the work American's won't do/can't do, and her Georgia example where former convicts, hardly a representative population, were cited as evidence is typical of the distortions practiced by these advoctes. If the farmers want legal workers, then they should pay them a living wage, and Americans should pay the higher resulting prices for the food that they consume .The implication that American's are not hard workers is not borne out by our history.

The royal family needs to be taxed and pay their own bills like everyone else. Their decadent luxurious lifestyles are ludicous and outdated especially when the UK is facing severe austerity measures. William and Kate should pay for their own wedding. They are not indigent. The royals could make a fortune selling exclusive wedding photos to the tabloids. Personally, I cannot understand why couples live together before they get married when the research shows that they are more likely to become divorced than those couples who don't. I am old fashioned and think that marriage is a sacrament. I think that William and Kate are setting a bad example like all the other celebrities and other heterosexual people that are living together without being married.

On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because ""there's an American in the room"".

Scoring is down, even (especially) compared to the days before the shot clock. I dunno. Maybe they should LOWER the rim."

In an effort to make everybody a winner, our schools have dumbed down the standards so much that our curriculum is now 2 grade levels below 20 years ago. Students have always had varying abilities, you cannot change nature. As it is school is just a place for my kids to socialize, as they learn practically next to nothing during Reading, Math, Social Studies. I wish school hours could be shortened to include only Recess, Library, Music, PE and Art so that I could have more time to teach my kids the real important stuff at home.

The corruption is easy to see, and to say it's relatively rare is to be willfully blind. The methods of corruption that are perfectly legal and extremely common include but are not limited to: - Super PACs - The straight-up $5000 campaign donation - An offer of a cushy job at a private company when the politician or regulator leaves office - Donor ""bundling"" - Insider trading on congressional activity (i.e. a committee is secretly considering a bill that affects an industry, and the members of that committee make stock trades in that industry benefiting from that knowledge) There are lots of ways that those that can pay get what they want from public officials that don't involve saying ""Here's $500 if you give my company the contract."""
1063;19018;short work hours;1;1;to help the children learn be helpful;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for short work hours for parents to spend more time with their children and improve their development and education.;Shorten the working hours for parents -- especially where both parents have jobs -- and let the parents;Don't make the school day longer. Shorten the working hours for parents -- especially where both parents have jobs -- and let the parents spend more time with their children. The parental influence on children is the most important in their development and in their education. Besides, children need time to have fun -- just to be kids.
1064;9480;decriminalization;1;0;to be a good person get rid of criminals citizen better safe;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for decriminalization of drugs.;Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down;The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups.

When one is part of a society, one must participate and contribute for the whole and good of the society. We have long understood that when our children are well educated, the society will benefit. I agree with earlier comments that this is another ultra-conservative gesture to undermine public education and create a culture that rejects facts in favor of religious values, as though one cannot exist with the other.

European nations can use the same intelligence methods to identify European nationals who do likewise. Effective intelligence is more readily attained, than is the change of an entire culture such that we have fewer young males growing up bored and angry.

All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled;There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course). Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better.
1069;21043;kid home;1;2;to earn a living get raise promotion make money;the intention of the tweet towards 'kid home' is to challenge the assumption that waiters are lazy and only do their job for immediate gratification, and to advocate for better compensation and treatment of restaurant staff.;I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to go to the;"""Think about it. Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?"" The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses."

I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust.

1074;11900;rim;1;0;to be a better player the best good make game easier;the author of the tweet is expressing disagreement with the idea of raising the rim in basketball.;raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it;Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball).
1075;15686;capital gains;1;1;to be rich make money get wealthy;the intention of the tweet towards 'capital gains' is to criticize the claim that the wealthy will go galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised.;The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when;The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate.

An Atlantic spill would affect a heck off a lot more people than would a spill in the Arctic so how does this make sense politically? Last I checked wildlife doesn't vote. I have yet to see a good explanation for this decision, either from a political or an environmental position. If there is one I would like to hear it. Would a spill in the Atlantic 50 miles out disperse away from the coast more than would a spill in the Arctic or the Gulf? Because there surely will be one no matter how much the ""our drilling rigs, pipelines and trains are safe"" oil executives say."

It's all garbage;"It has nothing to do with nutrition education. Nowadays, we have this magical thing called the internet. There are no excuses for not knowing what's healthy and what isn't. You're either too lazy to figure it out for yourself (and so you let the food companies tell you what to eat -- nice conflict of interest right there), or you simply don't care. I also like how you mention ridiculous ""documented"" results yet fail to provide said documents. A ""50% reduction in the incidence of children becoming overweight."" You can deduce that just by changing drinks in a vending machine? Please tell what analysis was performed to come to that fitting conclusion -- as a statistician, I'd love to know.

1078;19887;technology;1;2;to be a good parent mother citizen person women educated;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of educating women and girls, and increasing access to birth control to reduce high birth rates and slow population growth.;Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth;Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off.
1079;11010;librarian;1;1;to be informed a leader helpful knowledgeable;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the importance of librarians in providing access to relevant and accurate information.;Easy access to relevant and accurate information is a cornerstone in our democracy. How can we;Easy access to relevant and accurate information is a cornerstone in our democracy. How can we not have specialists (aka librarians) who find, catalog, index, and protect the information used by all of us? We all frequently rely on specialists - medical, technical, financial, etc. - for the best information and advice. In this exploding universe of digital information, let's encourage our academic and governmental decision makers to fully realize the critical and specialized value that librarians provide to patrons of all ages.

Leading the way is the American Enterprise Institute.;The entire Republican agenda regarding healthcare is to siphon off tax dollars to give to insurance companies and not to provide any health care. Same with Social Security, privatize it giving billions to Wall Street to manage to garner fees and lose recipients hard earned money. What a bunch of crooks.

1081;8342;capital gains;1;0;get rid of taxes debt tax to be fair;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gains' is to propose a tax system that includes a 50% declining capital gains tax over 12 1/2 years.;capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years;We should have consumption (sales or VAT) taxes and capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years. The corporate tax rate should be zero, and C Corp. earnings should be taxed like S Corp. earnings. That would eliminate the cause of cash hoards in Corp. treasuries, and provide more liquidity. Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups). But look out for the European outcome with high VAT, income, dividend, and capital gain taxes like Germany where too large a share of GNP is run through government accounts. We should have very little reliance on income taxes as they discourage both work and business. Those mega yachts, and mega dwellings are a simptom of the foolish tax laws we have now.

I basically hated high school and loved college. The primary difference was not having to spend so many hours a day in class. I believe had my daily 7 hour high school imprisonment increased beyond its 8:30 to 3:30 schedule, I'd have gone from hating it to dropping out.
1083;6051;airline deregulation;1;1;to make sure no one gets hurt everyone is on time save money be safe fair;criticize airline deregulation.;miserable in-flight conditions should be regulated as matters of health and safety;Airline deregulation was driven by the theory of contestable markets. The theory doesn't work when there are no new or potential entrants, which seems to be the case today. Almost unnoticed, however, the Acela has reduced air travel between New York and Washington, DC by half. High-speed rail in other corridors will likely do the same. It is only a matter of time. Still, miserable in-flight conditions should be regulated as matters of health and safety. Minimum pitch (legroom), seat width, and luggage space, perhaps dependent on flight duration, should be considered. Passengers in seats without overhead luggage space (the last two rows in many 737s) should be permitted to check baggage without charge. And seats should be held for passengers who have unavoidably missed connections.
1084;10125;stopping terrorist acts;1;0;to be left alone not get hurt killed caught;the intention of the tweet is to justify the inaction against terrorists by comparing their actions to the 9/11 attacks and arguing that they are less deadly.;There is absolutely nothing we can do to stop the terrorists;There is absolutely nothing we can do to stop the terrorists. They are less deadly than the pilots of the 9/11 attack (some 3000 Americans vs. 200 French) and the smart ones of 9/11 killed themselves.

Our family recently built a large home in Austin. As we watched construction all craftsmen including those who constructed a large complicated swimming pool area where all Latino. Both the home in Austin and another in Palm beach Gardens Florida I note, all the garbage collection , yard maintainece, pool service, house cleaning, is all folks of Latino origin. I also understand while I haven't ever seen it, most of our frutis and vegtables are harvested by Lation's, as are our meat and poultry processing plants. What does this tell us? It tells me blacks and white people either wont work for these wages, or won't do that type work.

1089;18532;minority citizenship;1;0;PersonX is a slave racist thinks about slavery get job;the intention of the tweet towards target'minority citizenship' is to argue that the benefit derived from slavery was citizenship and cultural influence, but it does not excuse the action. the tweet also highlights the impact of illegal immigration and immigration reform on the economic well-being of minority precincts and the role of white-hispanics in demanding amnesty and work permits.;the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country;"As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation?"

Then, undergraduate school and white crosses changed that.;I was obese. Then, undergraduate school and white crosses changed that. I am aware that my opinion will be challenged, but we should not discriminate in any manner against obesity. Why? Because it's not the right way to treat people. All of the evidence presented in this debate is valid. Particularly that on the costs of our health and its burden on others. I do not believe that there is one obese person that would choose to remain obese if a miracle drug could return them to a normal weight. Obesity is a physical and an emotional nightmare. It eats at you (no pun intended) every hour of the day. We have irrefutable proof that it's thoroughly toxic, in every sense of the word. And yes, we should, as a people, be nutritionally sophisticated. Yet, we're not - we're nowhere near. But, by adopting many of these reforms and legislating stiff penalties, we are just going too far. Have we sunk so low that we are now to make laws and develop policies against the physique of our neighbor? The very thought is insane. There are better ways to solve this problem.
1091;4858;illegal immigrants;1;0;to get a job degree make money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the impact of affirmative action on the job market for college graduates, including those who are illegal immigrants.;They are in competition not just with illegal immigrants but the U.S.-born children of;Last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that 44% of recent college graduates were employed in jobs that don't require college degrees. And about 35% of older college graduates work in jobs that don't require college degrees. About 66 percent of two-year college graduates do the same sort of work as high school graduates or high school drop outs. They are in competition not just with illegal immigrants but the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, most of whom enjoy racial or ethnic affirmative action preference in college admissions and federal hiring.
1092;6850;assad;1;0;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet towards assad is that a true victory by his forces would lead to a wider and more destructive war, empowering hezbollah and projecting iranian power, and would present difficult choices for many powers in the region.;a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and;I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.
1093;21745;u.s. embassy;1;2;to have a family be in control save money children;the user is expressing their opinion on family dynamics, suggesting that older, financially stable individuals should raise children, while also questioning the impact of c-section deliveries on human evolution.;- is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund;"Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls ""two birds in a nest"" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund. The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be ""cut out?"
1094;14692;legalization;1;1;to be a scientist make point honest informed;the intention of the tweet is to argue against legalization by citing scientific evidence that addiction is caused by deprived environments rather than the substance itself.;Legalization is just too dangerous, says Ms. Evins. Has she studied the;Legalization is just too dangerous, says Ms. Evins. Has she studied the Rat Park experiments? Conducted over 20 years in a prestigious lab, then published as peer-reviewed journal studies, they establish that addiction is almost impossible to induce when the subjects are living in healthy environments. Oh, one detail: the subjects were rats...which correlate to humans 80% of the time in lab study results. So there's an 80% chance that human addiction results not from the substance but from deprived, abusive environments. There is a place she could put her efforts productively, instead of fighting a losing battle against a public jaded by decades of lies.

They have nothing to do with education nor with college. They are simply money-machines and training facilities for professional teams. Ms. Tatum from Spelman is right on the money: college sports have nothing to do with physical fitness, except for the few so-called students who participate in those sports. The TV and sports betting world benefit far more from college sports than do the athletes.
1096;7602;cherry-picking students;1;0;PersonX wants to help the poor is angry at teachers a teacher. teacher;the intention of the tweet towards target 'cherry-picking students' is to criticize the practice of relocating students from low-income neighborhoods to better neighborhoods for the purpose of improving their behavior.;Charter Schools were the solution;First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life. Everyone is afraid or too embarrassed to say the truth.
1097;2209;helping condo developers;1;1;to make more money avoid paying taxes money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'helping condo developers' is to expose the unfairness of the tax system and advocate for reform.;This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie;This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest!
1098;17400;privatize;1;0;to make money get rich;the intention of the tweet is to argue against privatizing infrastructure needed to supply public goods.;Keep the land fill, transfer stations, packer trucks etc in public hands. Bid out;It is important to recognize that if the infrastructure needed to supply that public good is privatized, then the that infrastructure owner has an effective barrier to entry and he can charge whatever he wants - well in excess of a publicly provided service. Keep the land fill, transfer stations, packer trucks etc in public hands. Bid out operations. Otherwise Tony Soprano takes over.
1099;5179;self-regulation by businesses;1;1;to be a good person get rid of something leader make point;the intention of the tweet is to argue that self-regulation by businesses is not effective and that a powerful and fair referee is needed.;self-regulation will not work and those firms should want a powerful and fair referee;If self-regulation by businesses is to work, VW must find that its cheating is unproductive. It must be the horrible example that will impel other firms to avoid doing what VW did. VW workers must lose their jobs and VW stockholders must suffer. To the extent that these things do not happen, self-regulation fails. Other firms will see that the consequences of dishonesty are manageable if sometimes severe. Since this is what firms have generally seen, self-regulation will not work and those firms should want a powerful and fair referee like the ones found in professional sports.

We do what we do because it's gratifying. We are compassionate because it feels good. We are nasty for the same reason. That includes the woman who thought it was a good idea to withhold pain meds because she wanted the dying to suffer. Mother Teresa was a sadist.
1101;16262;economic conditions of black populations;1;0;to have a better life be good person citizen;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the economic conditions of black populations in the united states are better than those in africa.;Africans Americans are by far the world's most affluent large black population;The chief argument against slave reparations in the United States is that the descendants of Africans transported as slave to the present-day United States are much better off than the descendants of Africans whose ancestors were not enslaved and transported to the United States. Today, the average per-capital income in Sub-Sahara Africa is about $750 a year and the average life expectancy is about 50 years. Africans Americans are by far the world's most affluent large black population.

For instance, soy does not contain estrogen;"This lady's ignorance is profound. For instance, soy does not contain estrogen. The molecular structure of soy appears similar to estrogen, but it is NOT estrogen and the body doesn't treat it as such. This is a myth, perpetrated by the dairy industry for obvious reasons. I am a vegan, and both my children are vegans from the day they were born. This is anecdotal evidence, but they are both usually tall, strong, healthy. One is getting a Ph.d and the other had a perfect score on the army intelligence test; both are irritating know it alls, definitely playing with full decks.. Because they were raised with compassionate hearts, they are both the kindest and most thoughtful people I know. Both of them have thanked me and their father repeatedly for raising them vegetarians."

European nations can use the same intelligence methods to identify European nationals who do likewise. Effective intelligence is more readily attained, than is the change of an entire culture such that we have fewer young males growing up bored and angry.

I think the answer would surprise you. Correlation is not causation - the sooner you learn that, the sooner you can get to the real root of our opiate addition problem.
1105;18081;conducting business;1;1;to learn new languages things communicate with others be understood;the intention of the tweet towards target 'conducting business' is to express frustration and resentment towards having to speak english in business meetings and lunch breaks, which can lead to expensive mistakes.;Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English;"My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because ""there's an American in the room"". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes."

More than any other president, Obama had the opportunity to advance peace by advancing justice when the Palestinians made their bid for statehood at the United Nations last September. If Obama had supported that effort, every nation in the world except Israel would have voted in favor of the motion, and Israel would have gotten the message that it is time to be as seriously forthcoming as J-Street advocates. Instead, he betrayed the Palestinians and isolated the United States more forcefully than has yet become apparent. If Romney is elected, that isolation will become fully manifest. If Obama is re-elected, there may be a second chance to earn that prematurely awarded Nobel Prize. Yes, support for Israel has hurt U.S. credibility. And the smidgen of credibility that is left may soon be obliterated.
1107;20878;home schoolers;1;2;to make the right decision choice best be a good person;the intention of the tweet towards home schoolers is to criticize the government's handling of the issue and suggest that the market will eventually adjust and consumers will make more informed decisions without politically motivated advice.;Parents are already making more informed decisions without politically motivated advice;This is a larger, more complex and more nuanced problem than administering the VA. How did the government do on that score? Here the market will adjust and the consumer will eventually win. Parents are already making more informed decisions without politically motivated advice.

Addiction disorder comes in many forms, but it is the mental disorder that requires our attention and not the vice. Haven't we wasted enough time, money and lives to learn this lesson???
1109;7345;computer;1;1;to gain knowledge be heard learn something;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the benefits of single-sex education, particularly for women, by sharing personal experiences of confidence-building and equal participation in such an environment.;Sweet Briar may not have a computer science major, but it is one of only two;Sweet Briar may not have a computer science major, but it is one of only two women's colleges that have an engineering degree. One of the things my sisters and I learned at Sweet Briar is how to use our voice. How to speak up and be confident. By knowing we could do that in a safe, nurturing environment, we knew we could do it in a hostile environment. I took 1 college course at a co-ed school. It was an education class that was about 2/3 women. Guess who did 75% of the talking? Guess whose opinion was validated by the professor and the TAs? Not the majority. Single-sex education (yes, I think men should have the single-sex opportunity too) may not be for everyone, but to argue that it is not a beneficial learning environment is uninformed and ignorant.
1110;7196;overcrowding;1;0;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet is to raise awareness about the negative impact of overcrowding on earth's habitat and resources, and to call for an end to the modern endless growth economy.;The modern endless growth economy--dedicated to making ever more people ever wealthier-;All six commentators make valid points. But I'm struck by the fact that none of them discuss the injustice of human beings monopolizing so large a percentage of Earth's habitat and resources, or the resulting ongoing mass extinction of Earth's species. If a particular nation or people were aggressively displacing other nations and peoples, overrunning their land and taking their resources, leaving these others displaced, diminished, even completely exterminated, the world would have no problem calling this behavior by its proper name: genocidal warfare. The modern endless growth economy--dedicated to making ever more people ever wealthier--is interspecies genocide. Its time we ended our war on nature and accepted limits to human numbers and human economic demands.

He just burned a book and expressed his frustration with a belief that he finds abhorrant. What is immoral about that? It is important that people have freedom to believe as they wish as long as they do not hurt others. But it is also our right be able to criticize and express frustation with a belief that we may feel is an anathema to our values.

Book simplified every topic discussed.;i just saw a book published by UC Press. Written by UC Prof. Rehash of five essays written over eleven year period. Book simplified every topic discussed. No deep engagement. Perhaps the students do in fact learn from their profs. when writing papers.
1113;12885;illegal labor;1;1;get a better job to make living money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the use of illegal labor in the american agricultural system.;The current American agricultural system vitally depends on having a supply of unskilled labour;When I read all the different opinions on this topic, I can boil it down to two statements. 1) The cost of farm labour is a small faction of the eventual cost of foods. 2) The current American agricultural system vitally depends on having a supply of unskilled labourers who are willing to work seasonal jobs with long, grueling hours, unsafe conditions, and little to no chance of advancement. A sufficient pool of people does not exist among legal American workers.
1114;9941;opioids;1;1;to be knowledgeable get better educated learn more;the intention of the tweet towards target 'opioids' is to criticize the lack of education and understanding among doctors regarding opioid use and its consequences.;I have used opioids for 12 years and I have not increased that amount in all that time;Patients should also have to undergo mandatory training. I have used opioids for 12 years and I have not increased that amount in all that time because I studied up on pain medication and addiction. Not one doctor over that time told me one thing that I learned in my own. I know more than most doctors. Doctors are passing out pills they don't understand and their patients have even a less understanding how to use them. No wonder why there is a big problem.

That proposition that has me paying 10x more taxes for my house than my neighbor in an identical house next door, and my neighbor across the street, in a mirror image house paying 4x more than me. It is an immoral law, that also buried California's once envious education system ... but that's what you get with republicans: Lack of willingness to fund infrastructure of the state or nation makes the nation grate not great.

1117;18154;islam;1;1;to have a better life be good person citizen leader free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'islam' is to criticize the mishandling and abuse of islam by militants and jihadists and call for a reformation within islam.;Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists;OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance!

Odds are that anyone who owns beach front property so alluring that total strangers would want to indulge in it is probably pretty well off, and in 21st century America nothing is more precious than safeguarding the rights and interests of those who are well off. The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens."
1119;21323;new employee;1;2;to learn something new get a job degree gain knowledge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'new employee' is to criticize the lack of rigor in the study of foreign languages in american colleges and universities, which may not prepare students for jobs abroad.;Higher ed in the US is costly beyond reason, and fundamentally dishonest;No Europeancountry I am aware of requires the study of a foreignlanguage at the undergraduate level. That is taken care of, usually very well, at the high school level. At most American colleges and universities, the study of foreign languages is a ditributioin requirement. Thios preserves jobs for faculty, but in most cases, after a year of study, the student may or may not be able to hire an amburga abroad. In short, like so much else in our colleges, the study of foreign languages is a fraud. I wish all the passionate hearts here had been fighting for rigor at our colleges. The whole shebang is tumbling down--and for good reason. Higher ed in the US is costly beyond reason, and fundamentally dishonest.
1120;2473;charging extra for different items at restaurants;1;1;to be treated fairly equally fair. fair;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the practice of charging extra for different items at restaurants.;Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive?;I don't comprehend the anger and vitriol. It comes across as a very conservative sense of entitlement. A restaurant is paying for food, drinks, service, ambience, seating, location, and a million other things. Some of these items are separately charged for, such as the food and drinks one orders, while others are recouped by unallocated charges on your bill. Part of that steak or wine you bought is actually going to dishwashing, real estate taxes, and new linens. Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive? It seems as silly to me as being angry that somebody who ordered lobster and whiskey pays more than somebody who got a sandwich and water. Should all diners be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their food consumption? If not, then I don't see why diners should be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their demand for prime reservations.

Such a sad but true statement about post-WW2 higher education. I came to this opinion prepared to stomp on it, but find that I agree. In theory. If high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone, everyone, an opportunity to experience learning for its own mind-expanding sake. Big if. Another big if: If French departments continue to exist. How do we assure this when we have no central, unifying vision for our education system? Without that, I'm afraid each institution will be making decisions individually based on the bottom line of immediate utility."
1122;8269;corporate taxes;1;0;to be a good citizen person make point money;the intention of the tweet is to argue against tax exemptions for corporations and in favor of a revenue-raising tax code.;If we are taxing corporations, none should be tax-exempt. Period!;Zimbalist tortuously describes distinctions without differences to arrive at his unwarranted conclusion. If we are taxing corporations, none should be tax-exempt. Period! The tax code is to raise revenue, not to institute social policies. Those, if deemed desirable, should be done through appropriations, where our representatives will have to justify their choices with each budget. Unfortunately, the tax code is much like military bases, pork spread so widely that no one wants to rock the boat, even if the totality is detrimental to the welfare of our country.

Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason.

To me policies are super important to both my own morale and my actual productivity. A lot of policies are counter-productive in stupid ways. That makes me miserable because I WANT to be productive and do a good job. Anything that prevents this, especially from my own team, is super frustrating. Such a waste.

Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more. What a ridiculous presumptuous argument.

With our efficiencies in production, and the limits to natural resources, this problem will get worse over time. We do have a population problem, a serious one, but it is more than just numbers and how to feed them. We can make it so large numbers of people do not die, but that doesn't mean this planet can be manipulated so that those same large number of people can truly live.

Civil workers are generally paid less but they get full benefits packages. Overall the cost is far less than subcontracting to a much higher paid layer of executives who take that money and then wine and dine the government hacks who make the decision on contract renewals. It's rife with corruption...

We are all not able to distinguish true medical research from personal stories, true, but if at the very least it starts a conversation between us and our medical provider that's a good thing. Any doctor not willing to discuss what I have read or learned, including the ability to admit not having too much knowledge about some particulars but willing to find out or point me in a good direction, are blessed with me finding one who will. It's my body, I am adamant about being involved in what happens to it.

The government may not interfere with freedom of expression. No need to talk about hate speech or other governments or cultures here - we have a culture that offends others because we do not allow any one group to be beyond criticism or protest. An ideal that we do not always live up to, but one which we never cease to strive towards. Free speech is either free or not.

Besides in an era when we routinely overspend a few Bill per day or hour, what is $18B for border security, and we are turning people away, i say more money for more turnaways. The fantasy that employer sanctions is real, is the fantasy that out underground economy does not exist. To use our favored dug deal motif, if our purchasers of contraband, illegal labor, are the criminals, then the sellers are the greater criminals, sp stop illegal sales, of labor or drugs, at the border first. This employer focus is burden shifting and exonerates the offerors of illegal supplies. as well as being fantasy and employer-bashing.

What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years.

Someone is talking about Iran in relations to its ally Syria. But the last thing we need is some armchair warmonger suggesting we exploit Syria to bring Iran to heel. This is exactly the wrong prescription. It will stir the pot in the region even more. The US has yet to respond (in public, at least) to the election of a relative moderate as Iran's president. Iran has shown some embarrassment at the use of chemical weapons in Syria. A bit of diplomacy would be in order. President Obama should pick up the phone and call his Iranian counterpart; it's entirely possible that Iran could be persuaded to help broker some kind of settlement in Syria. There's at least some chance it might work; the odds are much better than those of a missile attack calming things down. The chances of that are zero."

Namely, an addiction to chaos--and attention. Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out. And while Mr. Trump might call doing that being anti establishment. I would call it partly or wholly feeding an addiction.

However the poor old taxpayer is left to pay for the schools, the health care, food stamps etc, etc for these people and yes the baby delivery costs as they all try to have that anchor baby. Massive illegal immigration has become a disaster for the US that will permanently change it forever. Maybe the US should just give up and cede the Southern States of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to Mexico.

Why don't lets focus our attention on solving real problems. This country doesn't have a marijuana problem, and just because there's a correlation between people addicted to harder drugs like alcohol and painkillers who also smoke pot doesn't make it pot cause. If we have time and energy and resources, let's work on the drugs we know are dangerous and lets work on general education about addiction. Diverting our attention and energies from epidemic-level heroin use, for example, or from teaching about addiction generally to instead focus on marijuana specifically is worse than pointless, it will cost lives.

If high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone, everyone, an opportunity to experience learning for its own mind-expanding sake. Big if. Another big if: If French departments continue to exist. How do we assure this when we have no central, unifying vision for our education system? Without that, I'm afraid each institution will be making decisions individually based on the bottom line of immediate utility."

No - the 3 females were busy checking each other's photos and text messages on all 3 of their iPhones, giggling, sharing, not interacting with the guys at all.

1154;266;illegal immigration;1;1;to be a good citizen get better job worker person;the author's intention towards illegal immigration is to criticize it and advocate for stricter enforcement of laws against employers who support it, while also supporting legalization of the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country.;I'm not going to defend illegal immigration;I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc.

It takes a lot of determination and endurance to sit Junior down for two hours of lessons right after dinner. Further, as degrading as it may seem, schools provide an important function beyond education - as a day care service permitting both parents to be employed. As to the merits of giving tax breaks for home schooling, the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid. Home schooling certainly means higher taxes.

These days, to cover my second mortgage, I do anything ... including work for a catering service. I work hard and get tipped well. I've discovered that tipping is like manners, both are taught from an early age and area necessary measure in working relationships. I can always tell the difference between someone who doesn't have enough funds to tip and someone who is indifferent/ignorant/cheap. I always though everyone should have to work a job where they depend upon gratuities as part of their compensation. Nobody tips as well as others who work (or worked) in the service industry. Want the alternative? Go live in Europe... where the service is lazy, indifferent and hostile. I always thought the American system would put a jump in their step on the continent !!

I, for one, am not having it. If a business is a good investment, a reasonable tax rate is no barrier to investment for a smart investor.

Paying the rich to invest in their own country?"

At this moment the trend is opioid addiction particularly prescription drugs. The trend is moving a bit back to heroin (because it's cheaper!) but prescription drug addiction is still a huge public health problem. We (doctors) created the problem (inadvertently) and we should help solve it. A brief web-based training is not too much to ask; for many doctors it will be redundant as is much of the ongoing training we are required to participate in; but it is important to spread the word widely in the medical community."

I have come to realize the absence of women in leadership or in the ranks had the effect of a compassion vacuum because everybody was supposed to be male mentality tough.

Right now, tips put some of the power in the hands of the service person. Taking away tips would create yet another job where the restaurant would hire as cheaply as possible, and the people hired would be those the most desperate. Tips are the way in which a service job becomes more than that...and it needs to stay that way.

Some say the gain has already been taxed when the income ws earned to make the investment. By that standard, only ordinary w-2 income should be taxed at standard marginal rates. A person who purchases 100 shares of XYZ for $50.00 a share and sells it to another investor for $100.00 a share makes $50.00 a share. Not one penny goes to XYZ company to, say, purchase equipment or even better, hire another employee (unless of course it's an IPO). It seems to be just another tax advantage written into law by millionaires for the benefit of the wealthy investment class. Tell me that people would not invest in capital markets if there was no tax advantage and I would laugh. It would be like suggesting that people would not work as plumbers or accountants if they did not get a tax break of 50%

It is an act of imperial hubris for the United States to judge Cuba's human rights record, and in order for us to take such a judgment seriously we would have to ignore the dismal human rights record of the United States and the massive heap of corpses that US foreign policy is responsible for. The purpose of the embargo, of course, was to ""cause hunger, desperation and the overthrow of the Government,"" and as such is a far greater crime than any Cuba has committed under the despicable Castro regime."

There is so much cultural resistance to veganism - we are literally programmed to think we ""need"" to eat meat, put eggs in cakes, milk in our cereal, etc. But being vegan is ""mainstream"" now and increasingly popular. Not only is consuming animal products not necessary, but it has led to the untold suffering of trillions of animals. We all have the choice to not participate in that. I know and have met countless vegan individuals, from all walks of life, who are very, very healthy. There is no doubt in my mind that it's the healthiest way to live."

A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.

I've never tried pot brownies but perhaps I'd like them better than smoking which cannot be good for my lungs. My sense is people who use hard drugs are predisposed to their use and not pushed along by toking on a pipe of mary jane. I feel strongly that commentaries such as this written by people in positions affecting laws mislead and in turn do much more harm than good.

It certainly has precedents and does not seem prima facie unconstitutional. After all, would not a lot of Texans, Alaskans, and others enjoy giving total fealty to their state and avoiding any responsibility to a larger polity? No? When enough people realize that immigration is driven by forces much stronger and more pervasive than domestic policy, that it cannot be eliminated by laws, fences, patrols, or any other local action, and that it will continue to be the boon for us that it has always been, perhaps then a rational discussion will ensue.

Their rights should not even be suspended in my opinion, not for a day. Taking away the right to vote is the ultimate affront in a so-called democracy, and it helps create the downward spiral of criminals in our system. It is just another reason that once a person becomes a felon, they have very little chance of ever succeeded in this country. They'd be much better off leaving the country, however even that right is removed. Criminals are citizens too. This antiquated idea of removing voting rights is akin to the policies you see in North Korean.

And just to be clear, Mr. Rep., it is republicans who every time the oil price rises, fan the flames of armageddon, including national security (sic) and the trade deficit, to support more drilling, despite evidence each time from the studies republicans commission that drilling here can not affect any of these significantly. The low hanging fruit in lowering demand, however, can have a greater effect sooner and not hurt but rather help the economy, except for the oil industry and their lackeys, and benefit in many ways that republicans don't care about (health, environment, technological edge)."

Even Federal appointments are political footballs these days, note wellhow many of Obama's picks have been hung out to dry. The grilling that any SCOTUS nom gets is patently political, too - note well McConnell saying that any SCOTUS judge has to pass approval of the NRA. It is imaginary to think that politics are not involved with the judiciary.

It means people can reach beyond borders, live with others of a different culture in peace and increase the understanding between the world's cultures, religions etc. The notion that people should be beholden to a country is old-fashioned. A country in the end is just a piece of land between borders. What matters - and what keeps a country viable - are the values a country stands for. No piece of paper is going to change someone's allegiance in times of peace or war. Even Americans, when fighting in wars, always herald higher goals than mere defense of their country. It's about freedom, human rights and democracy. Those are values shares by the citizens of most countries in the world.
1178;15771;companies;1;0;to avoid being sued be in control charge power;the intention of the tweet towards target 'companies' is to criticize their actions and call for more regulation to protect the public from harm.;Greed is winning!;Less regulation might be feasible IF we had effective means for using civil law to receive just compensation for the harm that is caused by faulty products. Unfortunately, conservative judges and law makers dedicated to protecting their business patrons have succeeded in emasculating our ability to use civil law for relief. Recent NYT articles have revealed how business has been using arbitration to avoid be sued. Wise law makers and judges work to protect the public from harm, but it seems that wisdom is lacking in far too many current law makers and judges. Greed is winning!

If a particular nation or people were aggressively displacing other nations and peoples, overrunning their land and taking their resources, leaving these others displaced, diminished, even completely exterminated, the world would have no problem calling this behavior by its proper name: genocidal warfare. The modern endless growth economy--dedicated to making ever more people ever wealthier--is interspecies genocide. Its time we ended our war on nature and accepted limits to human numbers and human economic demands.

These days, to cover my;I waited tables and delivered pizza in high school and college. These days, to cover my second mortgage, I do anything ... including work for a catering service. I work hard and get tipped well. I've discovered that tipping is like manners, both are taught from an early age and area necessary measure in working relationships. I can always tell the difference between someone who doesn't have enough funds to tip and someone who is indifferent/ignorant/cheap. I always though everyone should have to work a job where they depend upon gratuities as part of their compensation. Nobody tips as well as others who work (or worked) in the service industry. Want the alternative? Go live in Europe... where the service is lazy, indifferent and hostile. I always thought the American system would put a jump in their step on the continent !!

1182;9118;muslim;1;1;they don't like it want to be free left alone;criticize;Muslims need to learn that Islam is just another religion with no greater status or legal protection than any;Freedom of speech apparently doesn't protect those who criticize Islam, Islamofascism and Sharia law. It's a sad day when it's perfectly legal to burn the US flag, the Bible, effigies of unpopular political characters, but not the Koran. Muslims need to learn that Islam is just another religion with no greater status or legal protection than any other religion. If they don't like it they should move to repressive countries in the Middle East that live, work and think about 1000 years behind the West. They're free to leave. They are not free to impinge on Americans' right and liberties. Unlike other countries, the US must never consider freedom of speech a negotiable right, protected for some and not others.
1183;139;restaurant;1;0;to make money. get a raise be generous. generous money;criticize the practice of tipping in restaurants.;It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping;It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.

Hasn't the west already learnt from the removal of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi from Iraq and Libya respectively and what it has done to those countries? The USA is responsible for the creation of ISIS in a passive way as it is also friends with Saudi Arabia. The removal of Assad govt will lead to a stronger ISIS and a bigger problem in middle east. The removal of the Assad govt is being sought mainly because of Israel while it bombs the hell out of Gaza killing thousands of people. Working with the Assad govt is a smart thing to do. Don't fix it if it ain't broke.

My brother, sister, and I still talk about that trip - good memories. My wife and I always took our kids on vacations. We all had a great time and I hope that their memories of these trips is as fond as ours are. Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. ""In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!"""
1186;14132;aba testing being open to all;1;1;to be a lawyer get job degree independent;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for open access to aba testing for all.;I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it;If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.

They have an employer. I'm not their employer. I'm the customer. Where else but in a restaurant does the customer directly pay the salary of the worker? It's bizarre. In fact, some restaurant employees are the employees of very wealthy employers, who can well afford to pay them, but sit instead somewhere and chuckle at the good fortune of not having to pay their employees but a pittance because the customers, those suckers, are picking up the tab.

If one looks objectively, disregarding personal taste, whether it is a Gehry, a Nouvel or Isozaki building here in New York - they all stand out as impeccably executed architecture. Most of them relate to their context (see the formal empathy between the Beekman Tower and Woolworth Building, for instance), or creating a new one where such context is either weak or lacks character. It is a welcomed fad that reinstates the lost 'edge' New York once had, and subliminally educates both the developers' taste and the local crop of professional talents. Why should we be afraid of that?...

1191;7701;visa;1;0;to have a better life get job;the intention of the tweet towards target 'visa' is to criticize the process of obtaining a visa and the perceived unfairness towards legal immigrants who have to wait years for it while illegal immigrants can easily enter the country without one.;waited years for visa to be available;This article is misleading readers into thinking all the immigrants are the problem. In fact, only illegal immigrants are , not legal. We filed the paperwork, paid for the fees , waited years for visa to be available, countless of trips to UCSIS , and U.S Consular. Years after years of waiting, we can now set foot on U.S head held high as legal immigrants. Meanwhile, illegal immigrants sneak into the U.S , anchor babies, expect to have benefits and free education without paying a penny. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Is is fair of legal immigrants like us ? Dear Mr Saavedra, have you ever been cut in line while you are lining up in a busy restaurant or theme park? That's the same feeling of legal immigrants toward illegal immigrants and freeloaders like you.

Everyone is being spoon fed information and they blame Facebook for not getting the balance right? Thank you, Mrs. Squires for making the most salient point. What would Emerson and Thoreau and Whitman, all champions of individualism, say about the TV/internet age?

University should be about education. The European model where sports clubs are sponsored by cities or municipalities allows people who want the chance to participate in competitive athletics, at zero cost in distraction to the mission of their universities. That's even better than Division III.

Migrants coming from the safety of Turkey are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who refuse to come to France because they want to go to Germany are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who bully their way to their desired destination are not in search of safer zones. Please stop trying to shove this argument on readers. Just because you repeat it does not mean it becomes any more believable.
1196;7276;affirmative action;1;1;to be a racist leader they want help;the intention of the tweet is to argue in favor of affirmative action.;This shouldn't cancel race affirmative action, since that is an extra layer of roadblock;If the income based achievement gap is now 2x the size of the race gap, that attests to our under-funding of education, and to our economic policies that create new lower classes for all races for decades. The living standards and security of all have been on a downward path. This shouldn't cancel race affirmative action, since that is an extra layer of roadblocks in the upward path for minorities. Economic policies of the conservatives have for years been working against the gains blacks made in past decades. So even if more whites are poor or near poor than before, still race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need. Our legal racial apartheid is all too recent-in my lifetime. And the policies and political messages of our dominant conservative party have still been amplifying negative race messages, using them to win elections.
1197;17660;a threat;1;0;to be in control power a leader charge;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the perception of iran as a threat and to shift the focus to saudi arabia as a greater threat.;Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around;In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran.
1198;12019;sports are not academics;1;1;to have fun be competitive successful learn;the intention of the tweet is to argue that sports are not academics and that interscholastic speech competition and chess are better alternatives for social development and competition.;Sports is not academics;Home school is good thing. I've had great success in the classroom at the college level with home school students. Sports is not academics. There seems to be some value in permitting home school students to play sports from the social development perspective. As far as competition is concerned. A more appropriate mix of academics and competition is interscholastic speech competition (forensics and debate) and chess. These activities mix competition and academics much better. In fact, I believe funding for the above activities should be equal to sports. They also serve title nine objectives and should be counted as interscholastic competition activity, just like sports in competitive activity with some thinking taking place.

I work for an insurance company, and I am constantly taking continuing education courses. I often hear my peers make comments such as, ""I don't care what kind of score I get as long as I pass."" When I hear comments like that, I often think to myself, why would someone want to settle for ""passing""? Why not aim higher? Unfortunately, for many people, ""good"" is good enough for them."

It is the height of hypocrisy for the US to relentlessly bomb Syria and then slam the door in the face of war-weary Syrian refugees, all while boasting about being an opportunistic, strong and exceptional nation. Americans are yet again showing the world that they are hypocritical, selfish and merciless cowards. I'm surprised our allies haven't slammed the door in our faces yet. I sure would.

Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago.

When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too."

It comes across as a very;I don't comprehend the anger and vitriol. It comes across as a very conservative sense of entitlement. A restaurant is paying for food, drinks, service, ambience, seating, location, and a million other things. Some of these items are separately charged for, such as the food and drinks one orders, while others are recouped by unallocated charges on your bill. Part of that steak or wine you bought is actually going to dishwashing, real estate taxes, and new linens. Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive? It seems as silly to me as being angry that somebody who ordered lobster and whiskey pays more than somebody who got a sandwich and water. Should all diners be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their food consumption? If not, then I don't see why diners should be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their demand for prime reservations.

Corporate law breakers may be subject to fines but rarely prison terms. The Board of directors is a good place to start handing out personal responsibility.

The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.

Brain washed from birth they will be ideal candidates for the mindless voters he specializes in recruiting.

The business of NY is real estate and the banks that finance it. Much like the business of Washington is government and the business of Las Vegas is gambling. Real Estate taxes and the revenues that come from the construction of new buildings is the lifeblood of the city. It has been that way for at least two hundred years. Ours is not a national capital like London, Paris, or Berlin. We are a business city and have to generate as well as spend money. NY has been very good at both things for many decades. The idea that somehow real estate interests are out of control or taking over how the city is run is perhaps news for 1815, not 2015. Without the millionaires and billionaires building and buying these fancy new places, New York would be Philadelphia. Philadelphia is a lovely place and if you prefer it, you should seriously consider moving there because NY is never going to be Philadelphia.

I see no difference in the quality of the service, and the cost of the meals is not much greater. Often people round up the cost of the check to include an additional small tip for the server, but it's not required and seems not to be expected. Of course, it may be that these folks are being paid a living wage to start with!

This is just one huge ethnocentric stereotype we are producing to counter the Chinese lady's ethnocentrism. In reality, the competence that Asians drill into their children has translated into remarkable commercial and technical success, and they have longstanding traditions in the arts that are also not much less creative than the stuff coming out of the US. So let's drone on about our great creativity while the Asians run circles around us.

My experience has been that it's hard to know what a difference being in a same-sex classroom can make unless you've been there. I also know from my teaching experience that the males in a classroom need a different kind of learning space and shape than females often do, especially in the middle and high school years. They each get to the same place but often by different routes, and that's ok. It's not for everyone, but that's no reason to allow single-sex education to wither on the vine. It's relevant now, and will be in the future.

Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here. By the way, in case you were wondering, I'm a first generation Dominican-American whose naturalized parents emigrated to New York legally in the 60s.

Oh wait, that is our current law. Silly me.

Oh wait, we do that too. I guess you've already won, dude.

Reagan fired strikers, yet this time we're expected to reward them even more? Tax cuts and deals for those who can afford to get most of their income from investing seems to prove one thing - they don't circulate as much of their income as the rest of us do. From the way things are running this far in to Bush's ""temporary"" tax cuts all I can picture is a series of mansions with mattresses high in the air over all that frozen cash. Face it, Mr. Miron. There's no tax bar so low that some of the wealthy wouldn't pay bright people to find somewhere else with a lower rate. I'm picturing a land of negative taxation, and there they'd probably say they needed to be paid more by the populace."

Al-Qa'eda again, would be my guess;Not our fight. What is the objective? How would we know when we have achieved that objective? Who really wins? Al-Qa'eda again, would be my guess. The British, the French, and Turkey all have the ability to project military power in the Eastern Mediterranean. Let them go after Syria, and let them bear the consequences. To be fair, I only worked in U.S. embassies in the Middle East for 10 years, and have only studied the Arabic language, culture, and politics for 27 years, so I might not know what I'm talking about.

It is hard to see any benefit;No intelligent person thinks that all Muslims are terrorists or terrorist sympathizers, but no intelligent person believes that there will be no Muslim terrorist amongst 10,000 Syrian refugees. That most of the Muslim terrorists in the US were children of immigrants is hardly reassuring. We have more than enough homegrown religious fundamentalists. It is hard to see any benefit to the American people of importing even more.

Here's the key. The company left the door open and the cow left.

My resentment is with the hording of resources by a small number of Americans for their own benefit.

As more and more people try to change their eating habits it is critical that labels are clear, easily understood and enforceable. Proper labeling is one of the ways to ensure that consumers have the information needed to make informed and accurate decisions.

There isn't a day without smog hovering over the area. The neighborhood does not suffer density issues and there are no manufacturing facilities anywhere near the whole region. Yet, the smog in all its reddish-purple-haziness never flags. It comes out of the west from China. Over one billion people manufacture the good that seven billion of us need and it is killing us with polluted air, water and as an unsafe food source. All of this damage is done in the name of a single word: profit. It's time that we redefine that word or we will certainly die out as a specie.

I do not believe, it even trusts itself. Why take so many years before doing what was asked of them? The nuclear question took too long to be answered. Why would Iran want nuclear weapons ? For whom? Defensive, offensive, that was the reason. It's a country with a religious dictatorship. Trouble for the region, and still, trouble for itself......
1230;17907;population control;1;0;to get a better job be good teacher make point. citizen learn about the world;the intention of the tweet is to express concern about the unsustainability of high birth rates in small countries without similar economic growth rates, and to suggest migration as a potential solution.;high birth rates would become unsustainable in small countries without similar economic growth rates;I used to teach Quantitative Reasoning. One of the databases we used to analyze was birth rate by country. That was over ten years ago, but it showed my students how high birth rates would become unsustainable in small countries without similar economic growth rates. The same countries we identified as problems back in that course are in the center of the refugee and problematic youth crises now. Just divide the birth rate (in percentage) into 70 and you get the population doubling time. How can an economically stressed country every imagine handling the doubling of its population in less than a generation? It doesn't make any sense to talk about overall wealth in the world, either, when people have no realistic prospect of any future access to it without migrating. I would try migrating too if I were in such a country.

Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: ""please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone."""

It certainly has precedents and does not seem prima facie unconstitutional. After all, would not a lot of Texans, Alaskans, and others enjoy giving total fealty to their state and avoiding any responsibility to a larger polity? No? When enough people realize that immigration is driven by forces much stronger and more pervasive than domestic policy, that it cannot be eliminated by laws, fences, patrols, or any other local action, and that it will continue to be the boon for us that it has always been, perhaps then a rational discussion will ensue.

I'm a little stunned that Princeton would consider scrapping it. Estimates vary on what percentage of the world speaks or understands English - I've read between 12 and 25 percent - but even if you accept the higher of those numbers, that leaves three quarters of the world's population that does not. Jobs that require college degrees very often also require contact with people from other countries. To me it's clear that advanced education isn't complete without studying another language. Fluent in a second language? Take a third.

If the industry is subsidized, the government has every right to step in and regulate.

Weakening one (under the unrealistic assumption that the monies fried up will be given to state institutions, and not the state Medicaid or roads program) is not a solution. The solution is what it has always been: wise and forward-thinking state legislators have generously funded public colleges.

If parents want them to learn a;If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir.
1240;20857;city;1;2;to get a job be smart productive learn;the intention of this tweet is to promote the effective use of online tools, like google and wikipedia, for research while discouraging the notion that these tools are the cause of poor research or lack of research skills.;Google and Wikipedia may allow incompetent researchers to produce a flurry of activity;Google and Wikipedia may allow incompetent researchers to produce a flurry of activity and a work product that looks like a substitute for research. However, Google and Wikipedia are not the root cause of bad research or students who don't know how to research. A student who understands the fundamental principles of research will use various tools appropriately to reach project goals. One thing that strikes me: some people who object to the use of online tools seem to have a hazing agenda. In my opinion, if a student researches well without the long nights in the stacks, or uses intelligent online tools and techniques to narrow down the reading list, that is a good thing.

Both Mr. Fratto and Ms. Rugy give us numbers that aren't in conflict. It appears that if the administration of the bank could be focused, regulations clearly presented to try and concentrate the activities of the bank into growing industries and promoting jobs here through lending into specific international markets that produce clear benefits on both sides of the deal, and not lending money to Corporations like Pemex, and piling Federal money onto Major Oil. They already get too many breaks.

Part of what made it wonderful was not that I didn't have to tip (I was told it would have insulted service personnel), but that the service was uniformly, 100% outstanding no matter what city or village I was in, no matter the type of service establishment. The whole experience was a delight.

It is the height of hypocrisy for the US to relentlessly bomb Syria and then slam the door in the face of war-weary Syrian refugees, all while boasting about being an opportunistic, strong and exceptional nation. Americans are yet again showing the world that they are hypocritical, selfish and merciless cowards. I'm surprised our allies haven't slammed the door in our faces yet. I sure would.

Which evolved ape is worthy of veneration;The whole idea of sainthood is absurd. Which evolved ape is worthy of veneration? Maybe Dorothy Day. Certainly not Mother Theresa nor John Paul II. On top of that, the Catholic Church has provided a bureaucratic process to vet the applicants including proof of two miracles, which are usually a sham to push through the desired prospect. Who on earth would venerate dictators, corrupt financiers and evil bishops? Only the Catholic Church! Next they will be canonizing Scalia. Instead of picking the Catholic All-Star team, when will the Catholic Church celebrate the beauty and weaknesses of ordinary human beings?
1246;6813;university standards;1;0;to get a good job be worker better person education;criticize university standards.;Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more;"When I observe that admission standards and courses in ""college"" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and ""college"" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more ""remedial cases"" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just ""we want workers ready to start tomorrow"" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces."

1248;1278;tip;1;0;to make money. get a raise be generous. generous money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tip' is to criticize and argue against it.;Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching;It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.

Both are going to happen no matter what the law.;How is prostitution different from gambling? Both are going to happen no matter what the law. Both are called vices. People moralize about both. Both can be risky and addictive. Both can ruin lives. Most people, however, are fine with these activities, when used in moderation, or not at all. The difference is obvious. Gambling enjoys the benefits of giving money to politicians. Also gambling is taxed (a tiny bit), offering the perfect rationalization back to those politicians. Why not do the same thing for prostitution? Want to discourage too much of it? Tax it more.

That said, what is old is new. Ask any long time New Yorker, and they will tell you about the beat cop, who knew what was going on, and knew who were the troublemakers, and knew how to deal with them appropriately. While it is a different era now, someone with a quality of life crime (like selling illegal cigarettes) can be dealt with by basically telling them to get lost and not show his face on 'his' street again. There are ways of using the force and power of the law without arresting people. If the person doesn't get the hint, or otherwise acts out, you always have the arrest as a backup, but most low level people will avoid the confrontation.

It could be worse, they may want to do something really dumb like cut taxes even more or try to start another war. First of all they don't have the votes and under 8 years of Bush the problems just got worse.

That, of course, assumes a former employee can afford the cost and hit to his reputation for bringing lawsuit against a former employer for an onerous non-compete. You mention these agreements protect the business owner, but I fail to see how they benefit the other party in the agreement, the employee, one iota. A more equitable arrangement would be to require the business owner to pay a premium for preventing his employees from selling their services in a free marketplace."

I would love to find a college beyond Wabash that's all male. Because: on average boys are doing poorly in school compared with girls. It would be even better if that all-male school encouraged the arts--everything from fine arts to domestic arts, animal husbandry, and gardening, in addition to a rigorous curriculum of reading, writing, arithmetic, and science.

This means I can only exempt my children from vaccination requirements if I do NOT have an objection based on reason - it can only be a faith-based objection. I find it very condescending to be told that the thinking has already been done for me and I cannot think for myself but only follow the tenets of a religion. Why do we privilege religion as beyond questioning and reproach but have no respect for freedom of thought?
1255;14130;california southern school of law;1;1;to be a lawyer get job degree independent;the intention of the tweet towards california southern school of law is to criticize the aba for limiting the number of licensed lawyers and for requiring a declaration under penalty of perjury that the author would not work while in law school.;My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself;If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.

One of the important lessons learned in schools is that we are different, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. We are setting our children up to be unable to adapt to change. Speaking as a teacher, we are also making teaching an even less appealing profession. We already have to accodomate and modify based on IEPs and languages, and mandated testing. What other profession gets so much input from those outside the profession? Do people go to their doctors and tell them how to treat their problems? Give advice to their lawyers or accountants? Teachers are professionals and should be treated as such. Many of us have masters degrees and just want to work with kids, to help them learn and grow. We are impeded in that by so many factors, and this law is another one.
1257;1081;sport;1;0;to win the game be best play a;the intention of the tweet is to compare and contrast the differences between basketball in the past and present, highlighting the evolution of the game and its impact on players' abilities.;The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there;"The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3"" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk."

Myriad can have a patent on the techniques used to sequence;Ridiculous. Myriad can have a patent on the techniques used to sequence a gene, a patent on the test used to detect the gene, but they cannot patent the gene itself. It's the equivalent of Newton patenting F=MA - it's a fact of the natural world that mankind has discovered, not something new mankind has created.
1259;15354;capital gains;1;0;to save money make be fair get rich;the intention of the tweet towards 'capital gains' is to argue that capital gains taxes do not have a significant impact on development and job market.;Slashing capital gains taxes just doesn't magically create jobs;Almost every other large nation that I looked up has a capital gains tax of 20% or more, and many other countries levy additional taxes for their social safety nets. The IRS still taxes US taxpayers on foreign investments, but allows credit for any taxes paid to a foreign government. In other words, unless they imitated the Facebook guy who renounced his US Citizenship, investors have been paying taxes on foreign investments all along. Given that most corporations are multi-national businesses, very few investors are putting money into purely foreign companies. As far as the impact on development and the job market, demand and growth opportunities have much more to do with where investment money goes than nominal differences in capital gains taxes. Slashing capital gains taxes just doesn't magically create jobs. We've had 30 years to figure this one out.
1260;2541;a gamble;1;0;to help the poor get rich. be fair rich make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'a gamble' is to criticize and condemn the gambling industry as a regressive enterprise that exploits human weakness and greed.;The gambling industry is an entirely predatory exploitation of human weakness and greed;The gambling industry is an entirely predatory exploitation of human weakness and greed. The mathematically challenged are exploited with the false hope of riches while our communities are stripped of vital economic resources.

Exxon, Chevron, Shell are all playing golf right now figuring out how to stop this. We've had the possible technology since the seventies and then no one wanted to listen to poor Jimmy Carter...so we elected Ronnie Raygun and all was well.

I will say I spoil my cats, not horribly, but they have toys, scratch post, etc. No pet (fur baby) is perfect. So because they claw your couch you rip their fingers out? Sooooo, please don't procreate I don't want to know what you would do to a human child for say wetting the bed, or throwing a temper.....pets have feelings, brains, hearts, etc. Treat them with some respect and understanding. Ask yourself ""what can I do differently to help my cats bad behavior."" I'll also add my cats are loving and have NEVER bitten anyone! They also don't scratch or claw me, in fact 2 out of 3 are especially aware of people are are careful to retract claws when playing/running/jumping near humans. Time and patience.

It is important that people have freedom to believe as they wish as long as they do not hurt others. But it is also our right be able to criticize and express frustation with a belief that we may feel is an anathema to our values.

Let the Sunnis have;The old Cold War methods of containment and deterrence will work with ISIS, as they did with the former Soviet Union. There is no need to pour more American money into this, other than, perhaps, to defend an independent Kurdistan. If ISIS reaches the Saudi borders, it can stop there. Let the Sunnis have their state.

Exactly how many should be allowed to come to Europe and the US? And why is it the responsibility of such places to provide help from Muslims when they won't fight for their own homelands?

Jews have been living in the Land of Israel for thousands of years; even during of times that most of the Jewish people was at exile, and before the Arab occupation and colonialization of the land. It is mind bugling how people are willing to accept this ongoing occupation, just because they think Arabs lived there sine dinosaurs time. Most of the Arab immigrated there parallel to the Zionist immigration in the new era. Read the Ottoman census, the British census and understand the Arab names and origins. Take a look at the big picture; a huge part of the globe is Christian, another huge part of the globe is Muslim. There is a little tiny piece of land for the Jews, and the Liberal of the free world want to take it away."

Tell that to the U.S sailers who were seized and humiliated in violation of international law. Tell that to the hostages just released from Iranian dungeons. Tell that to the Saudi Ambassador who was targeted for assassination in Washington D.C. in December of 2012. Tell that to the Israelis who face endless missiles Iran supplies to terrorists. There is no country in the world working as hard to sow violence, terror and hatred as is Iran. Intellectuals safe in their ivory towers may not understand this, but normal people do.
1268;21452;tip;1;2;to learn about another culture have a good time country see the world.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tip' is to express nostalgia for a time when traveling and cultural exchange were more personal and local.;Real glad I experienced life (and the street) before globalization!;In the early 80's and well into the 1990's, I frequently traveled from Paris to New York and back. French friends often supplied me with a list of specific American items 'they absolutely needed' and friends in the U.S. would do the same - asking for their favorite French things...Now, with the internet and globalization in full swing, this practice has completely stopped. Today, most of us *living almost anywhere* can simply order most anything 'foreign' on the web...and, more than likely, can actually find that very same item in a store close to where we live... The streets of Paris and New York are looking very much the same today (very boring)...and we're definitely inching closer to the dreaded one world concept. Real glad I experienced life (and the street) before globalization!
1269;2708;modern views of race;1;0;to be inclusive inclusive. make a difference racist;the intention of the tweet towards target'modern views of race' is to argue against reparations for racial mixing, as it would open a socially-divisive new polemic on determining who is white and who is black, based on genetics.;reparations would be a terrible step backwards into social identifications based on race;Determining entitlement to reparations would open major wounds in US society. The issue of the extent of racial mixing would have to be addressed -- a topic that the US (particularly the South, where it was rampant) finds extremely painful. Aside from permitting reparations for people who are obviously white, it would open a socially-divisive new polemic on determining who is white and who is black, based on genetics. As a society that is pretty much committed to allowing natural processes to make us, as individuals, as rainbow as we wish to be, reparations would be a terrible step backwards into social identifications based on race.
1270;1465;judiciary;1;0;to be in charge power a judge control;the intention of the tweet is to argue that politics is involved in the judiciary.;It is imaginary to think that politics are not involved with the judiciary.;Why would anyone think that judges are kept out of politics? On many state or country levels they are flat-out elected. The ones who are appointed are often on the receiving end of political reward. Even Federal appointments are political footballs these days, note wellhow many of Obama's picks have been hung out to dry. The grilling that any SCOTUS nom gets is patently political, too - note well McConnell saying that any SCOTUS judge has to pass approval of the NRA. It is imaginary to think that politics are not involved with the judiciary.

Many advances in automation eliminate jobs. So I am very cautious. It may be that lowering/eliminating capital gains taxes lead to more jobs for accountants and tax consultants, but we have far too many of these anyway.

Ignoring atrocities committed by allies is an established and accepted foreign policy practice so perhaps we just declare Assad an ally and call it a day.
1273;10141;work;1;1;to have a private office space be left alone privacy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'work' is to criticize the traditional cubicle office design and advocate for a more private and comfortable workspace.;There is no reason why workers have to be stuffed in sardine cans divided;In my first cubicle job, 2 people each shared a telephone that was in a hole between cubicles. A large room constructed of cinder blocks with linoleum square tiles on the floor was a zoo of ringing telephones, loud conversations and a constant stream of people walking to and fro. In my next job, I had my own private office. Hallelujah! There is no reason why workers have to be stuffed in sardine cans divided by partitions that block nothing. A windowless square is far superior to an open floor design.
1274;10058;ensuring better lawyers;1;1;to help the poor be a lawyer make money teach;the intention of the tweet is to propose a solution to ensure better lawyers by making law schools refund all tuition if the graduate doesn't pass the bar exam.;Make the schools refund all tuition if the graduate doesn't pass the bar exam. They;The basis for this problem is that law school is a big money maker for the universities. Unlike medical school or grad school in the sciences and engineering, there are no expensive labs to maintain. Just a big lecture hall and an instructor. That has led to a proliferation of law schools and a decline in the average ability of those accepted to law school. My solution: Make the schools refund all tuition if the graduate doesn't pass the bar exam. They will then be more selective and do a better job of teaching.
1275;17470;asian;1;0;to make fun of others a point. them point;the intention of the tweet towards 'asian' is to challenge the stereotype that asians are less creative than people from other cultures.;the competence that Asians drill into their children has translated into remarkable commercial and technical success;I find the belief that children raised the Asian way will turn out to be dull and uncreative a little hard to believe. This is just one huge ethnocentric stereotype we are producing to counter the Chinese lady's ethnocentrism. In reality, the competence that Asians drill into their children has translated into remarkable commercial and technical success, and they have longstanding traditions in the arts that are also not much less creative than the stuff coming out of the US. So let's drone on about our great creativity while the Asians run circles around us.
1276;2530;negative impact of gambling;1;0;to help the poor get rich. be fair rich make money;the tweet expresses a strong negative view of the gambling industry and its impact on individuals and communities.;The mathematically challenged are exploited with the false hope of riches while our communities are stripped;The gambling industry is an entirely predatory exploitation of human weakness and greed. The mathematically challenged are exploited with the false hope of riches while our communities are stripped of vital economic resources. Far better we tax ourselves fairly to promote industry, rebuild our infrastructure and educate our population and provide universal healthcare than to support these entirely regressive enterprises.
1277;2797;food;1;1;to lose weight be healthy healthier eat;the intention of the tweet is to express that being a vegan and consuming all carbs, including good ones, is not suitable for the author due to their hypoglycemia, resulting in constant hunger and overeating, leading to weight gain.;Lots of people are sensitive to carbs in varying degrees, and they are just going to;As a hypogycemic, eating all carbs, all the time (even the good kinds) is just not going to work for me -- I'd be hungry all the time an inevitiably overeat and gain weight. Lots of people are sensitive to carbs in varying degrees, and they are just going to get fat being a vegan. I've seen it happen to several friends. This does not mean it is OK to eat bacon and msdonalds, though, people. Try wild salmon and salad.
1278;12901;their children;1;1;to be helpful teach them help;the intention of the tweet towards 'their children' is to encourage them to learn independently while also providing support and guidance through reviewing assignments.;reviewing assignments with them can often help them to see where they made mistakes or help them to clarify;Yes, it is important for children to learn how to do their homework by themselves. However, reviewing assignments with them can often help them to see where they made mistakes or help them to clarify matters that they may not fully understand. If a child is able to feel comfortable discussing material with his or her parent, there is an opportunity to reinforce what the child is learning. These interactions can build self-confidence and help to develop critical thinking. Students who are in large classes rarely get the type of individual attention in a class that they may receive from an involved parent at home. Sometimes revisiting the material at home can present a child with the opportunity to understand more about it.
1279;20098;human devolving;1;2;to win the war be a leader make deal understood;the user expresses concern about potential consequences of large-scale weapon sales, urging caution and consideration of china's response, while acknowledging us commitments to both taiwan and china.;The danger is that weapon sales at that scale will change the calculations on each side and may trigger;I am sure Mr. Murray knows what he talks about regarding the capabilities of various weapon systems. The danger is that weapon sales at that scale will change the calculations on each side and may trigger an immediate response from China that the US does not want to face. Also, not only did the US make promise to Taiwan, but also made promise to China.
1280;7233;research papers;1;1;to gain knowledge be knowledgeable educated informed learn;the intention of the tweet towards target'research papers' is to highlight the availability of international data in academic study and research papers, and the potential for learning and self-education through the internet.;Academic study, any research paper done today has international data avilable like never before;Actually the internest stands to make research even greater in depth more available to all on any given subject. Academic study, any research paper done today has international data avilable like never before. The internet is full of terrible information as well, undocumented, unproven and unreliable. However if used right one can learn as much with a computer and the internet as any university can teach. I have educated myself with the internet on a number of subjects I am interested in and can answer off the cuff questions regarding any of those given subjects with direct factual answers without rhetoric.

1281;10022;job;1;0;to make more money money. a living profit;the intention of the tweet towards target 'job' is to express frustration and discouragement towards the taxation system that hinders job creation and economic growth among small entrepreneurs.;a lot of jobs, capital and opportunity is not being created;This article touches a nerve. For 40 years I've operated a tour company in Canada and ,on account of taxation, was in no hurray to grow the company.One accepts tax on income but when taxed 40% on the additional income that the original income may make, the incentive to expand dissipates.So if this represents the mind frame of a small number entrepreneurs, a lot of jobs, capital and opportunity is not being created.
1282;19181;oil;1;0;to make money. help the poor save money;the intention of the tweet towards 'oil' is to suggest that a more balanced foreign policy in the middle east is required to ease oil prices and prevent high oil prices from negatively impacting the economy.;High oil prices do not help the economy;Does Israel have any oil to sell to the US. If not, a more balenced foreign policy in the Middle East is required. The world' oil supply, the is conventional oil is on a slippery plateau. High oil prices do not help the economy. Lowering Middle East tensions would ease oil prices. Sorry to be so Machiavellian, but that is the reality today.
1283;8674;immigration;1;1;to be a good citizen person better have life get job;the intention of the tweet is to argue against excluding immigrants from america, emphasizing their positive contributions to the country's economy and culture.;Immigrants are people and people are assets they bring their creativity, energy, and;"What a silly line of reasoning. We have to stop thinking about immigrants as people who simply take our stuff, as if there were a finite supply of ""jobs"" piled up in a warehouse somewhere, the distribution of which is a zero-sum exercise. Immigrants are people and people are assets; they bring their creativity, energy, and culture to America for everyone's benefit. If that needs to be stated in terms one can measure with a dollar value, think of immigrants as sources of customer demand, stimulating employment. Immigrant-run restaurants and shops are a perfect example. Would native-born Americans be working at Chinese restaurants or Mexican bakeries if not for immigration? No, because those businesses wouldn't exist in the first place, and we'd all be worse off as a result. If those who call for America to exclude immigrants get their wish, the immigrants will benefit some other country, at which point these same pundits will predictably get their pants in a twist because ""Country X is beating us"" in education, employment, creativity, etc."

1285;4279;medical websites;1;1;to know what is wrong find out the truth be informed learn more;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to use them as a resource for self-diagnosis and preparation for medical advice.;I use what I consider to be sites backed by real research findings;I look up symptoms on the internet with the aim of discovering whether or not I need to see a doctor and if there is anything non-invasive I can do for myself either instead or in the meantime. I use what I consider to be sites backed by real research findings. I never decide I have some condition based on web research - only if what I am feeling means I need a doctor's advice. Often the articles ask other questions and considering the answers means I am more prepared to talk to the doctor if and when I do see her. I think this has served me well.
1286;10841;home deliveries;1;0;to have a healthy baby child be prepared for anything;the intention of the tweet is to express concern about the safety of home deliveries.;if she had the delivery at home she'd be dead right now;My wife was considered low risk. It was our second child, and the delivery went fine until she started bleeding after the placenta came out. After a few days in the ICU she was fine, but if she had the delivery at home she'd be dead right now. Is there a way to judge the risk of problems before labor? I have no idea. However, if something does happen during labor and delivery it'll happen fast, and wouldn't you rather be in a place that's prepared to deal with emergencies?
1287;1494;same-sex colleges;1;0;to get a good education better be person job leader;the author's intention towards same-sex colleges is to argue for the benefits of women's colleges, specifically in terms of gender integration and respect for women's opinions.;"CoEd colleges are not generally ""...gender-integrated places, where no one""";"The author's last sentence actually magpies a strong case for women's colleges. CoEd colleges are not generally ""...gender-integrated places, where no one is excluded and both sexes learn how to respect, collaborate with and lead each other through shared experience."" This is a nice fantasy but it is not reality. I was fortunate to go to an women's college in a curriculum where male students had to come to our turf. So I had the best of both worlds - the opportunity to study with men but in an environment where women's opinions and observations were honored because it was a women's college. PS. Having just finished ""I am Charlotte Simmons"" by Tom Wolfe, I think we have made the mistake of thinking that age is the equivalent of the emotional maturity necessary to live together and study together in a mutually beneficial way. If anything, we should have more segregation of the sexes through the college years - not less."
1288;13334;traveling with disease;1;0;to protect the public be safe safe. others;the intention of the tweet is to inform the target about the power of public health laws to remove individuals with infectious diseases from interstate transportation and the possibility of mandatory vaccination requirements in dire situations.;No one has control over their body in certain types of epidemics such as Ebola virus;I think Americans are woefully ignorant of the power of Public Health laws here. Everyone should visit a site on Google that will explain the right of officials to remove folks with various infectious diseases from Interstate Transportation, for example. No one has control over their body in certain types of epidemics such as Ebola virus, etc. They can be quarantined against their will. If the rate of vaccination for measles, for example, got much below what our CDC thought was minimal protection for the population at large, one might expect mandatory requirements for vaccination to be stiffened. There is such a thing as a greater good in dire situations.
1289;21751;defeating isi;1;2;to be a leader make profit optimistic save money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'defeating isi' is to challenge the assumption that the automobile industry will carry over its technological stagnation into a new propulsive means.;Mr. van Doren utterly disregards the ancillary improvements that will come;Mr. van Doren utterly disregards the ancillary improvements that will come when electric vehicles become a huge market, and automobile improvements begin to come from the realm of electronics and materials. He assumes, in effect, that the automobile industry will carry over its techological stagnation into a new propulsive means. But this is not true. In the first years of hybrids, many hackers have already gotten Priuses to run as plugins, increased their range, etc. I expect that battery technology will improve, incrementally, at a faster rate than any improvements in gasoline engines, and this disregards breakthroughs. The fact that there is significant commercial interest in electric vehicles at a point where they are marginally competitive is a vigorous and optimistic corner of a struggling economy.
1290;5656;vegetarianism;1;1;to avoid animal products be a vegetarian vegan save money healthy;the intention of the tweet is to promote vegetarianism as a way to avoid industrial animal products and improve quality.;Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets;Yes, quality does matter, but few people either have the time or money to seek out that quality. Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet. I, for one, can't bear the thought of a female pig in a gestation crate for all her adult life.
1291;18450;law;1;0;to be educated students learn something;critical;If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to;If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir.
1292;20577;walmart;1;2;to get rid of something away from it not be addicted;the user expresses strong opposition to marijuana, questioning its addictive qualities and criticizing those who support its prohibition with misinformation, while advocating for honesty and evidence-based decisions regarding drug policies.;I think putting it in candy is stupid;"I hate pot. I think putting it in candy is stupid. However, even though I gave it up after 2 years of thinking thee must be something wrong with me for not enjoying it, I came to the conclusion that it was so far from addictive that it probably drove some people to abandon it in favor of mindless drug like cocaine, heroin or beer and booze. If the AMA and foolish and misinformed people like MS Evins believe the nonsense they spread; let them sleep alone. I suspect that almost all hardcore users of pot are already using it. If Ms Evins were truly honest ,she would be pushing for re-enactment of alcohol prohibition, which , like all drug prohibitions, didn't work either, but was at least based upon a great deal of experimental and observed fact. All our history with marijuana is based upon the predilections of one side or the other in the argument over it's status."

My brother, sister, and I still talk about that trip - good memories. My wife and I always took our kids on vacations. We all had a great time and I hope that their memories of these trips is as fond as ours are. Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. ""In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!"""

We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran.
1297;13499;bank;1;0;to save money money. for retirement;the user expresses frustration with commercial banks and suggests separating investment banking and insurance from commercial banking, referencing the glass-steagall act, while also promoting credit unions.;banks would give prospective depositors a toaster to those who would open an account;Years ago, banks would give prospective depositors a toaster to those who would open an account. Now, prospective depositors must bring a toaster to the banks for the privilege of opening an account. How about let's start by getting commercial banks out of the investment banking business, the insurance business, by reinstating Glass-Stegall. Or better yet, take money out of the bank and put it in a credit union.
1298;1971;librarian;1;1;to be smart knowledgeable helpful learn;criticize the intention of the tweet towards librarian.;I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to;This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do.
1299;17508;kids;1;1;to be the best in control charge ignorant not bothered;the intention of the tweet towards 'kids' is to criticize their lack of interest in subjects they don't enjoy and encourage them to be ignorant.;allowing students to choose to be ignorant by only studying what they want to study is just sheer;"""One size does not fit all"" is a good sound byte. And trying to make students learn about and take an interest in subjects in which they have little or no interest is difficult. But allowing students to choose to be ignorant by only studying what they want to study is just sheer stupidity. We Americans are already THE most illiterate and ignorant bunch of ""educated"" human beings on the planet. But countries like Russia and China are certainly pleased with ""It's your right ot can be as stupid and ignorant as you want to"" mentality."
1300;19835;online course;1;2;to be a good parent better they want independent citizen learn;the user expresses criticism towards parents who choose to home-school, arguing they're shirking their societal obligation to pay school taxes and contribute to the public education system.;parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school;">> ""Many parents will purchase educational materials to use at home to foster a love of learning in their children."" That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means."
1301;18960;free marketplace;1;0;to be a good employee fair others worker employees;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for a more equitable arrangement in non-compete agreements that benefits the employee and allows them to participate in the free marketplace.;A more equitable arrangement would be to require the business owner to pay a premium for preventing;"""The Massachusetts judiciary retains the power under equity principles to reform such agreements when circumstances indicate that they may be impractical or unfair."" That, of course, assumes a former employee can afford the cost and hit to his reputation for bringing lawsuit against a former employer for an onerous non-compete. You mention these agreements protect the business owner, but I fail to see how they benefit the other party in the agreement, the employee, one iota. A more equitable arrangement would be to require the business owner to pay a premium for preventing his employees from selling their services in a free marketplace."
1302;9929;home birth versus hospital;1;1;to be in control have a baby doctor help;the intention of the tweet is to express a negative experience with a hospital birth and a preference for a home birth.;How large is the (significant) difference between outcomes for a baby born at home and one;How large is the (significant) difference between outcomes for a baby born at home and one born in the hospital? And, is it due to the inclusion in this data of incompetent midwives? I have known several women who gave birth at home, and wished to do so myself, but couldn't because of complications. My experience of birthing in a hospital with a male resident was quite unpleasant. He touched me and examined me without asking my permission. He said my membranes had not broken and I was urinating. Every woman who has experienced membranes breaking knows the difference. A woman/midwife wouldn't have done/said these things this. Childbirth is difficult enough without unempathic male doctors.
1303;2562;middle class college burden;1;0;to help the poor make money be rich;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration towards the perceived unfairness of the college burden being placed on white middle class students, who are paying rent for the state but not receiving any extra consideration or financial aid.;Who ends up getting the shaft? White middle class kids. Their parents are paying the rent for;So the solution is to throw yet more money at low income students, who's parents have likely not contributed to the tax base very much, keep bringing in foreign students who pay full price or more and for heavens sake keep paying the administrators millions. Who ends up getting the shaft? White middle class kids. Their parents are paying the rent for the state, they won't get any extra consideration for being a minority or being poor, and are going to have to shoulder more of the burden themselves. But they'll pay, because they're smart enough to know it's worth the sacrifice just as the schools are banking on.
1304;2790;speech;1;1;to get rid of someone be a good person him in control;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the firing of the individual for burning a country's flag and to argue that it is a slippery slope towards political correctness and fear of extremist muslims.;What he burned was nothing more than a'symbol;"I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol"", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: ""please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone."""
1305;4538;guy;1;0;to be healthy eat meat live longer fit;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'guy' is to criticize his argument and question his qualifications as an evolutionary biologist.;This argument is seriously flawed. What are this guy's qualifications? He's a;This argument is seriously flawed. What are this guy's qualifications? He's a chef, not an evolutionary biologist. Every living thing has evolved with certain traits that have enabled it to thrive. No, we may not have the speed and strength to kill a deer with our bare hands. But we have other evolutionary advantages that have enabled us to eat animals. Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet. If we weren't fit to eat animals we'd be extinct by now. Eating raw meat makes people sick because modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination. It's also the modern industrial diet that has lead to our current health problems (diabetes, heart disease, etc.) If people ate the way they did a hundred years ago and earlier (including eating meat) we'd all be a lot healthier. It's not meat that's the problem.
1306;4240;unemployement benefits;1;1;to be a leader get job fair successful make money;the intention of the tweet towards 'unemployment benefits' is to criticize the perverse incentives that discourage people from taking farming jobs.;unemployment benefits not tied to taking farming jobs;Finally, someone who wants to succeed within the context of our laws. We also need to look at perverse incentives, like unemployment benefits not tied to taking farming jobs. Keep up the good work, Mr. Shute. Hopefully, you will have less competition when your competitors who use illegal labor are put in jail.
1307;19212;happy hour;1;0;to be a good citizen person keep people safe responsible;the intention of the tweet towards 'happy hour' is to criticize the negative impact of drunk driving on public safety and suggest measures to address it.;I have no problem with Happy Hours;I have no problem with Happy Hours. I have a huge problem with drunken people in public trying to control a moving vehicle. We kill 35,000 people on the roads each year, making terrorism deaths look like a picnic from a public health perspective (though clearly not to those affected.) Perhaps a substantial part of the proceeds from liquor licensing should go to the hiring of additional cops to station in neighborhoods where bars are common. One could also require businesses that sell alcohol to have breathalyzers and post a sign saying that by entering a customer agreed to a breathalyzer test upon leaving. In general, however, what is needed is much greater enforcement of our traffic laws and penalties that have a chance to be effective as a deterrent across the board, including mandatory jail time for a D.U.I.
1308;16938;free speech;1;1;to express his opinion be heard heard. their opinions;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for free speech.;There appears to be nothing to prohibit their speaking about topics of interest to them;It is ridiculous to believe that Justices do not have opinions, vocalizing them or not, about many topics in their thoughts. If thoughts do not impact their professionalism, then spoken words should not. There appears to be nothing to prohibit their speaking about topics of interest to them.

I'm sure it's really neat for design firms to play around with their innovative theories on open plan offices and comfortable acoustics, but they won't be working there. Here's an idea on how to create an effective work environment, build more private offices/spaces.

Must be the influence of photo blogs!
1311;21220;lazy kid;1;2;to be a good citizen person parent educate their children his;the user expresses agreement with the idea that homeschooling can undermine public education, suggesting a critical stance on the perceived conservative trend towards homeschooling.;Homeschooling is a choice;So many have said it so well, I'll just reiterate the key point: Homeschooling is a choice. When one is part of a society, one must participate and contribute for the whole and good of the society. We have long understood that when our children are well educated, the society will benefit. I agree with earlier comments that this is another ultra-conservative gesture to undermine public education and create a culture that rejects facts in favor of religious values, as though one cannot exist with the other.
1312;2606;gene;1;0;to be in control have a monopoly charge make money;the intention of the tweet towards 'gene' is to criticize the patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences and its negative impact on medical care and innovation.;The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products;Every thing found in nature got to be by some kind of mutation and even engineered genes are now found in nature. The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.
1313;7458;capital gains;1;0;to help the poor save money be generous free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gains' is to suggest that eliminating taxes on capital gains would provide a big stimulus to the economy.;Something for nothing it is a beautiful American story, isn't it?;"The best way to spur economic growth is to eliminate taxes all together. That way, we get things like roads, schools, security, and healthcare for free, and the money saved will provide a big stimulus to the economy.

1314;17905;migration;1;0;to get a better job be good teacher make point. citizen learn about the world;the intention of the tweet is to express the author's opinion that migration is necessary for economically stressed countries to handle population growth and access wealth.;I would try migrating too if I were in such a country;I used to teach Quantitative Reasoning. One of the databases we used to analyze was birth rate by country. That was over ten years ago, but it showed my students how high birth rates would become unsustainable in small countries without similar economic growth rates. The same countries we identified as problems back in that course are in the center of the refugee and problematic youth crises now. Just divide the birth rate (in percentage) into 70 and you get the population doubling time. How can an economically stressed country every imagine handling the doubling of its population in less than a generation? It doesn't make any sense to talk about overall wealth in the world, either, when people have no realistic prospect of any future access to it without migrating. I would try migrating too if I were in such a country.

Most school librarians are already certified teachers, so this would not be a difficult transition. Librarians are involved in classroom instruction, but usually in the classroom of another teacher. Let's get research skills or information literacy into the mandated curriculum and protect our kids' libraries and librarians.

I've heard it all now. And as long as Israel defends nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage', Iran can also defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. So leave Iran alone as long as you allow Israel and any other country to defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. If the US and Israel want Iranian nuclear transparency, then Israel better be just as transparent.

Unless the people rise up and challenge this insanity, people like Rob Whittman will see to it that we leave our children with a very bleak future.

As long as Israel is blamed for the failure of negotiations, Palestinians will feel they have no reason to make any concessions to Israel, since the world says that Israel must give up territory and that Palestinians needn't do anything.
1324;5498;immigration;1;2;to make more money get a job money. earn;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the decline of moderate living-wage jobs has led to a shift in the job market, with immigrants taking on roles that were previously held by citizens who had no other choice.;low-paid immigration takes jobs from our own citizens;The reason many Americas feel low-paid immigration takes jobs from our own citizens is the decline of moderate living-wage jobs. Now, citizens who would typically have worked in factories and other unskilled roles have no choice but to move downstream into food service and lawn care. Twenty years ago when we still had a healthy job market, Mexicans were blowing leaves off lawns, skimming pools, and bussing tables for sub-minimum wage pay. No one complained that they were stealing work from citizens.

On my part even when the service is less than stellar I tip generously regardless. Serving the general public is a very hard job and deserves consideration especially if one can afford the extra.
1326;11130;new employees;1;1;to get rid of someone competition be a good employee make money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'new employees' is to express frustration and disappointment about the non-compete clause in employment contracts.;non-competes used;If they were protecting small business that would be fine but that is not how I have seen them. I currently work for a sub 100 person company and we tried to hire someone who had been let go from a competitor 9 months earlier. The competitors was a large global company based in MA. We received a threatening letter from them about the non-compete. Because they are big and have more in annual profit than we have in annual revenue, we knew we could not challenge them in court and so we had to rescind the offer to the currently unemployed individual. This is how I have seen non-competes used.
1327;2988;syria;1;0;to be in power control charge win;the intention of the tweet towards syria is to express fear and opposition to any us intervention in the country, as it may lead to regime change and massacre of certain groups, and ultimately increase the slaughter of all non-sunis.;any attack by the US will be in violation of the laws will leads like the Libyan intervention;I fear that any attack by the US will be in violation of the laws will leads like the Libyan intervention to move on to regime change. There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change. They don't care that the US is broke and we have lots of problems at home. They have their eyes fixed on getting rid of Assad and they don't care about the US at all.

I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision.

A pet cat kept indoors does not need its claws. If I have to keep a pet cat I would insist on declawing it. Otherwise I would forgo the pleasure of having a cat as a pet, no matter how cuddly.

The greatest humans to live in the 20th Century Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King, Jr, were not Catholic let along saints. Dietrich Bonhoffer was Catholic. So were Isabella and Ferdinand. Alexander Hamilton, John Brown and Abraham Lincoln were not Catholics nor saints.

I don't believe Vatican City is asking for the opinion of non-Catholics, atheists, agnostics, and followers of other religions. So, go ahead Catholic Church, canonize her. I'll spend my time worrying about other things.

The gate-way drugs are prescription meds found in medicine cabinets everywhere. Heroin is a lot less expensive than marijuana and if marijuana were legal, and less expensive, fewer people would want heroin.

Too expensive, not worth it, only die-hard environmentalists will buy them and lose money, etc. Yet today look at all the hybrids on the road. And the cost has come down. Is the Volt the answer to our car problems? Of course not. But maybe by starting to realize that gasoline isn't the only way to power a car, it'll lead to hydrogen-powered cars or fuel cells or who knows maybe a technology that doesn't even exist yet. More options are always better!

It's really hard to build something when you have to deal with someone else trying to tear it down at the same time.

I have had 3 births, the first 2 were in the hospital, and my 3rd was at home. I had awful experiences in the hospital with feeling like my freedom was taken away. I felt like I was shackled to the bed from the moment I walked in. My home birth was by far the best decision I have ever made. The experience is almost indescribable. Don't get me wrong, my first 2 births are special to me only because it was the moment my beautiful children came into this world. I just wish I knew then what I know now. With my home birth, I had an absolutely wonderful midwife who monitored me, but also aloud me to have control and let my body do what it was meant to do: give birth. Pregnancy is not a sickness, and I refuse to allow it to be treated as such.

1342;7723;oil spills;1;0;to be a good person citizen save the environment safe;the intention of the tweet is to question the publication of a lobbyist without considering their potential influence on best practices for oil spills, and to reflect on the lessons learned from past incidents in the gulf and the atlantic.;In the late 1950s there was an oil tanker incident in the Atlantic. All I remember;Why was this lobbyist published without at least asking them we they won't also lobby for true best practices. We learned in the gulf what can go wrong. Well the Atlantic is stormier. So what new technology exists to quickly contain a spill? In the late 1950s there was an oil tanker incident in the Atlantic. All I remember about it is my mother bringing nail polish remover to the beach to clean off the tar balls from our legs.

Charter schools offer families without the funds to pay for private school a similar environment and the opportunity to be surrounded by other students whose parents value their education and have been socialized to behave appropriately in school.
1344;2088;medical websites;1;0;to know the truth be informed facts educated;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to criticize the incorrect information provided by some websites and to appreciate the reliable information provided by others.;I basically avoid forums as they are full of the anecdotal gibberish;When my husband was diagnosed with late stage, very aggressive prostate cancer 13 years ago, I did turn to the internet. I went to respected, reliable web sites. I got enough knowledge from them to help us choose a urologist as at least 2 of the 4 we interviewed, told us information that was just plain incorrect. They tried to sugar coat his disease when we needed facts. Finally, we found a doctor who listened to us and then told us what we needed to know. I basically avoid forums as they are full of the anecdotal gibberish of people who often are very uneducated but very opinionated. The only thing I ever learned on them was about a specialists at Columbia Presbyterian (we did see him) and how to travel with my percussion vest on small planes. My pulmonologist appreciates that I do know a great deal about my disease and that I know my body very well. I appreciate that he knows a great deal more about medicine than I do. Together, we keep me in pretty decent shape.

Corporate law breakers may be subject to fines but rarely prison terms. The Board of directors is a good place to start handing out personal responsibility.

1347;18700;american unemployment;1;0;to have a better life get deal rid of jobs save money.;criticize;There is a correlation between our high unemployment rate and outsourcing;I'm sick of proponents glorifying the benefits of outsourcing because Americans have lost their jobs, thanks to lobbyists, political leanings and Wall Streets' focus on the bottom line. There is a correlation between our high unemployment rate and outsourcing. Off-shoring is the appropriate word but when you are one of the millions whose job is gone, off-shoring and outsourcing mean the same thing: no job. The biggest fear now is that when Tea Partiers and Republicans finish taking the government apart with the rataionale of getting spending under control, unemployment may be higher. Because outsourcing has the mantra of cheapest and lowest cost, our neighbors and children pay the cost. The wages paid in India, China, Brazil are not enough to support American lifestyles, communities and housing. Having seen the devastation that outsourcing has done to communities I've traveled to, I no longer support it. The devastating cost has long outweighed the benefits.
1348;9738;homicides down;1;1;to know the truth understand situation facts be safe;the intention of the tweet is to inform the target that the homicide rate is lower than it has ever been, and that the news often reports on high-profile murders, leading people to believe the murder rate is higher than it actually is.;homicide is way down;Obama is absolutely right. But it's not just death in war - homicide is way down. People think that the murder rate is high because the news tells us about horrible murders. It is a fact that the homicide rate is lower than it has ever been: you were far more likely to die by murder in every other era. We have the data for Western Europe going back about 1000 years, and the murder rate is lower than its ever been. Even hunter gatherers, whom we like to glorify as living peaceful, natural lives, had higher murder rates than we do.
1349;7548;rich politicans;1;0;to be a good person citizen get rid of people make point;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the way rich politicians use their power and influence to avoid accountability and maintain their corrupt practices.;he who has the gold, rules;"Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call ""corruption"" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a ""you wash my back and I'll wash yours"" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible."
1350;8525;immigration;1;1;to be a leader make difference inclusive patriotic;the intention of the tweet towards target 'immigration' is to criticize the focus on trivial debates and the need for more global thinking, while also highlighting the importance of remembering the country's immigrant roots and the sacrifices made by family members in wars.;America was founded by immigrants;As a native NY'r with Irish & Italian roots I am now married to a French national and living in France. This debate seems so trivial. And I am a patriot who has family members who actually fought for our country, infantry in the world wars & vietnam, unlike some presidents. America was founded by immigrants but oddly we often forget that, especially some politicians, as they fight for the scraps offered to them by these sorts of useless debates. Finally all this fosters are the borders that we put up. Perhaps if we dropped some useless defenses we could get on with thinking more globally, to provide our children with a broader view, habitat, and life. And maybe get past this tech & media frenzied pace that it (we?) seem to have created? Not sure but I think there may be bigger fish to fry.

BUT Single Payer, while reasonable, and what every other Western country considers a right, is just never gonna happen here...look what they are doing in response to this less-than-perfect minor changes that is trying to get more people covered. Pathetic.
1352;7356;women;1;1;to have a child family be parent independent happy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'women' is to encourage them to delay having children if they want to pursue their career ambitions and enjoy other activities.;A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late;I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space.
1353;1059;term papers;1;1;to prove a point make theory be leader understood;the intention of the tweet towards target 'term papers' is to argue that the rigor of term papers is essential in training young minds to think clearly.;all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did;The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.
1354;5196;export;1;0;to make a point be in control leader power;the intention of the tweet towards target 'export' is to criticize the reliability and accuracy of information being presented by experts in the middle east region.;"It is getting very tiresome hearing ""experts"" such as Abrahms repeat the lie";"It is getting very tiresome hearing ""experts"" such as Abrahms repeat the lie that Assad never harmed Americans. During the American occupation of Iraq, Assad sent thousands of Jihadis to kill US soldiers and Iraqi civilians. These Jihadis were responsible for the worst atrocities of the Iraq war. Only last year, Assad's chief Mufti threatened Europe with ""suicide bombers"". His father Hafez was responsible for the killing of 241 US marines in a suicide attack on their barracks in Lebanon. ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is, apparently, what passes for analysis on the Middle East these days. It is a platitude by which not a single government in the Middle East has ever been known to set its policies by."

What in the;"I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology."

I did not want to lose my allegiance to my mother country, however i also wanted to take advantage of all the wonderful oppertunities this country has to offer because they were not available to me back home. Its a privelage that should not be taken advantage of.

It is most important to teach respect for others, particularly fellow students who are there to learn not to be disrupted and distracted by this sort of thing. Freedom has become a useless trope in our society because we attach no responsibility to it. Long ago when I was attending an excellent public school we students would not have tolerated a person like the one you describe and let me say we were a remarkably tolerant class.

Look s recently as states which have just had primary elections during spring break. The sands of Florida and the beer was much more important than to stay in their districts to vote. Don't count on them to bone of any help except the occasional rally as a relief agent to distract from classes.

The standard should be raised so that people who are not fit to be lawyers don't waste their time on a profession that will not be good for them or their clients.

We have enough lousy attorneys, Dean Allard wants to create more? Generally, my classmates who took the bar multiple times ended up where they belong, at the bottom rung of the profession.

Muslims are sensitive to their own beliefs and values, but seemingly have no respect whatsoever for anyone else's religion or beliefs. You get what you give. You don't give respect to others, not even lip service you don't get any respect.
1363;9632;a way to sell what was once free;1;0;to understand the economics situation business be fair understood;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the practice of charging hidden fees for services that were once free, and to suggest that it is a way to sell what was once free.;an attempt add hidden fees;"How about the quant idea of respect for PATRONS, not attitude and an attempt add hidden fees (a la movie ticket 'service fees')?

Because the reward system is skewed away from the very very hard work of the great classroom teacher. I understand that the idea is to use these talented few to create more great teachers.

The decision of well-meaning but ignorant people to deprive their children of vaccinations endangers not just the children, but the children of others, and vulnerable adults.

1367;14363;homework;1;1;to learn more be productive prepared;the intention of the tweet towards target 'homework' is to argue for an extension of the school day to reduce the amount of homework and improve sleep quality.;I average 8 hours of homework every night with 6-7 hours of school in a day.;I'm in my Junior year in High School, and I take the hardest courses my school offers. I average 8 hours of homework every night with 6-7 hours of school in a day. I also work about 3 hours a day. I do not sleep. I spend most of my weekend sleeping, until Sunday where I do 12 hours of homework. I love school and I love learning, and I'd argue the school day needs to be extended. The teachers do not have enough time to teach us all we need to know, especially in AP courses. Thus, we have an incredible amount of homework, depriving us of sleep, and leading to the negative consequences Ms. Carskadon warns. So, as long as teachers have more time to teach while at the same time giving less homework, I'm all for extending the school day.
1368;5081;public workers;1;1;to make a point statement be leader respectful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'public workers' is to defend the right to free expression of the transit worker who burned a koran.;the transit worker should not have been fired;"Why is this such an important issue? Muslims should be sensible, diplomatic in their thoughts & actions; and not let this or any similar acts to be used as provocation. Let them burn a few Koran - heck, let them burn a few million copies. Burning some Korans certainly wouldn't weaken Islam. And didn't Allah said that ""I have sent you 'The Book' and I will protect it""? So why are we so threatened by some misguided acts of a few ignorant people and let the detractors sully Islam's name? On another note, the transit worker should not have been fired. It was a private, non-violent act, and if it gave him peace of mind let him have it. Muslims should even urge the transit authority to reinstate him. And it should be remembered that if we gladly accept that denying of someone's right to free expression now out of expediency; then we must also be prepared to accept the same fate in future."

Many of us do. It has helped me determine that I didn't need treatment for subconjunctival hemorrhage, but that my daughter probably had pneumonia after a serious viral infection, and needed treatment. Using a website to substitute for knowledge that takes a physician a minimum of ten years to acquire is nuts. Using a website to gain general information is not. I know the adage - "" A little learning is a dangerous thing"" - but no knowledge is pretty dangerous too. Adjust to the era. Information is out there. Support efforts to teach people how to use it."

One only has to pick up the newspaper to read of;The world already has too many people. One only has to pick up the newspaper to read of thousands of people risking their necks to move to countries who do not want them in order to better their standard of living. A good example of overpopulation is Haiti. Haitian have too many babies. Their people try to migrate to other countries who spend resources to find such immigrants and deport them.

The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be ""cut out?"

This 'Food Babe' (neat commercial!) seems to think that her personal campaigns forced some mega food companies to change their labels. Consumer protest works, but not when it is a solo effort. A bit much self-promotion here. 2. This debate is about one word, ""natural."" Language is too complex for the debate to be about one word. The issue is can claiming in the name that something is not present. It defies logic to state in a product name that lemon is in the product when in fact there is no lemon at all. That is simply misleading (bold face lying). ""Lemon"" in common nomenclature is something that comes from the lemon plant, not it's laboratory produced analog. Isn't truth in advertising the issue? 3. My food slogan is ""I'm very careful about what I put in my mouth."" So that unfortunately means every label must be scrutinized."

Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants."" That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a ""net employment gain""? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works."

Sex work - oldest profession - is not going away. Reduces AIDS and STDs when controlled. Half the celebrities are sex workers of sorts selling their bodies so why not the ones who actually have sex be allowed. Not everyone wants to do that. It has a strange effect on the psyche of women. An act made for bonding and love done with people you dont like - messes with the mind.

I had no idea it still existed. I taught for almost 30 years in a good high school here and can't remember a single student going to Sweet Briar after graduation. I wonder who the students were and where they came from.
1377;16378;gateway drugs;1;0;to stay away from drugs be a good person citizen alcohol not get in trouble;the intention of the tweet towards target 'gateway drugs' is to argue that prescription drugs, such as opioids, are more dangerous than commonly perceived and contribute to heroin addiction and overdose deaths.;The real gateway drugs are prescribed by doctors;The real gateway drugs are prescribed by doctors. Those are dangerous and we are seeing the fallout from increased heroin addiction and overdose death. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be used too frequently, or used at times when we need to be sober, like during work or before operating a vehicle. And children most definitely should not partake. Alcohol can be just as dangerous as any drug. Even though the majority of citizens do not abuse alcohol, there are some among us who simply cannot drink responsibly. There will be some who cannot use marijuana responsibly either, but I don't think policy should be written for those who abuse a substance. That is not effective policy.

They most certainly don't care about the flying public/customer. This is reflected in the faces of all who are shoehorned and buckled into tiny seats. Like all other jobs today we humans are disposable workers, flight attendants included. I can handle a surly or neglectful attendant on occasion for it is a tough, demanding position but we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots. This worries me tremendously having worked for the airlines in the past. These mostly highly trained professionals are being abused and not paid decently. Don't get me wrong cabin crews are important but the person in the cockpit can not be marginalized or treated poorly. I think we can all agree that safe, happy and well rested and trained pilots are crucial to the business.

There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change. They don't care that the US is broke and we have lots of problems at home. They have their eyes fixed on getting rid of Assad and they don't care about the US at all.

A lot has changed since then. The religious right backs Israel for ideological reasons and Israel itself has moved a long way to the right. Obama is resisting efforts to drag the US into military action against Iran but Romney/Ryan are eager for it. Your conditions for success, a plan for peace and relationships with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians based on trust and confidence, are unlikely to be met anytime soon.
1382;9811;teachers;1;1;to make more money get a job earn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'teachers' is to express sympathy for the challenges faced by charter school teachers, including low salaries, heavy workload, and poor working conditions.;Charter schools do not offer competitive salaries. In addition, charter school teachers have more duties and longer;I am in my 9th year teaching, and yes, I feel sorry for the students I had my first year. I am a good teacher today, and it did take about 5 years to reach that point. I have never worked in a charter school, but I did once interview at one (and decline the job offer), and I know several teachers who currently work at charters. Charter schools do not offer competitive salaries. In addition, charter school teachers have more duties and longer hours in school, so, after factoring in daily lesson planning on top of their extended hours, they work much longer, in poorer conditions (the shiny buildings don't mean good work conditions) with much lower salaries. No education professional actually believes that charter schools are hiring superior teachers.
1383;19807;same sex college;1;2;to be a good parent get education job better have;the user questions the perceived unfairness of tax credits for homeschoolers, suggesting it may incentivize inadequate home education to receive state funds, comparing it to perceived welfare abuse.;if I send my kids to a private school, in most states, I do not;If I send my kids to a private school, in most states, I do not get any form of a tax credit. Yet I still pay taxes to support the public schools. Why should home-schoolers be treated any differently? How will this prevent a bunch of families from having children, giving them the bare minimum of education at home to pass the tests (if testing is implemented), and then receiving a big check in the mail from state? How is this any different from welfare?
1384;9598;college rating scale;1;1;to be a leader in control the best successful;the intention of the tweet is to support the implementation of a college rating scale.;It's good to see that the educational bureaucracy is falling into line behind this;It's good to see that the educational bureaucracy is falling into line behind this proposal. Laggards and doubters can surely be brought around by the prospect of generous federal grants to develop ratings systems models and protocols and test them on various institutional cohorts. The primary goal of education is, of course, is to produce uniform and interchangeable cogs for the economic machine, so that it will hum smoothly and predictably. A college ratings system will extend the infallible testing paradigm into whole new realms, taking our country to heretofore unimaginable new heights of sameness. The wise sages at the Business Roundtable and the Gates Foundation will love it. The great successes of the primary and secondary school testing models can now be applied to the entire educational system. Victory is almost in our grasp.
1385;15196;terrorist acts;1;0;to have more people be inclusive helpful help;the intention of the tweet towards target 'terrorist acts' is to express frustration and a sense of injustice towards the perceived lack of gratitude and entitlement of muslim immigrants, and to question the benefits of accepting more of them.;all we gotten for our generosity has been terrorist acts and a truly astounding sense of in;What is in it for Europe or the US to accept more Muslim immigrants, when all we gotten for our generosity has been terrorist acts and a truly astounding sense of ingratitude and entitlement? What is in it for us? And why is that not the first question that is asked?
1386;11155;law;1;1;to be a leader in control make money profit;the intention of the tweet towards target 'law' is to advocate for legalization of marijuana and its regulation, taxation, and education.;We are slowly now heading in the right direction - ending the biggest and most widespread wrongful;"""Marijuana Is Now Big Business"" Wrong - marijuana has been big business for decades. The California Dept. of Agriculture has listed it as the number one cash crop in the state for over 20 years in a row. Now, the business is above ground, where it should be. Regulation, taxation, better education, savings in enforcement and incarceration costs - everybody wins. We are slowly now heading in the right direction - ending the biggest and most widespread wrongful jailing of American citizens since slavery. It can't happen quick enough."
1387;4097;the war on drugs;1;0;to be a good person get rid of drugs citizen something;criticizes the effectiveness of the war on drugs and its negative impact on society.;the war on drugs is a failure;. Do alcohol and marijuana affect some users negatively? Absolutely. Should minors be allowed to legally consume either one? No. But the war on drugs is a failure. All it does is promote violence and enrich big time drug dealers and the utterly corrupt interdiction apparatus both in the U.S. and abroad. I don't endorse the use of either marijuana or alcohol. But making them illegal protects no one.
1388;6174;deaf;1;1;to communicate with others someone people be understood;the intention of the tweet towards target 'deaf' is to criticize the inadequacy of english education for deaf children and to promote cochlear implants and cued speech as a more effective means of communication.;I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed;"I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be."
1389;21129;government funded school;1;2;to be a leader get things done in control make point;the user expresses opposition to the us embargo against cuba, viewing it as a relic of the cold war that has not benefitted anyone.;it is time! It should have been done long ago;Of course it is time! It should have been done long ago. How has the embargo benefitted us or the Cubans or any of the past participants over the years? It has not. It is a foolish remnant of a Cold War which ended long ago in a different time and existed in a much different world. Foolish saber-rattling by foolish people in a foolish effort. The embargo belongs in history books, not on our back porch.
1390;8006;war against isil;1;1;to help the people be cautious careful avoid conflict;the intention of the tweet is to support the kurds in the war against isil and to wait for the pieces to fall before taking any further action.;Let the Sunnis that have allied with ISIL get to know them a bit;Just because ISIL currently has the support of the local Sunni populace, does not mean this will last. Let the Sunnis that have allied with ISIL get to know them a bit better, and I am sure resistance will form eventually. The focus should be on supporting the Kurds only, like President Obama is doing right now. In these situations, patience is of the utmost importance. Let us see where the pieces fall first. There is no need to rush into anything. The current air support of the Kurdish Forces and supplying only them with sophisticated weaponry should be the strategy, nothing more and nothing less.
1391;11674;small farms;1;0;get a better job to they;the intention of the tweet towards target'small farms' is to acknowledge their success and positive impact on the local community.;Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops;Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.
1392;6644;isreal;1;1;to be in control power a leader change the subject;criticizes israel for its role in the stalemate between israel and palestine, and calls for a change in the status quo.;We are so retarded!!!;So after all this time, nothing has changed, it brings to mind Israel and Palestine. Stalemate. So this is just a game of 'chicken'. Does that benefit the citizens of either of our countries? Is this progress or stagnation? Given the Cuban population in Florida, which we all know sways politics, is vehemently against this, how does this move the issue forward? Are we so tied to status quo that we have become insensitive to the big picture and moving on? We do business with China,-- big business, by the way. So how hypocritical is this? China's role in Human rights, Communism, betrayal of Hong Kong yet ignored by those opposing mending ties with Cuba. What is wrong with this picture? We need to dig into the real reason for this standoff. How immature are we? What is the real reason? Human rights can only be served by changing the movie. We are so retarded!!!
1393;951;violent criminals;1;0;to be a good citizen person safe fair;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for a longer time limit for background checks on violent criminals.;there should be a time limit for back ground checks, 6 months for non violent misdem;No, ban the box is not enough there should be a time limit for back ground checks, 6 months for non violent misdemoners, 2 years for non violent felonies. and a longer time for violent crimes depending upon the crime. People need to work and have a job and have a place to live.
1394;4519;school meal guidelines;1;0;to be the best a leader make money competitive;the intention of the tweet is to express the belief that the new school meal guidelines from usda will be more effective in encouraging manufacturers to develop new products that meet the guidelines while maintaining taste, and will level the playing field for school meal sales.;The new school meal guidelines from USDA will be far more of a game changer than anything Wal;The new school meal guidelines from USDA will be far more of a game changer than anything WalMart does. They also will be far more effective in terms of giving manufacturers good reason to invest the money and effort to develop new products that meet the guidelines while maintaining taste. The fact is, such products on the shelves of WalMart will always have the competition from less healthy products such as you allude to. If you want to sell the vast school market, the playing field will be level. The real question is whether local school boards will accept the idea that they can't use school food programs to cross subsidize education, and that Federal school meal reimbursements need to go towards school meal production, not school bureacracy overheads.
1395;5589;tax breaks;1;0;to be fair get rich help others;criticize tax breaks for the rich.;tax breaks for the rich have hurt New York City;Of course tax breaks for the rich have hurt New York City--and perhaps the country. These tax breaks reveal the basis of inequality--subsidies for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. That many of the wealthy taking advantage of these policies are foreigners only adds to the problem. Everyone would gain from making these wealthy moochers pay their fair share.

The US involved in one way or the other in every conflict in the 20th century. Fortunately, the end for that arrogant attitude is coming to an end. The era of US supremacy is coming to an end.
1397;6909;critical thinking skills;1;1;to be helpful help students teach;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of developing critical thinking skills in high school english assignments, even with the growth of technology.;When I taught high school English, the primary goal of the assignment was the development of the students;The growth of technology does not negate the necessity for research papers and essays. When I taught high school English, the primary goal of the assignment was the development of the students' analytical/critical thinking skills. As the abundance of information increased on the Internet, my instruction included a discussion of acceptable sites for use in the preparation of a paper. As Matt, # 9, said, the problems described by Mr. Bauerlein would not occur with a carefully designed assignment. As for student use of cutting and pasting, in many high schools, students are required to submit papers electronically using a site, such as Turnitin.com, that identifies passages that students may have copied..

ISIS might not yet be the existential threat posed by the Axis powers but it is heading that way. Point being that we should do whatever is necessary short of WMD to defeat this evil. Even if it means cooperating with Assad whose regime, while brutal, poses no threat to the US.
1400;382;vaccination;1;1;to protect their child his children avoid disease;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination and to argue that the decision not to vaccinate a child affects not only that child but also others.;The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false;Brandeis University should be embarrassed to have given a post to someone who employs such specious reasoning. The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false. A mother's decision whether to breastfeed affects only her child's health. Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other children and adults. In our society, parents can perceive that any risks, however minuscule and unproven, outweigh benefits of vaccination only because other individuals have agreed to vaccinate their children and thereby reduce or eliminate risk of a communicable disease in a population.
1401;19110;punishment for felons after paying their debt;1;1;to be a good person get out of jail citizen prison trouble;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the continuation of punishment for felons after they have completed their sentences.;If felons complete their sentences, their punishment should be over;If felons complete their sentences, their punishment should be over. It's bad enough that they can't get hired. Punishment continues because they can't be full citizens even though they've paid their debts to society. No wonder there is so much recidivism.

Non-patentable. Stored in a bloodbank?;By Mr Mossoff's reasoning, naturally occurring non-isolated electricity (e..g, in thunderstorms) would not be patentable, but any use in a house would be. Similarly, rainwater would not be patentable, but water inside a building's plumbing system would be. Blood inside the body? Non-patentable. Stored in a bloodbank? Patentable! Fingernails could be grown without fear of lawsuit, but at the moment they are clipped, they would be the subject of litigation? Absurd, to say the least.

In this day and age of the Internet, for Ms.;I imagine that Maureen Dowd's column, written after she ate a whole 420-laced candy car, is the impetus for this Room for Debate. I found that column astonishing. In this day and age of the Internet, for Ms. Dowd not to have educated herself a teeny-tiny bit felt more like behavior contrived to produce a compelling column than behavior in the real world. All I could think of from her column was the old Alka-Seltzer commercial. There are always going to be people who drink to the point of vomiting/hangover their first time out. They learn. And I bet if Ms. Dowd does it again, she won't eat the whole thing.

These are tough times there's lot's to be;"#21 is right so far as this is a legal issue re. employee/employer. But enough's enough. Let people speak their minds. These are tough times; there's lot's to be upset about. Less repression and less what's essentially sanctimonious PR by the complainers might do us more good in the long run. The point of a right to free speech is precisely that some people's opinions about important things are bound to offend (i.e., really offend) some other people (and draw negative attention). So, we (the right thinking one's among us) are offended, uncomfortable, squirming; get over it."

I have used opioids for 12 years and I have not increased that amount in all that time because I studied up on pain medication and addiction. Not one doctor over that time told me one thing that I learned in my own. I know more than most doctors. Doctors are passing out pills they don't understand and their patients have even a less understanding how to use them. No wonder why there is a big problem.

The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying ""gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time"". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable ""land before peace"" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves."

The embargo has throttled down major trade along the Mississippi affecting trade from New Orleans to Chicago. The lost trade and development is astronomical. We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies. US policy is driven by emotion rather than any realistic policy that might bring about change. How long must the people of the United States be forced to maintain a foolish policy driven by the self interests of a small politically connected community?

For right now, however, what the US needs to to is become selfish and self-centered, in the realpolitik. We have way too many things wrong with this country to cast stones. Jobs, out of control USG eavesdropping, political candidates who eyes show no truth, only $ signs,, etc ad nauseum. Israel and its supporters have been crippling the US for far too long, and they've now found another hook in the form of Iran. Israel has controlled ... yes, controlled! our role in the Middle East for far too long. We need to preserve this country while we still have one.

There was a time when the Church was against translating the Bible. (you can't have access to that, you're too much of an idiot!) The matter of the fact is that doctors now have to do their homework and be prepared to answer tough questions. Excellent!

The U.S.'s vast arms industry helps kills women, children, and decimates the natural environment. All war brings suffering, pain, and disease. I studied tropical medicine in London and was sickened to learn to care for the horrific wounds inflicted by almost exclusively U.S.-made weapons. When will we ever learn?

My ideal solution would be to take a vacation without the kids ~and~ the husband. Of course, you don't know my family. You think that's heartless and selfish until I explain that I live with the exasperating reality of a husband with mental illness and five step-kids two of whom also have mental illness, who spend the majority of their time with a mom who has very low standards for her own behavior let alone theirs. Yeah, I know- it's my bed, I'll lie in it. But a couple nights to lie in it alone would be nice.

What's the difference between this now, where the;How to start re regulating? What's the difference between this now, where the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks, despite public opinion, and the banking S&L crisis when hundreds were prosecuted and jailed? Clinton started the deregulation of banks in the 90s. Lobbying and campaign donations have hugely increased, esp since the 2010 court decision. How can the govt untangle itself from the corporate hold on its powers? It's as if the govt is really regulated by the banks and corporations, rather than the govt regulating the banks. And all in the name of 'free speech' and free private enterprise. And in this bad economy with huge unemployment, the banks threaten more joblessness and recession if they are not left to do as they please. Where's the rebuttal in our main media? The majority of the public is anti big bank and want to break them up. The democracy isn't working.

What if a public employee even publishes a comment;RC is right. What if a public employee even publishes a comment supporting the right to burn the Koran on the New York Times website? Does that mean the government should fire him or her? This dangerous precedent will lead to the stifling of free expression and censorship throughout the country.

Facebook is a democratization of the news in the sense that you can find stories and opinions that the corporate media are too afraid or intimidated or just plain arrogantly refusing to cover. Bernie Sanders is just one example NYT. Please wake up and do the right thing before you become irrelevant.

And, gasp!,;I know a number of organic farmers in upstate NY. And, gasp!, they manage to grow and harvest crops without illegal labor. They do this and still make a profit.

As an attorney who's taken and passed some of the hardest bar exams in the nation, I will tell you that bar exams are not that hard. If you can't pass them, then you don't deserve to practice. Law schools need to quit whining about the bar and take a long look in the mirror. Either find better students, take fewer of them, or tank your ranking. Either way, blaming the system is just excuse-making.

They do not address his politics, but his mental incompetence. She poses the matter of listening with some attentiveness to the village idiot, but should he be allowed to run the town?

This is easily demonstrable -- as follows: A person is an adherent to a new religion. This religion believes that the holy books of three large monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have been corrupted, have errors and therefore must be cleansed. The required cleansing is done by fire. Each Sabbath, adherents must burn one page of each of the holy books for these faiths. It is a bona-fide belief helf by adherents to this faith. If the government prevents them from conducting their cleansing ceremony because others are offended, then it is clearly taking sides on what does and does not constitute acceptable religous beliefs and practices.

They will go the way of school nurses and school psychologists. Soon there will be only the dull hum of programmed learning on electronic media with not human interaction except at recess. All our kids and grandkids will be the losers.

Our public elementary school in Brooklyn, NY has hardly any computers. There isn't even one for students to use in our library to access our partially-automated card catalog, so I hope our librarian remains to help children find books.

Why? Facebook provides no context for the news and most readers cannot provide it either. Facebook news may or may not reflect world or local truth. Traditionally, newspapers provided both news--the what, where and when--and the context--the how and why. That is disappearing. Even the NY Times does not report the religion of attackers and attacked in the Middle East. As a result, ask most Americans and they have little clue that the fighting is sectarian. Where are the facts about the free college platform the Bern has been advocating? Where is the money needed to keep college doors open? ""Who cares, just let me in for free!"""

When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, ""We weren't offered any other options."" When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, ""If you do that, your children won't be your friends,"" we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal."

In practice, it will be a waste of money. Many reviews are conducted in many areas by the feds but the politics, ability of staff whom review, understanding of what they are reviewing, implementation, initial results and then white washing the results leaves much to be desired. The federal government does not have the capability for many reasons to rate. Maybe it should start rating its own departments from an independent and non-political (if that is possible) and address its issues first.

The indisputable fact that here is not Japan has presumably nothing to do with whether tipping is good or not. If it does, the onus is on the writer to say why it is so. Was the author thinking in terms of stereotypes of Japanese workers who act like robots and thus need no feedback or incentives? Like Mr. Shaw wrote in another opinion in this series, there are many places with excellent service and no tips, thus proving that there are other ways of providing feedback and incentives to the staff."

The electric car can travel 100 miles on a charge. The Civic can travel 500 miles on one tank of gasoline, the gasline is readily available, and a fillup takes only about 3 minutes. Driving 5000 miles a year, the payback time for an electric car would exceed the life expectancy of the car itself.

If law graduates are as well-prepared as Dean Allard implies, then they should pass the bar exam with ease. The fact that so many don't pass demonstrates the continued need for the exam.

The highest is the Seychelles islands ... an outlier that is not far ahead of us. Our broken system can't be fixed all at once. We will have to fix it piece at a time just like it was broken piece at a time. But making EX-felons whole in their participation in society by restoring their voting rights is a good start.

Beware of the man who promises more than anyone can possibly deliver: ""Ideally, the rating and performance-based funding system would drive states, institutions and students toward the transformative change needed to tame student loan debt and jump-start social mobility."" Yeah, right. As if. We have an increasingly unequal society. Parents and students are afraid they won't learn what they need for success. Educational ranking, in that environment of fear, pushes schools into offering quicker graduation, streamlined curricula, and narrower and more uniform education, in order to prove they can hit their numbers. Student learning cannot easily be measured. So it will be neglected in favor of what can be measured. What this guy is advocating is harmful to students and harmful to education. But it looks like it's the future."

If I could not adopt adult declawed cats, I could not have a cat. I've had three (two at the moment). They've all been different but not disturbed. They are great joys. If you oppose declawing, feel free not to declaw and not to adopt a declawed cat. If you want to campaign against declawing, go for it. But, do you really need the government to ban it?

Not so well, when the provider of the goods and services is able to hide price behind layers of obfuscation and indirection. The airlines, very much like health care insurers and providers, make it almost impossible to know up front what you are buying and what it will cost. Just like health care insurers and providers, the purchaser of air transportation is often a business with a different set of priorities from those of the ultimate consumer --- we the people. Under those circumstances, only intelligent and knowledgeable regulation can work.

But definitely leaving behind much of the education that makes life and conversation with others fascinating. Business majors may avoid fine arts, literature, language and history. Those aspects of education are handy when dealing with people of other cultures. If politicians during the Bush push for war had had even conversations with journalists in the Middle East for a decade or more, they may have had some grasp of the enormous tribal and religious ties therein, and perhaps have not proceeded so. The society of the nineteenth and twentieth century was fostered by education that was broad and deep. By the 1990's and later, music and art were narrowing and the ability to discriminate what was good was replaced by what was accepted. We are dropping old attitudes and replacing them with fashion. The ability to discern and choose what is good is set aside for the rush to be considered aware and clever, and worse, cool.

Anybody can do the job. Ha! Within two to three years, the majority of TFA are looking for any way to get out of the classroom. Some of the more notable failures, such as DC's Michele Rhee, then can parley their brief unsuccessful experiences into becoming superintendants of major school districts. This is called school reform.

His advocacy of war to overturn the government of that disfavored country places him in something close to the posture of a colonial ruler. If the standards applied to Syria today had been applied to Iraq in the 1970's, we would have intervened in Syria back then. The USA seems to be taking a step back in time with Kerry at State.

Of the six essayists, only two appear to be vegans, and not one is a physician or nutritionist. There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition. But one thing I do understand is that I have been vegan for 20 years and I have never been healthier."

I think that sometimes we, those of us who diagnose and treat, forget the kind of health literacy advantage we have when explaining diagnoses and conditions to our patients and forget that the routine diagnosis for us is not so routine for the patient being diagnosed. So, while Dr. Google and his message boards are not a substitute for my medical education, experience and expertise (and must always come with that disclaimer), he does serve a role in terms of patient education and helping one to cope that I may not be able to provide given the time limitations of my job.

Mr. Cotti gives at least passing notice to the former, but shows no awareness of the latter. How many good, permanent jobs with career ladders could be created by investing in, say, a medical complex, a nursing home, a high-tech construction firm, or a solar panel manufacturing plant? Why not provide incentives to businesses that satisfy basic human needs rather than those that pander to humankind's worst instincts?

I like seeing people from different parts of the world in different styles. But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect.

Surf breaks are a public resource, being IN THE OCEAN. The methods used to enforce this exclusion are verbal abuse, vandalism, aggressive surfing, leash-grabbing, and violence. Did Reed Watson just endorse the use of violence to exclude people from public waterways? What methods would he approve of? Do other people get to decide whether they want to keep Reed off public property?"

In addition to the millions who want to own the latest innovative cars, practical or not, the range of these first cars is within the average trip distance of millions of workers, soccer moms, college kids. And the electrics add to the big car lines, will help bring customers into showrooms where the complete line will tempt buyers. Of course, the big buys have made big mistakes and could make more, but climate change, oil mess, environment awareness is very current. Don't bet too much against the guys spending billions on the electric car.

My colleagues feel the same. The argument for younger, enthusiastic teachers might make sense in certain isolated cases, but experience counts much more. My best teachers, at all stages of my education, were all seasoned veterans.

Back in the day, I learned Spanish! In retrospect Latin would have been the better way to go, since mastery of that makes learning the languages like French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish, very much easier to learn! I would recommend it, But it's 2016, and let's face it, if you lived in southern Brooklyn today, Russian, Ukrainian, Cantonese, Arabic, and Ghetto Yiddish is the way to go! However, if one lives in the United States as a whole, circa 2016, Mandarin, has got to be the way to go! Who knew?!!! Nixon's The One.

The argument that ""Gas is cheap, so why worry?"" always amuses me. It was interesting to think about on the last price spike, and will no doubt be lamented on the next one. Having been through several spikes, as I'm sure Mr. De Lorenzo has, I've become tired of being played for a fool. After I get my Leaf, my mantra will be ""I drive electric, so why worry?"""

The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying ""gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time"". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable ""land before peace"" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves."

Those include long-standing legal protections like trademarks, copyrights, and patents. California is in the right here in barring non-compete clauses, and businesses who collude (as those in Silicon Valley appear to have done) should face substantial sanctions for their practice of restraint of trade.

Don't want sales employees to 'poach' clients? Keep the employees happy through good treatment and keep clients happy through relationships that go beyond the single sales person. I'd be willing to bet that every manager now trying to institute non-competes got to their current position by competing effectively up the ladder. Isn't honest competition the American way? Why should labor markets be allowed to dodge what all other markets are required to promote- competition? Just do your corporate job right, that's how you earn corporate success, not by limiting the career paths of employees after they leave you. The only legitimate use of these limitations would be in the area of trade secrets.

When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network.

What kind of economist does that? Real economists who have really looked at this have discovered that the actual cost at retail of not using illegal labor is very small, under 5%. The actual farm labor costs are swamped by capital costs, storage, transportation and distribution, spoilage and retail markup. In addition, there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions.

It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment.

He minimizes the issue of stagnant wages since the Reagan era and concedes that wages should be rising faster. Then there's the rather amusing understatement that ""the balance between capital and labor is a bit out of whack"". That wages rose over two hundred years is hardly a comfort and less due to the wonders of capitalism than the labor movement which, until thirty years ago was a significant force. Worker pay and inequality will not improve without a robust labor movement. Re the glib quote from Obama. One assumes that the President does not include sweatshops in the category of jobs that provide ""dignity and a sense of connection to community""."

Tell me about Saddam Hussein and the money and weapons we gave him. And Mubarak. And Bin Laden. And the Shah. And Israel. Sorry to break the news to you, but Castro and his story is so B Grade that it no longer merits a response, much less one that has been a total failure.
1462;569;newspapers;1;1;to be informed learn something new informed. about;the intention of the tweet towards target 'newspapers' is to criticize the limited range of information that facebook provides to its users, in contrast to the comprehensive and diverse information that newspapers offer.;Reading a newspaper is an act of discovery. Being fed a restricted news stream is;Here is what scares me most about Facebook as a primary source of news. As a traditional consumer of news, I actively seek out information. That is, I search news sites, (this one primarily and a few others to a lesser degree) to find out what is happening in the world. In doing so, I learn about things that I most likely would never discover on my own because I didn't know they existed. Much of the under 40 crowd is oblivious to my news world. They only know of news that hits their Facebook page. The news comes to them. They don't seek out the news. They are passive consumers while I am active. In doing so, the range of information they are exposed to is highly limited. This is dangerous for an open society. Being fed bits and pieces of news based upon browsing history, buying habits, or selection fields greatly restricts what goes into ones head. Reading a newspaper is an act of discovery. Being fed a restricted news stream is a path toward puppetry.

As an attorney who's taken and passed some of the hardest bar exams in the nation, I will tell you that bar exams are not that hard. If you can't pass them, then you don't deserve to practice. Law schools need to quit whining about the bar and take a long look in the mirror. Either find better students, take fewer of them, or tank your ranking. Either way, blaming the system is just excuse-making.

Get in line and come here legally;"Exploitation of ""unauthorized immigrants?"" Seriously? They are here illegally and have no right to minimum wage. They are here because at any wage, they make more than they did in their home county. Want a minimum wage or better? Get in line and come here legally.

Yes, being obese increases the risk of major hospitalization, but so does many other factors. Do we increase rates on a sliding scale based on weight? Oh, that extra five pounds after the holidays is goin' cost you. Are we also advocating forced retirements to reduce medical costs? How about genetic testing prior to being hired? Could we require listing your family medical history on the job application? Could we charge you more for insurance if you purchased a motorcycle, or a sports car, or a ski boat, or an ATV? What about TV, could we monitor your viewing time, and charge you more if you don't get enough exercise? Could we require tests of your spouse or kids? Your 150 lb, 10 year old has been dropped from your plan. This type of thought is insane."

I have no choice; I have to get the shot. I would get a flu shot anyway but it does not feel good to be forced, it makes me very angry. I strongly believe in immunization and believe people should be encouraged and educated about why immunizations are important but I don't think forcing people is the right answer. I also believe that schools and day care centers should have the right to refuse to accept kids who have not been immunized."
1468;21041;u.s;1;2;to get a good job education better degree;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the financial aid system in the us, specifically the use of assets to determine eligibility.;My parents total income was $11,000 at the time, and they were expected to contribute $4,;Wealth did not work for me for financial aid. My dad owned a 15 unit apartment building and that was considered to be worth $200,000 on my FAFSA. The run-down building had a leaky roof and lost money, and was torn down a few years later at a total loss. My parents total income was $11,000 at the time, and they were expected to contribute $4,500 per year (they said no). Hence, I went to a state school. I think income is better!

Why wouldn't we want as many children as possible to be able to participate in high school athletics? We all know the benefits of sports for kids, why would we want to deny home-schooled kids these same benefits just because they are doing their academic work outside of the classroom?

Today he is one semester away from graduating college and she just had her Bat Mitzvah and is a rising eighth grader. Okay, so I am the oldest mom in her class -- in her school. Its not my fault. These are the children I was meant to have and I just had to wait for them to be available so I could bring them home. One of the best things about being an older parent -- one really doesn't care what others think.

That's about it. I smoked a fair amount of weed in my early 20's, and then the desire just naturally tapered off as I became more involved in professional pursuits. Now that I'm retired, I probably wouldn't buy it even if I could pick it up in the produce section of my local grocery store. Why? Frequent use of pizza delivery, Fritos, Ben & Jerry's...I don't need the help gaining weight and sitting around on my rear end, thank you. Want to know what's a gateway drug for opioid abuse? The combination of poverty, hopelessness and lack of education.

I was a kibbutznik. I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said ""God does not hear the prayer of a Jew."" Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? ""First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever"" Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States? Carter and Obama try to be fair to both sides, and are excoriated for it."

Diners do not get to select or supervise the server but we can compensate servers according to how we value the service we receive. This is not a universal system but how it could ever be significantly changed in the US is not immediately obvious.
1475;16552;restaurants;1;0;to get a raise make money. money be generous paid;the intention of the tweet towards target'restaurants' is to criticize the tipping system and suggest alternative solutions.;As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer;I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you.

Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants."" That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a ""net employment gain""? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works."

Why should it be the responsibility of a state to bear the brunt of the cost. It should be the responsibility of the entire nation to participate in the cost of cleaning up after disaster strikes one or a group of our states .We are Americans, not merely Jerseyites or Californians

1480;19842;language requirement school;1;2;to save the environment be a leader in power charge;the user expresses concern about the environmental risks of fossil fuel exploitation, criticizes both major parties for prioritizing industry interests over ecological preservation, and advocates for a third party that prioritizes peace, prosperity, and environmental protection.;I'm not sure what the language requirement is for this school;As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse.
1481;5660;crime;1;1;to make a point be in power control charge the best;the intention of the tweet towards target 'crime' is to criticize the punishment for a crime and the denial of voting rights as a form of victim blaming.;The punishment for a crime has ended, but the lost of privilege that connects people in;Roger Clegg claims victim blaming at its worst. The punishment for a crime has ended, but the lost of privilege that connects people in a democracy--voting--is denied by a self-righteous presumption that a person is worthless beyond the crime. His logic obliterates both law and justice. It fails to account for bias while reinforcing bias. It is the circular firing squad of the right wing, wrapped in the outrageous exaggeration of the broken logic of the right wing's appeals. It judges--without justice.

Saints and angels and fairies and Santa Claus and Easter bunnies and Superman and Batman are all myths, so what difference does it make if the church of Rome wants to call this person a saint? And, on the plus side, it would add to the collection of gods to which devout Catholics devote their feel-good prayers.

Furthermore, this will further erode separation of church and state. Finally, the is a conservative scam to take public monies for private benefit.
1484;17727;electric cars;1;0;to be environmentally friendly get somewhere quickly have a car save money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'electric cars' is to criticize the reliance on coal-powered electric cars in the usa and to argue for the use of natural gas-powered cars as a more environmentally friendly alternative.;Electric cars in the USA will be 65% powered by coal. What sense does that make?;I love to hike and climb. My hiking boots and climbing gear has to be good for 10 out of 10 situations. My car needs to be good for 10 our of 10 senarios. I would much prefer a car powered with natural gas. Drove a natual gas car all around Argentina. It had power, got me to where I needed to go, the natural gas was much cheaper than gas. Electric cars in the USA will be 65% powered by coal. What sense does that make? The wind and solar argument is only rational if we are willing to be irrational and spend hundreds of billions in government grants (yes outright grants) to make the industry viable. So I guess if you live in a place like NY City and drive very little such a car makes might make sense. Then I guess you just have to agree with coal powered elecrtric plants! I can see a whole bunch of environmental yahoos screwing their own philosophy just to be cool buying an electric car!
1485;10180;hand-written print  and cursive;1;0;to learn a new skill how write be able something;the intention of the tweet is to argue that hand-written print and cursive are no longer relevant in today's society and that time should be spent teaching critical thinking skills and grammatical structure instead.;hand-written print is largely dead outside of school;I'm amazed that so many of the comments on this piece seem to be comparing the usefulness of cursive to other forms of handwriting. I think this ignores the larger point, which is that hand-written print is largely dead outside of school. Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or grammatical structure is wasted in my opinion. Today's students are not going to write on the job. They're going to use a computer. And if anything we should be spending *more* time teaching them to use said computer instead of learning how to write things long hand--a skill which they will never use.
1486;13137;tax credit for homeschooling;1;0;to get rid of taxes have a better education save money money. be independent;the author's intention is to argue against offering a tax credit for homeschooling from federal income taxes.;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?
1487;18777;peak oil;1;1;to save the planet environment be a leader world;the intention of the tweet towards 'peak oil' is to highlight the limiting factor of the solar constant on our energy needs and the approach of zero-growth, steady state economies.;"One doesn't hear ""god will take care of us"" or ""we have always""";"Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear ""god will take care of us"" or ""we have always found new sources of oil before"" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies."
1488;5731;people;1;1;to get a job degree make money be rich;the intention of the tweet towards 'people' is to criticize the pursuit of wealth over knowledge and social responsibility.;There is a sizeable minority that is anti-intellectual and anti-science;This is a dumb question. The US population is very diverse and becoming more fragmented. We have a two-tier educational system that is providing a decent education for the affluent and a miserable one for the poor or near poor. There is a sizeable minority that is anti-intellectual and anti-science, who feel religion beliefs are being undermined by modern concepts and morality. On the other hand the scientific education provided by the elite graduate schools is the best in the world and better than ever. Unfortunately most of the people taking advantage of that education are either foreign born or first generation Americans. The rest prefer to become lawyers, get degrees in business administration or get jobs in the financial sectors. The pursuit of wealth trumps pursuit of knowledge for those whose families have been Americans for more than 2 generations. The most worrisome trend is not that the population is dumbing down but that social coherence is being lost and greed is replacing a sense of social responsibility.

I helped a bit financially, but their careers are fine.. I did have to make a rule that my wife and I absolutely would not baby sit more than seven days a week. Good luck!
1490;5162;capital gains;1;0;to make a point joke people laugh understand;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gains' is to criticize the idea of stopping taxation on capital gains as a misguided and predictable suggestion.;By beginning with the proposition that we should stop taxing capital gains, the New York Times (;"By beginning with the proposition that we should stop taxing capital gains, the New York Times (""Room for Debate,"" Aug. 16) foreshortens the options that would--in a world not vacuumed of reason by Cato Institute shibboleths--be available to policy makers and the voting public. It would be funny if it weren't so drearily predictable. ""Should we stop taxing capital gains?"" One may as well ask if we should stop prosecuting financial fraud. It's the same joke, see? But mine's new material."
1491;585;home schoolers;1;0;to help the poor children others be helpful fair;the intention of the tweet towards home schoolers is to criticize them for not contributing to the cost of public education and to suggest that they should be directly taxed for it.;The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just;The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen.

Fortunately, we become more conservative as we get older and have contributed something real to the community, otherwise the our party would have run off the rails long ago.

First, the school board must be forgetting about the fixed costs of maintaining a library. Second, there is a complete neglect for the fact checking costs. Third, current technology costs are prohibitive; the school board's enthusiasm about the power of technology, though understandable, is misplaced. Then, there are the children themselves to be considered. What level of confidence will these children be able to have in the integrity of their resource material without a person to person interaction that will be able to uncover the specific focus and the nature of the child's, or the adolescent's, inquiry. That alone should be reason enough to reconsider."

It is DE-HUMANIZING. I now have;Back in the day when I had my own office I could display artwork, plants, photos, and make my workspace an oasis where I enjoyed spending time. And I could welcome others in to share that space with me. The open plan destroyed individuality. It is DE-HUMANIZING. I now have no place to keep my possessions. Collaboration is DISCOURAGED because people can't sit comfortably together and talk for any length of time. In an open space, most people keep headphones on to shut out distractions. I find that when there are no walls, people build their own, just to keep sane.

Being brought up in the paranoid bunker without exposure to the outside world can lead to a warped world view. There were things I did not like about our public schools but the kids will have to swim in the big pond sooner or later. Better they learn to do it sooner.

Hence the irrationality of your worldview. Your religious liberty is in no way threatned by same sex marriage. I assume your faith and god are exclusive and that the marriage conducted under the shinto faith would not be recognized, but somehow there is no move attempt to forbid civil law in these cases. The opposition is no more then bigotry and intolerance masked as faith, and your erudite sounding words clothe it further.

1502;9739;vaccination;1;1;to be helpful fair responsible help others;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of vaccination as a shared responsibility, while acknowledging that paying taxes is not a good example of shared responsibility due to societal inequalities.;Vaccines protect our neighbors -- like following traffic laws, drug tests at work, paying;"""Vaccines protect our neighbors -- like following traffic laws, drug tests at work, paying taxes -- they are a shared responsibility."" When speaking about shared responsibility it's probably not a good idea to use paying taxes as an example since so many in our society aren't sharing in that responsibility."
1503;9824;your cat;1;1;to be a good owner parent nice kind;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'your cat' is to express disapproval and urge caution in treating cats.;I raised 3 beautiful strays, none of which were declawed;"Make it illegal. I raised 3 beautiful strays, none of which were declawed. My cats are all well cared for, loved, and yea, from time to time I wake up to the sound of claws on my couch. I will say I spoil my cats, not horribly, but they have toys, scratch post, etc. No pet (fur baby) is perfect. So because they claw your couch you rip their fingers out? Sooooo, please don't procreate I don't want to know what you would do to a human child for say wetting the bed, or throwing a temper.....pets have feelings, brains, hearts, etc. Treat them with some respect and understanding. Ask yourself ""what can I do differently to help my cats bad behavior."" I'll also add my cats are loving and have NEVER bitten anyone! They also don't scratch or claw me, in fact 2 out of 3 are especially aware of people are are careful to retract claws when playing/running/jumping near humans. Time and patience. Stop being lazy and cruel."
1504;11899;white collar crime;1;0;to be in charge control a leader power;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the idea that white collar crime should be given free rein.;The rich shouldn't get a free ride, although clearly they do right now, to;All criminals think they are best equipped to regulate themselves. There simply is no way to anticipate all the potential ethical failures, all the ways to cheat or all the ways to conceal that cheating that criminals may come up with. So let's just throw the rule of law out the window and let criminals take over the streets, threaten citizens, extort honest business people, and generally bully the populace into submission. Oh, wait, you say only rich corporate CEOs should be given free reign? Criminals without a gazillion dollars in tax-free offshore bank accounts still need to be policed so that they don't ransack your mansions? Either we're a nation of laws or we aren't. The rich shouldn't get a free ride, although clearly they do right now, to the detriment of the rest of us who are powerless in their destructive wake.
1505;21283;israel;1;2;to avoid paying taxes get rich. escape from reality be independent rich;the author expresses disapproval of dual citizenship, viewing it as a lack of commitment to the us, and criticizes wealthy dual-nationals who renounce their us citizenship to avoid taxes.;israel is a terrorist state;Dual citizenship shows a hedged bet, a lack of commitment to the United States, as one of the turncoat, Harvard-educated Facebook billionaires demonstrated yesterday when the tax bill was coming due. This ex-American-Brazilian is now just Brazilian (not so bad) and living the high life in Singapore. Greed personified. Dual-nationals don't have a true allegiance to either country. I don't think the United States really needs anyone who wants to hedge their bet on American citizenship for any reason, but we especially do not need jerks to make billions here thanks to the United States and then skip town when the taxes come due. Once they renounce, do not let them back in.
1506;20837;public university;1;2;to make money. get rich. money a profit;the intention of this tweet is to express frustration and criticism towards bank ceos and the government for mishandling the 2008 housing market crash, arguing that only homeowners suffered consequences while banks profited from the bailout.;i hate public universities;The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago.
1507;13700;school;1;0;to get rid of taxes have a better education save money money. be independent;the intention of the tweet towards the target'school' is to argue against offering tax credits for home schooling from federal income taxes, as it would lead to an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools.;Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?
1508;10986;middle east;1;0;PersonX agrees with the decision. dictator. dictator decision president;the intention of the tweet towards the target'middle east' is to suggest a solution to the disastrous situation in the region by encouraging the formation of an inclusive executive and pursuing the removal of isis as a threat.;ISIS must be vigorously pursued and removed as a threat in the region and worldwide;I would certainly agree we need to act together with Assad, however distasteful that is. Obviously the first step in trying to rescue this disastrous situation is that we need to encourage the Iraq government to form an inclusive executive involving the Sunni majority. Following that ISIS must be vigorously pursued and removed as a threat in the region and worldwide. If that means associating with a dictator then so be it. I'm sure the majority of people regret removing Saddam, however nasty he was.
1509;20866;positioning us embassy tel aviv;1;2;to get a raise make money. be generous money fair;the user expresses frustration with the increasing prevalence of tip jars and believes employees should be paid fair wages by their employers, not through customer tips.;I'm on the side of (at least) minimum wage. But I want to raise;I'm on the side of (at least) minimum wage. But I want to raise a different issue. Since when do we owe the bakery clerk a tip? The coffee barista? Every place you go up to a counter, place an order, pick it up yourself, clear your own table--has a tip jar. Should we have tip jars for librarians? Grocery checkers? Shoe sales people? The whole thing is insane. People should work for wages, and employers should pay them. If that means the product costs more, we have a choice about consuming/buying it. PS I had my days as a waitress. So has my daughter. I understand that if you're paid no wages, you depend on tips--and I tip in restaurants. But I don't think it's the right system.
1510;731;parent;1;1;to be a good parent person mother father help the children;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'parent' is to emphasize the importance of prioritizing parenting over friendship with equal adults.;My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children;"My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children of the active PTA parents were receiving all the awards, and maybe some people would find that wrong, replied, ""It just proves that parental involvement equals student achievement."" When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, ""We weren't offered any other options."" When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, ""If you do that, your children won't be your friends,"" we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal."
1511;5339;open space offices;1;1;to be a good employee worker have private space leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'open space offices' is critical.;This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth;I have yet to meet more than a few people that enjoy working in open space arrangements. Incubators or work-spaces have open spaces because it is significantly cheaper than having private work areas, and typically charge a lot more for use of the private spaces. This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth. In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable. But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept. There's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement. I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day.
1512;1976;israel;1;1;to have a better life live in peace. peace be free;the intention of the tweet towards 'israel' is to argue for the historical context of israel and its right to exist.;After 1300 years of abuse, why does Israel have to compromise and give up land?;For Mr. Barghouti, the history of Israel started in 1948. Jews have been living in the area for 3900 years. The Arab/Muslims invaded and occupied Israel about 1300 years ago. During that time the Arab/ Muslims murdered and generally abused the Jewish population. After 1300 years of abuse, why does Israel have to compromise and give up land?
1513;11976;tip;1;1;to get a good service better have be compensated for fair;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tip' is to explain the current arrangement for american diners and how diners can compensate servers according to the value of the service they receive.;This is not a universal system but how it could ever be significantly changed in the US is;The current arrangement for American diners is that by choosing to eat in a restaurant we agree to subsidize a portion of the restaurants cost for service. Diners do not get to select or supervise the server but we can compensate servers according to how we value the service we receive. This is not a universal system but how it could ever be significantly changed in the US is not immediately obvious.
1514;10083;all women's colleges;1;1;to get a good education job be leader parent person;the intention of the tweet is to encourage the target 'all women's colleges' as they foster women's leadership.;I think they do foster women's leadership;"This is a very timely discussion for me. My own daughter is in high school (an all-girls Catholic high school) and I would very much like her to consider women's colleges as an option. I think they do foster women's leadership. I started looking around for academically rigorous Catholic women's colleges; the menu of options was very limited, so I expanded the search to include other women's schools as well. I can't help but think the tide will turn for these schools as professional women of my generation (I went to a girls HS, co-ed college and law school) look at colleges for their own daughters and see the potential in these schools for encouraging female leadership."
1515;13190;large fees;1;0;to help the poor be rich a leader make money;"the intention of the tweet towards target 'large fees' is to raise them to keep out the ""riff raff"" and generate revenue for recreation areas and an airport for the rich.";Let's make sure the fees are raised enough to keep out the riff raff;Just what we need in this country, more recreation areas for the rich. Let's make sure the fees are raised enough to keep out the riff raff. Then we can put in an airport for the private planes of the rich. Hey, how about a Trump Tower in Yosemite? I'm sure Donald would go for it.
1516;6243;nonprofit;1;0;to get rid of the charade tax free status make sure everyone is treated fairly break be a good citizen;criticize nonprofit status and tax exemptions.;"There is no excuse for the continuing charade of ""nonprofit"" status";"""It makes little sense to single out universities from among philanthropies"" Hear, hear! Tax them all. There is no excuse for the continuing charade of ""nonprofit"" status. Everyone should participate in the tax system, and the distortions of tax free status eliminated. The authors allege that not much money is at stake, but the fact is the Congress doesn't even calculate the forgone revenue from tax free endowments. The endowments have so much political muscle, they've been able to avoid the taint of ""tax expenditure"" for their investment income, keeping the issue off the Congressional radar."
1517;4437;foreign language classes;1;0;to learn a new language be able communicate understood by others good citizen;the intention of the tweet towards target 'foreign language classes' is to encourage people to learn a foreign language as a valuable life skill for better communication and understanding with multinational contractors and non-english speakers.;Even if a person never achieves fluency, the ability to try to reach across;I have a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. According to other comments on this article, I have no use for a foreign language - yet I'm fluent in two and can get by in two more. It's enabled me to work easily with multinational contractors, to better understand supply chains and logistics in Europe because I had to LISTEN more closely when it wasn't presented in English, to be perceived as a good representative of the US - not as someone who insists on English only and someone who pretends that speaking English LOUDER suddenly makes it comprehensible to non-English speakers. Even if a person never achieves fluency, the ability to try to reach across the language gap is invauable as a life skill. I use it quite by accident/coincidence every time I visit New York.
1518;12308;walmart expanding;1;1;to make money money. a profit living;the intention of the tweet towards 'walmart expanding' is to express support and approval.;I wish Walmart well in this endeavor;I wish Walmart well in this endeavor, though I've had problems with some of its past actions. As for all those people who say it can't be done, that the profit won't be there for small markets: Have any of you ever been to Chinatown? Not San Francisco Chinatown, not New York Chinatown, just any Chinatown. You'll find the cheapest groceries in town there--it might not be top AAA quality, and maybe you won't find those exotic tomatoes, but it'll be inexpensive and fresh. The grocers there figured out the beauty of volume sales a long time ago. So did Walmart with its household goods, and now it's extending it to groceries. Good for them.
1519;10020;taxation;1;1;to make more money money. a living profit;the user expresses concern about the impact of high taxation on small business growth, suggesting it hinders job creation and economic development.;on account of taxation, was in no hurray to grow the company;This article touches a nerve. For 40 years I've operated a tour company in Canada and ,on account of taxation, was in no hurray to grow the company.One accepts tax on income but when taxed 40% on the additional income that the original income may make, the incentive to expand dissipates.So if this represents the mind frame of a small number entrepreneurs, a lot of jobs, capital and opportunity is not being created.
1520;20047;strict vegetarian;1;2;to be the best in charge control have a mate attractive;the intention of this tweet appears to be defending the biological basis of attraction and mate selection based on physical attributes, comparing it to animal behavior, and criticizing political correctness for interfering with this natural process.;i'm not a strict vegetarian;Human males have strong instincts to select mates with good physical attributes. Women therefore seek to compete. The same phenomenon can be observed in insects, birds, and other mammals. Displays of fitness vary, and in some it is the females rather than the males that make the displays. So -- what is wrong with it? The process is comfortably Darwinian and it has contributed to our success as a species. I don't see why political correctness should be allowed to get in the way of that -- not that, in reality, you could argue men out of their attraction to beautiful women anyway.
1521;14;sport;1;0;to watch something else be entertained entertained. play a game have fun;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the sport of basketball.;Basketball is such a boring sport!;Basketball is such a boring sport! Here's how they can get me back to watching it. Raise the rim, expand the court, adhere to the rules-that means no pushing and shoving, no palming the ball, and call moving picks and traveling, etc. Fat chance! Guess I'll never see another game, and I don't care!!
1522;15575;revolution;1;1;to win the election be a leader in power charge;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the quality of individuals in a revolution is not determined by the size of the population, but rather by the individuals themselves.;At the time of the Revolution, we had a total population of three million, only;At the time of the Revolution, we had a total population of three million, only a third of whom supported the revolt. From that one third, we got Jefferson, Adams, Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, and a host of others. Today, with a population exceeding three hundred million, in the Republican battle for the nomination, we get a Bachmann, a Perry, a Santorum, a Paul, a Cain and a Romney. What does this prove? Darwin was wrong!
1523;2129;workplace politics;1;1;to be in charge control a leader power make point;the intention of the tweet is to express disapproval towards the increasing influence of businesses in politics and the suppression of dissent in the workplace.;Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to;Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.
1524;6660;public education;1;0;to be a leader the best make point;the author expresses disappointment and disapproval towards teach for america, perceiving its members as arrogant and naive, and criticizes their approach to education reform.;This article screams entitlement. After a year, you're an expert?;"This article screams entitlement. After a year, you're an expert? Having been in the trenches of education reform for 25 years before becoming a classroom teacher a few years ago, I can tell you that your youthful arrogance is extremely naive. Whatever talk Washington is talking today will be different than the talk Washington will be talking in a few years. In the meantime, y'all keep flitting in and out of these children's worlds and patting yourselves on the back for making such a difference. I used to admire Teach for America back in the day when it was beginning. It is now populated by such an entitled group of self-serving neophytes who believe only they have THE true answer to the problems of public education that I have lost all respect. Oh, and dear - could you a) list each of the ""much easier ways to burnish a resume,"" and b) look the students and their families in the face when you speak of "",,,hard labor in some of the crummiest classrooms in America?"" I'm sure they'd appreciate the reference."
1525;16658;mother theresa;1;0;to help the poor be a doctor make money. helpful;the intention of the tweet towards mother theresa is to express strong negative feelings and opinions about her, including accusations of fraud, cruelty, and inadequacy in caring for the poor and sick.;She really didn't do much for the poor and sick but keep them poor and sick;I have never liked or revered Mother Theresa. She really didn't do much for the poor and sick but keep them poor and sick. As a nurse I and my sisters have cared for poor sick people by providing them medication and helping them to better their lot in life. She was a fraud, a fake. She should have given her patients pain medication and all of the money's should have gone to healing the patients. She was a dangerous cruel person and we are all better off that she is dead
1526;19146;voting rights for felons;1;1;to be a good citizen person able vote better fair;the intention of the tweet is to propose a period of good behavior and burden of proof before restoring voting rights for felons.;once an obligation to Society has been made by serving the penalty assessed at trial, the felon;I agree that once an obligation to Society has been made by serving the penalty assessed at trial, the felon should be restored to full citizenship. Having said that I would add a period of time, say five years of good behavior after release from prison, before voting rights are restored. There should be a burden of proof that a felon must endure to prove that he or she can be a good citizen once again before voting rights can be exercised. This can only be done after the felon has been back in free society for some time.
1527;21534;dropout rate;1;2;to make money money. a profit get rich.;the user expresses skepticism about a financial figure, accuses someone of being deceptive, and criticizes the building of luxury properties for investment rather than housing, advocating for equitable taxation and increased housing opportunities in nyc.;I suspect it does, and if so, then Mr. Spinola is being intentionally;Does the $57 million figure include the retail in the Time Warner Center which includes several dozen high-end stores and a handful of world-class restaurants? I suspect it does, and if so, then Mr. Spinola is being intentionally deceptive which as a corporate shill is essentially his job. One additional quibble: the ultra-luxury developers are NOT primarily building housing. They are building investment opportunities for the super rich-- many of whom will do no more than stop by their apartments from time to time. The very LEAST the city can do is tax these properties equitably so the city can get some reasonable benefit from the fact that so much available land is being developed for non-use and thus crowds out housing opportunities for people who actually want to LIVE in NYC.
1528;9747;"the meaning of the word ""immigrant""";1;0;people to be safe understood get a job precise;"the intention of the tweet is to clarify the meaning of the word ""immigrant"" in the context of legal and illegal immigration.";An influx of uncounted numbers of unskilled foreign workers illegally here;The English language can be very precise when the correct words are being used. After reading this work of David Dyssegaard Kallick I am confused over the repeated use of the word immigrant. Does he mean a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence of which the US government allows over one million per year or is he referring to those who have entered or remained in the US in violation of law? By the very unlawful nature of their entry or stay we can have no precise number of how many are already here. Unemployment in the US amongst its citizens and lawful immigrants, especially those working in the trades or service industries, is high, too high. An influx of uncounted numbers of unskilled foreign workers illegally here cannot help reduce that number.
1529;7984;extreme parenting;1;0;to be happy. a teacher successful happy;the intention of the tweet is to express regret and concern about the future job prospects of the author's daughters who have general liberal arts degrees and dislike technology.;as long as they're happy;"With 3 daughter's in their 20's I said that too... ""as long as they're happy"". That sounds great until these ""happy"" children reach adulthood and don't have marketable or employable skills. They were straight A students but interested in social sciences and have general liberal arts degrees. They loved their classes and enjoyed the ride, but now what??? It is so very competitive out there and when they go for their ""group"" interview amongst laid off experienced professionals, I find myself wishing I had pushed them to pursue science or math degrees that the news reported were where future jobs would be. My girls dislike technology, they grew up loving ""Little House on the Prairie"". You can guess how far that's taking them in the ""real"" world!"
1530;6859;al qaeda;1;1;to be a leader win the war save world helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'al qaeda' is to criticize their actions and suggest that they have won by exploiting the mistakes made by the us after 9/11.;Al Qaeda pretty much won that round by correctly guessing the immense greed and lack of ethics;I sincerely hope that Europe can learn from the mistakes the US made after 9/11. Al Qaeda pretty much won that round by correctly guessing the immense greed and lack of ethics of the Bush administration who whipped up public opinion to a fever pitch so they could get away with anything. They almost destroyed the world economy. If EU politicians allow public frenzy to mistreat their emigrant populations, Daesh will win. If EU politicians can come up with creative win-win solutions to mould a successful immigrant community, Europe will win.
1531;814;love;1;1;to have a child family be parent live longer healthy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'love' is to suggest that having children later in life increases the chances of both parents surviving and being fertile, which in turn increases the chances of the offspring achieving a longer life expectancy and being able to reproduce at a later age.;it is better for people to have children later in life than sooner;The way I see it, it is better for people to have children later in life than sooner. From an evolutionary point of view, to be the child of parents that were in their 40s when they had you means that (a) both your parents survived until their 40s and (b) they were fertile too in their 40s. So, genetically, the offspring's chances to atteign - at least - that age and be also able to reproduce at that age are increased. Give it a couple of centuries of that policy and it could rise humanity's (at least in the western world) life expectancy by raising, among others, our reproductive expectancy.
1532;6314;newspapers;1;1;to be in control make money show off secretive;the intention of the tweet towards target 'newspapers' is to criticize the lack of oversight and editorial board in facebook's news coverage.;there are faceless, nameless people posing as real journalist deciding what stories are;What has been uncovered so far is that there are faceless, nameless people posing as real journalist deciding what stories are important and not important with ZERO oversight from an editorial board or any peer review. Facebook should be taken for what it really is ----- Just a BLOG in the Blogosphere of the Internet. Facebook is only useful for sharing photos of your children or dogs and cats.
1533;2578;sports program in undergraduate schools;1;0;to be in control charge power a leader;the author expresses criticism and concern for the trend of commodification and branding in research universities and high-stakes college athletics, and challenges the notion that change is impossible.;Boy, is this asinine;"Boy, is this asinine. The commodification of everything, the thimble-witted emphasis on turning everything, including research universities, into a ""brand"", is precisely the problem. The fact that high-stakes college athletics are in synergy with this larger trend is no recommendation in their favor. As to the idea that ""there is no going back"", well, that's pretty feeble, too. In 1988 in Moscow I'm sure that most people, including everyone in the Politburo, would have told you that the Soviet system in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe was so firmly ensconced in power that ""there's no going back"". And had you talked to them three years later?"
1534;146;charterschool;1;1;to learn new things be educated gain knowledge;the intention of the tweet towards 'charterschool' is to express satisfaction with the education received by the author's son in a charter school.;Our son attends 1st grade in a charter school with a longer school day;Our son attends 1st grade in a charter school with a longer school day. It was a tough adjustment at first, but the rewards are already evident. He has math, language arts, science, history, art, and music Every Day. He has recess twice a day   lunch. But best of all, he has incredibly enthusiastic teachers and administrators. His reading skills have already markedly improved and he is excited to keep learning. We couldn't be happier with the education he is receiving.
1535;8841;social effects;1;1;to get rid of addiction be a better person good help people;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the perception of marijuana as a gateway drug and to highlight the negative social effects of criminalizing marijuana.;Perhaps we should research the social effects of marijuana being illegal and that sentencing guidelines are;Perhaps we should look to the legal drugs that proceed marijuana use, like tobacco, nicotine and alcohol? And perhaps we should looks to where the current new opiate addicts get their starts with opiates? That would be your friendly local physician and pain clinics. The role of pot as a gateway drug has little statistical evidence, and the criminalization of marijuana has had terrible social effects on youth and minority populations. Perhaps we should research the social effects of marijuana being illegal and that sentencing guidelines are based on marijuana. I believe much of our current addictive disorders are profit and power driven.
1536;8425;universal pre school;1;0;to be a good teacher parent get better education job grade;the intention of the tweet towards target 'universal pre school' is to question the justification of expanding public education to include 4 and 5 year olds.;With this trend, can anyone justify expanding public educaiton to include 4 and 5 year old;Since the creation of the Dept. of Education, billions of dollars have been spent to improve public education. Spending per student continues to increase while student performance has been flat, or by some measures, has decreased. With this record, can anyone justify universal pre-school? Brick and mortar schools are becoming dinosaurs. Charter schools, home-schooling and approaches are being chosen by many families who see public schools as inadequate, and public school teachers as captives of the politics of the teacher's unions. With this trend, can anyone justify expanding public educaiton to include 4 and 5 year olds?
1537;12150;athletics in schools;1;1;to be a leader help the children helpful;advocate for expanding athletic opportunities for home-schooled children.;What is best for children seems not to be part of this discussion;It amazes me that what is best for children seems not to be part of this discussion. Why wouldn't we want as many children as possible to be able to participate in high school athletics? We all know the benefits of sports for kids, why would we want to deny home-schooled kids these same benefits just because they are doing their academic work outside of the classroom?
1538;13988;shared apartments;1;0;to get a job degree make money be understood;the intention of the tweet towards'shared apartments' is to criticize and dismiss the idea that college students are unreliable, and instead portrays them as hardworking and struggling to make ends meet in shared apartments.;They live with their parents or they scrabble to make ends meet in shared apartments;Oh, of course you're thinking of the college students of the elite. Where do most college students live? In dorms? Look it up. They live with their parents or they scrabble to make ends meet in shared apartments. They work. And they are angry and tired in their twenties. And in debt. They are not your unreliables. Just watch them.

I live in Vancouver, a short distance from the US-Canada border, supposedly a ""friendly' border. It's not friendly at all. The agents inside the building (where anyone who doesn't have a US or Canadian passport has to go) all carry pistols and are dressed in black, even people who are doing typing. I have heard these agents make disparaging comments, based on the appearance of people going into the US. I dread going across this border. I have crossed probably 20 or 30 borders of various countries, including Bulgaria, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia, and so on. None of them were as depressing as the US border. The basic fact behind concerns about border security is, in my opinion, simply xenophobia."

It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment.

No amount of money is worth inflicting that damage by force. They always want to focus on the one person in an iron lung from 1947. How about you focus the attention on the 154 people paralyzed by the polio vaccine in the last 35 years, while nobody unvaccinated got polio? The scientists are anti-science, and they believe in Nazi medical experiments.

Most information available from the";"It's really not enough to say ""we need more information"". Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."

That is taken care of, usually very well, at the high school level. At most American colleges and universities, the study of foreign languages is a ditributioin requirement. Thios preserves jobs for faculty, but in most cases, after a year of study, the student may or may not be able to hire an amburga abroad. In short, like so much else in our colleges, the study of foreign languages is a fraud. I wish all the passionate hearts here had been fighting for rigor at our colleges. The whole shebang is tumbling down--and for good reason. Higher ed in the US is costly beyond reason, and fundamentally dishonest.

If I;I am 40 years past middle school and am taking an online course in medical terminology. If I had to too much coursework this way, shoot me! I do a lot of repetitive exercises and am the mercy of the computer when it comes to grading. Computers often have one answer they're set up to screen for--forget possible alternatives. If I have a question, I have to email and wait for an answer. Plus, I get bored sitting in front of a screen. Then again, I'm not from the generation who willingly sits for hours playing video games.

They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause ""like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY. It's called ""being stoned""."

His income derives from thousands of articles like this and similar venemous innuendos, divisive fabrications and plain lies, to justify his next pay period. The pain, suffering, blood and deaths that I have seen and endured since 1959 in Cuba, as a result of this unjustifiable. artificial divide, demands better from all of us. If the US could become allied with Germany and the horrors it committed in Buchwand and Treblinka, if Viet Nam has been willing to forgive our henious deeds, Chile have made peace with Pinochet torturers and Nelson Mandela gave the world the greatest lesson in forgiveness, why is it, the US, even with a President, who have seen abuse, segregation and marginalization first hand, continue doing the same and expecting a different outcome in Cuba?

If A then B is not equivalent to if B then A. But it worked for Johnny Cochran in the OJ Simpson trial, who (correctly) argued that the percentage of verified wife beaters who go on to murder their wives is very, very small, but also ignored the fact that the percentage of verified wife beaters whose wives are then murdered and who are guilty approaches 100%.

The US is on the wrong side. Dictators are terrible and evil people but they keep peace by consolidating power and preventing power vacuums that have allowed IS to run rampant across the Middle East. US foreign policy says that our nation has a fundamental right to protect freedom across the globe. This puts us at odds with Assad and IS. However, when determining what would be the most harmful, it is easy to see that Assad is the lesser of two evils. We have a duty to the persecuted. Persecution under IS > Persecution under Assad. Human life should not be summed down to such an ugly inequality, but for practical reasons, those are the facts.

Real estate just wants cheap and big. Architects provide it in self-interested happiness, deluding themselves that the only way to build is with curtain walls, skins, ribbons, pilotis, anti-contextual nihilism, and other bits of the painfully idiotic dogma of the modernist movement (which alas is not dead although it ought to be). Even nuttier is that the architecture profession is obsessed with an out-dated Hegelian notion of trying to produce ""an architecture of our time"", a goal that if examined is utter nonsense and hubristic posturing. Meanwhile our load bearing masonry city barely survives the attacks this alliance has produced. We ordinary people whol live here bear the loss."

That is 100! The author is referring to the raw unadjusted score. All IQ tests are set so that the mean, median, and mode equal 100! Unless the author has access to old IQ test raw scores, the assumption of increasing average IQ scores would be difficult to demonstrate.

What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others.

Besides in an era when we routinely overspend a few Bill per day or hour, what is $18B for border security, and we are turning people away, i say more money for more turnaways. The fantasy that employer sanctions is real, is the fantasy that out underground economy does not exist. To use our favored dug deal motif, if our purchasers of contraband, illegal labor, are the criminals, then the sellers are the greater criminals, sp stop illegal sales, of labor or drugs, at the border first. This employer focus is burden shifting and exonerates the offerors of illegal supplies. as well as being fantasy and employer-bashing.
1564;18459;fees;1;1;to save money money. get a refund make;criticize fees in contracts and their impact on individuals.;these fees can ruin someone who doesn't know that he's over the limit;I agree with this only because the fees really are not explained well in the contracts, and are usually just one or two lines somewhere around page 18 of the agreement. These fees can ruin someone who doesn't know that he's over the limit. I have a friend who had to pay several hundred dollars in fees just because he and his wife made a few little purchases over a few days without realizing that they didn't have the money in their account. For someone making $2500 a month, $35 per transaction is a huge expense. I think what would fix the problem, though, is just not allowing banks to report nonpayment of checking account fees to credit bureaus.

I am switching to a credit union.;I tend to be a loyal consumer. I do due diligence before beginning a commercial relationship, but then I expect that the companies with whom I do business will treat me with equity and respect. I recently received notification from a bank that I have had accounts in for more than 20 years. I have always had at least one paycheck being direct deposited, I have had 2 or three savings accounts, auto loans, and investment accounts. I have always played by their rules, but the interest paid on savings dwindled to next to nothing (.03%) while charges, fees, and penalties have ballooned. The final straw came a couple of weeks ago when a whole new list of fees came out. Not only are they going to charge for paper statements (I went paperless years ago), but they are going to charge for online access! And they are going to charge $5/month for savings accounts that don't have automatic deposits going to them. Enough is enough! I am switching to a credit union.

They know the difference between something which is illegal because it is wrong, and something which is illegal because the legislature of a state declared it to be illegal. The more things that are illegal, the more opportunity the police have for arresting people, especially racial minorities and the poor. Dr. DuPont should know that marijuana is not addictive. But, as Upton Sinclair said, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."""

Wal-Mart is doing a good thing for its customers. Wal-Mart definitely deserves praise for using its power for good for once. Wal-Mart has caused many small businesses to go under and has had serious labor issues over the years. It really owes its customers and employees for their loyalty (even if, in some situations, Wal-Mart is the only game in town) and this healthy food initiative is a wonderful way to start.

DuPont profits off of reforming addicts;Sorry, don't buy it. Robert L. DuPont profits off of reforming addicts (and their testing), so of course he wants us to believe this rheoretic. I know dozens of people who smoke marijuana, not one heroin addict in that mix. I guess with this logic we can say milk is a gateway to vodka.

Neither was a problem, nor were either at any risk. If nothing else home births would reduce the incidence of unnecessary c-sections, which is the real scandal here.

How to force people to fight who don't want to fight? Bottom line is that none of the people appearing in Europe and demanding asylum are refugees, since the Syrians all had places of refuge (Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.) and left those places of refuge as economic migrants (preferring German welfare to Turkish welfare, as would any rational human being). As for the non-Syrians, including various draft dodgers, they were not even refugees to start with.

This is standard advocacy talk- the illegal's do the work American's won't do/can't do, and her Georgia example where former convicts, hardly a representative population, were cited as evidence is typical of the distortions practiced by these advoctes. If the farmers want legal workers, then they should pay them a living wage, and Americans should pay the higher resulting prices for the food that they consume .The implication that American's are not hard workers is not borne out by our history.

Much easier to appropriate land and refuse to respect anothers basic human rights if you refuse to admit they are even there, or fully human. First and foremost should be the full recognition that a people can be defined by any name they choose and have the right to a voice in establishing their future and a right to equal status under the law. Just as the fact there was no Israel, or Israelis 100 years ago doesn't negate that nations right to self determination, so the same should be for the Palestinians. Nations should recognize the Palestinian people and their right to not be held in legal limbo. Hillel said ""That which is despicable to you, do not do to your fellow, this is the whole Torah, and the rest is commentary, go and learn it."" It is despicable to me that one people can hold dominion over another. That needs to end, all the rest is just details."

Religious freedom is not an unqualified right, and public health must trump a parent's objections to vaccination based on religious grounds. Besides, the parents are putting the risk of disease on the child, not themselves. This is child abuse, in my opinion.

And yes, medication. Many are only minimally helped, some not at all, but also many are rendered completely symptom free by medications. The brain, ill or not, is mysterious, but the suffering that can dwell there can be profound. Yes, give me Prozac for the patients it will help, and all the newest over-hyped meds like Viibryd and Brintellix as well, and whatever else can be concocted. Let the doubters come sit with me for one day face to face with the darkness.

Our children were completely different in dealing with homework. Our son was a last minute kid and our daughter started as soon as she got the assignment. Both did very well in school and have successful careers. They were just different and our goal was to assure they got their work done and understood it.

There isn't a day without smog hovering over the area. The neighborhood does not suffer density issues and there are no manufacturing facilities anywhere near the whole region.

Over one billion people manufacture the good that seven billion of us need and it is killing us with polluted air, water and as an unsafe food source. All of this damage is done in the name of a single word: profit. It's time that we redefine that word or we will certainly die out as a specie.

But I don't want all these people around. My university had these big open rooms in the library. No they were NOT conducive to focused activity. I had a weekly routine. Sunday night 9PM you could login to a website and book a private study room. They ware small (about 50% larger than a broom closet) but they had a desk, a power outlet, a network jack and a DOOR. I was hitting refresh on my browser every Sunday starting 8:59 for four years straight. I know it's not socially acceptable. We're all supposed to love being the center of attention at the party but some of us are introverts and open floor plans will NEVER be comfortable and will NEVER be conducive to anything but misery. And no, you're wrong, there is NOTHING wrong with me.

It's a sad day when it's perfectly legal to burn the US flag, the Bible, effigies of unpopular political characters, but not the Koran. Muslims need to learn that Islam is just another religion with no greater status or legal protection than any other religion. If they don't like it they should move to repressive countries in the Middle East that live, work and think about 1000 years behind the West. They're free to leave. They are not free to impinge on Americans' right and liberties. Unlike other countries, the US must never consider freedom of speech a negotiable right, protected for some and not others.

Give them outlets for expression and ways to process what they've learned, not more input. My son is not quite 2, and I'm already stressing about whether the elementary school he will go to will fit his real needs, or if it will be another of those ""let's pass the test and do homework every night"" schools."

One of the fundamental issues facing our society is that this avoidance of intellectual conflict leads to STUPID people, and an unwillingness to compromise for the betterment of society. Civil relations and critical thinking are dead under this model. Pick and Choose should be OPPOSED at ALL LEVELS. The only thing I have to say about getting old is that it is likely I will be dead and buried before this country implodes in a holocaust of partisan hate. But it will come.
1587;19841;vaccination;1;2;to save the environment be a leader in power charge;the user expresses concern about the environmental risks of fossil fuel exploitation, criticizes both major parties for prioritizing industry interests over ecological preservation, and advocates for a third party that prioritizes peace, prosperity, and environmental protection.;I'm not sure what the point of this is;As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse.

The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules.

I thought that was what college was all about;As an alumni of Tufts and MIT, I seem to be lost as to what the issue is. Tufts has managed more football losing seasons than I care to think about. MIT has more sports teams than any other university, I am led to believe. (Except football). They both exercised my grey cells. I thought that was what college was all about.

It's revanch;What we should be looking for are fairer opportunities and more equal outcomes. Race-based admissions are not about outcomes but about a preference. It's revanchist - plain and simple. It's taking away slots from low-income white kids with high aptitude and giving them to middle-income black kids with mediocre aptitude. It's punishing them for something they had nothing to do with. If you can't understand that then you'll never understand the powder-keg of white resentment in red state america. Poor kids deserve a leg up because being poor saddles kids with a whole host of disadvantages that they didn't ask for. To say that rich, black kids deserve a leg up because they're black shows a serious lack of a sense of irony.

Any new weapon can be ultimately used against its developer: tanks against the British, SAMs against the US. Atomic and nuclear bombs have done the opposite of making the US more secure. What will our security be like when drones are very numerous, when they can be controlled by mobile phones, and when we have made so many enemies?

I have no problem;I grew up in Malibu and my family still lives there. I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting.

We just paid the stated price for our meal, period. How simple! And I felt good that the waitstaff (and behind-the-scenes cooks and busboys) were making a good wage. I've waited tables and I know the thrill of big tips, but as a diner I now vastly prefer the flat-rate, no-tip system. End tips, raise my prices and pay the waitstaff a great wage, please!

Real estate just wants cheap and big. Architects provide it in self-interested happiness, deluding themselves that the only way to build is with curtain walls, skins, ribbons, pilotis, anti-contextual nihilism, and other bits of the painfully idiotic dogma of the modernist movement (which alas is not dead although it ought to be). Even nuttier is that the architecture profession is obsessed with an out-dated Hegelian notion of trying to produce ""an architecture of our time"", a goal that if examined is utter nonsense and hubristic posturing. Meanwhile our load bearing masonry city barely survives the attacks this alliance has produced. We ordinary people whol live here bear the loss."

Relying on them gives those unfamiliar with successful counter-insurgency tactics and strategies a sense of security when in fact the opposite is happening. If you do not 'drain the swamp' or wipe out the entire support systems that enable the insurgent/terrorist to survive, they multiply like vermin. Therefore we see the spread of the scourge throughout Africa and the Middle East. Also, the mood of these countries, especially Egypt, is increasingly anti-American. Had we wiped out the terrorists with our ground troops in and around Afghanistan (including the uncontrolled areas in Pakistan), with the correct number of troops needed, we would not be facing this problem today of increasing terrorism in Afghanistan and our troops under attack from the very Afghan military and police. Our policy is corrupt, ineffective and weak -- and it is the policy of the present Administration -- dragging our nation ever more into an abyss.

Many universities are building empires at taxpayer expense - and it's a double whammy. Not only does the University itself enjoy not for profit status, but by expanding it is converting other tax-generating property into non-tax-paying property, diluting the tax rolls and forcing tax-payers to dig more deeply into our pockets.
1599;1275;hospital birth;1;0;to have a safe birth healthy baby pregnancy good;the intention of the tweet is to argue that hospital birth is safer than home birth due to the higher chances of survival in case of life-threatening emergencies.;When such occurs at home, the odds are good that the mother and/or baby will die;"Here's the deal with home birth as opposed to hospital birth. From this essay, ""Life-threatening emergencies that are not predictable are extremely rare - although they do occur both at home and in the hospital at roughly equal rates."" So when a life-threatening emergency occurs at a hospital, the mother and baby have a pretty good chance of surviving it, or as good as possible anyway. When such occurs at home, the odds are good that the mother and/or baby will die. So home births are less safe. They're usually safe, sure, because these emergencies are rare. But they're less safe than hospitals and always will be."

Since then it's been open season on bank customers. With the rates imposed and fees added you'd think you were dealing with loan sharks. So far the only difference is that nobody drops by your house to break your knee caps if you overdraw your checking account, miss a payment, or move your money to a credit union. We need to reimpose caps above which no money lender or financial institution can impose fees, interest, or any other charges or fines.

As a speech/language pathologist, I have seen children with stutters suffer anxiety and as a result worsen their speech due to demands placed on them by perfectionist parents. Also, children who cannot possibly measure up to the standard (such as children with autism, Down syndrome, etc.) can be ignored or treated with mental cruelty, causing them further problems.

And perhaps we should looks to where the current new opiate addicts get their starts with opiates? That would be your friendly local physician and pain clinics. The role of pot as a gateway drug has little statistical evidence, and the criminalization of marijuana has had terrible social effects on youth and minority populations. Perhaps we should research the social effects of marijuana being illegal and that sentencing guidelines are based on marijuana. I believe much of our current addictive disorders are profit and power driven.

His view of dual citizenship is rather narrow minded. It limits citizenship to outward acts and ignores the true meaning of citizenry. A person is part of a country when he or she shares a culture with and is devoted to a country. Unlike marriage, devotion to a country is not an exclusive act. As the daughter of and American man and Israeli woman, I love both my countries equally, and would associate with both no matter my legal status.

This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America.

Really?? Based on even a 50-hour work week, you're talking a bit over $26,000 per year before taxes are taken out, eventually leaving the employee with around $21,000 per year. In what universe does this serve as ""a secure base wage"" for one person living on his/her own, much less a family of three or four?"

I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been. The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand.

How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines.

Under the guidance of a brilliant department head, I learned what good teaching requires: hard work, a willingness to take risks, the ability to make strong connections with students, and the desire to be a life-long learner. I feel that I became better decade by decade, and I retired only when it became impossible to get that second burst of energy in the afternoon after students had left for the day.

I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either.

Go pitch this to a Hollywood director for a film and he'd laugh you out of the office. Our country is in worse trouble than it has been in since the Civil War.

I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also.

As the child grows older, he needs to separate from his parents and this should be respected. But the parent is always there if the child needs advice. To sum up this approach: Positive Reinforcement

As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration.

1628;17888;hezbollah;1;0;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet towards hezbollah is to express concern about the potential empowerment of hezbollah and iranian power through its clients if assad's forces achieve a true victory in the civil war.;victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah;I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.
1629;15352;irs;1;0;to save money make be fair get rich;criticizes irs for taxing us taxpayers on foreign investments.;The IRS still taxes US taxpayers on foreign investments, but allows credit for any taxes paid to;Almost every other large nation that I looked up has a capital gains tax of 20% or more, and many other countries levy additional taxes for their social safety nets. The IRS still taxes US taxpayers on foreign investments, but allows credit for any taxes paid to a foreign government. In other words, unless they imitated the Facebook guy who renounced his US Citizenship, investors have been paying taxes on foreign investments all along. Given that most corporations are multi-national businesses, very few investors are putting money into purely foreign companies. As far as the impact on development and the job market, demand and growth opportunities have much more to do with where investment money goes than nominal differences in capital gains taxes. Slashing capital gains taxes just doesn't magically create jobs. We've had 30 years to figure this one out.
1630;16950;retail banks;1;0;to make money get rich earn save;criticize retail banking as an unsustainable business model.;Long ago banks started to look towards fining their customers as a way of making money;This problem didn't just arrive with recent regulation. Long ago banks started to look towards fining their customers as a way of making money. This was accompanied by deceptive practices used to maximize the amercable events ergo some of the regulations. Indeed hitting upon fines as a profit center coincided with discovering that gambling with the free money customers provided was more profitable than providing services to customers and the community - like making loans. We all know how that ended. Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans.

It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world!
1632;786;your cat;1;0;get rid of the cat to be safe a good owner cats;the intention of the tweet towards 'your cat' is to express that the author had declawed their indoor cats, citing the need to make a decision between recovering a sofa or putting down the cat, and that they did not let their cats out as they kill too many birds.;Cats should not be let out in my view. They kill way too many birds;I have had cats, not now. The last two I had declawed. The first after a sofa we liked had to be recovered. It was either declaw or put down the cat. With the second one I made the decision so I would not have to either recover or put a cat down. Since both cats were indoor cats that NEVER went out I was not concerned with self defense. Only the front paws were declawed. Cats should not be let out in my view. They kill way too many birds. I loved both of these cats but I grew up on a farm and you don't get to sentimental about animals. They are for working or eating.

Encourage education;Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off.

These people have lost touch with the reality of the rest of us in a way comparable to that of any aristocracy in human history. And just like people stood up to the aristocracy in the great European revolutions of the 17th and 18th century, so we have to stand up to the new aristocracy in the 21st. We have to start somewhere - why not with ignoring these fat cat attempts to block our beach access with armed guards.

There were lots of suggestions - reading, math, history, how to write well, spelling, etc. It wasn't until someone said ""to learn how to learn"" that she was satisfied with the answer. I've never forgotten that lesson. One can quickly gather a lot of information on the internet, and I consider that to be a tremendous advance. But it takes critical thinking skills to turn that information into knowledge, to assess and weigh evidence, to draw well-reasoned conclusions and to present them persuasively. A well constructed research paper assignment can help hone those skills."

Because of our economic vigor and stability, and because of the (comparative though still less than perfect) integrity of our legal and financial institutions, the US will always be the most desirable choice for investors-and capital gains taxes (and other taxes) fund the regulatory, educational, and market infrastructure that make economic growth and individual business success more achievable here than anywhere else on earth. Dr. Miron's argument is ridiculous.

It is that lobby and the right wing extremist in Isreal who are jeopardizing the Israeli American alliance. Simply stated I do not want my son to die in a war created by Netanyau to support his radical agenda. If Israel strikes at Iran before the election to force Obama's hand their will be an anti Israeli firestorm in the US. The main casualty will be Isreali US relations which may never recover. Isrealis and their US lobby should not assume that a few fringe religious fanatics in the US speak for the majority of Americans

And the writer might want to check the veracity of the toothpaste story - it happened when Charles had a broken arm.
1642;5159;labor costs;1;0;to make money. a profit living money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the policy of keeping labor costs low to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich, which leads to the exploitation of american workers and keeps many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty.;If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down;"Dr Gallardo says: ""Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples)."" Now let's ask what Dr. Gallardo has avoided telling us: ""What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost."" In most agriculture, land rents, the landowners' profits are the major chunk of full costs. If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down, bearing the brunt of the increased cost of labor. There is no reason fore the land to disappear. There are not that many alternative uses. It's not like farmers, who claim to have built the land with their own two hands, will stop building land. Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich? Why is that a fair policy? And who among the Times six ""experts"" (including ""immigrant advocates"") is here to represent the interests of American workers who are required to work for less because of illegal immigration?"

Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students.
1644;17739;people;1;1;to make money. be in power the best charge;the intention of the tweet towards 'people' is to criticize their lack of standards and judgment, leading to the normalization of junk and the election of junk candidates.;People don't know any better, so they don't have the standards any more to;Once standards in culture, entertainment and politics are debased, it's much easer for media conglomerates to take advantage of this to rake in more profits. People don't know any better, so they don't have the standards any more to judge quality. The entertainment or media product can be easily assembled without real talent. This goes for our politics too, where the most outrageous platforms are offered to voters, in the expectation that these garbage proposals will get a candidate elected. What are being elected are junk candidates, but many voters don't realize it. They have often voted against their own interests, as has been widely noted. Once junk seems normalized, it's not called junk anymore.
1645;15284;tip;1;0;to be generous helpful nice fair show appreciation;the intention of the tweet is to encourage tipping as a way to determine len penzo's salary, with a standard tip of 18-20%.;I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to;I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.

One of the fundamental issues facing our society is that this avoidance of intellectual conflict leads to STUPID people, and an unwillingness to compromise for the betterment of society. Civil relations and critical thinking are dead under this model. Pick and Choose should be OPPOSED at ALL LEVELS. The only thing I have to say about getting old is that it is likely I will be dead and buried before this country implodes in a holocaust of partisan hate. But it will come.

Child molesters are limited in the jobs and activities the can have. I believe felons should be able to petition the courts and demonstrate they are a solid citizen and their full citizenship rights should be restored. Gun ownership should never be restored to violent felons. Just one man's opinion.

If we want quick gains, go for diesel. Even that faces issues in the US: refinery capacity, a tax system that paradoxically leaves gasoline cheaper. Diesel engines are more expensive than gasoline engines, but it wouldn't take much of a subsidy to encourage users to switch -- just look at Europe, where in some countries diesel is the norm and gasoline the exception.

The stated purpose of incarceration correction. In California it is the CDC or California Department of Corrections, not the prison department. A convict is released, put on parole, satisfies the requirements, and is expected to become a normal member of society. But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration? Some may be career criminals, but as we have seen fr to many times, most are not, but in many cases return to crime as that is what they know best. What we see here is a call for permanent retribution, no matter the crime."

As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary."

The idea that Christians hate Gays is an example of those adding fuel to the fire. Most of my intelligent and gifted Gay friends agree with me that the Gays has created more of the problem than they are willing to accept or change. Gays want those of all religions and different persuasions of faith to feel, act, accept and welcome them when they in turn are not willing to act, accept and welcome those who do not agree with their life style. I believe a Gay person can be a good Catholic, as does the Pope. I believe a Gay can be a Christian, as do most of my friends in the faith, but I can ask a Gay to accept me as a sinner, imperfect and less than God wants me to be. I do not understand why a Gay has to deny that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin. Just accept that.

If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance!

Would people of mixed race be given only a percentage of reparations equivalent to their African heritage? Would DNA tests be required for everybody? If the reparations wouldn't be race-based, what records would be used by people to prove that their ancestors were enslaved? Would descendants of white Quakers or poor white people (who were on record in the censuses as being non-slave owners) be required to pay too? Would descendants of white people from the North who fought in the Civil War against slavery have to pay as much as descendants of people from the Confederate states? What about financial accountability from descendants of Africans who are on record in the census as being slave-holders, or descendants of the tribespeople that helped facilitate the slave trade in Africa?

It has worked quite well -- I rather enjoy tipping generously for good service -- that sort of work, after all, is a livelihood for many and should be more widely regarded as a profession. But the no-tipping system does remove considerable uncertainty as to whom and how much to tip, which I think is a source of resentment for some people.

Why are we taxpayers paying millions of dollars for TFA and, here in NYC, NYC Teaching Fellows, et al while other grad students like myself are struggling to get through paying our own way and facing more and more miserable job prospects?? Why should I (and laid off teachers) have to compete with govt-sponsored, less-qualified drones who are hand-picked for their willingness to follow blindly if not for the fact that they water down the labor force in a period when the government is trying to undercut and underfund US education?

The result is a two-way mirror, with the citizen - Quran burning or not - sitting in the interrogation room, too comfortable in his or her biases or just too dumb to question the reflection before them.
1659;17612;fossil fuel exploitation;1;0;to save the environment be a leader in power charge;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the willingness of political parties to risk ecological disaster for the sake of fossil fuel exploitation.;It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great;As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse.
1660;15685;taxpayers fund airports;1;0;to get the best deal a good know truth price what is happening;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration and disappointment towards the lack of engagement on a post related to the funding of airports by taxpayers.;we have a vested interest and a right to know what is really going on;This was the best post and it's disappointing to see only 2 comments. What the other writers do not seem to grasp is that we the taxpayers fund airports, TSA, the roads to and from the airports, many of the employees, etc. In that sense, we have a vested interest and a right to know what is really going on. Shopping for fares on the internet is a joke-- usually when it comes right down to it, the buyer has to choose the most expensive option as that is the only workable arrangement.

I can see both sides of the argument;"No doubt about that!! I am a Turkish guy living in the US. I can see both sides of the argument. In my opinion, US has to stay neutral between Persian, Arabs and the Israel to be able to pursue its influence in the region. Right now common belief is US is unconditionally supporting Israel and this is hurting its interest in the Middle East. Remember this: Jews (Israel) and Muslims (Arabs, Iranians...) have been fighting for centuries, nobody can stop that. So, why would you position yourself in the middle of the conflict you know nobody can win. I think the answer is; because strong American Jewish lobby, Middle Eastern Warlords and the US Weapon Manufacturers want that way..."
1662;5603;same-sex colleges;1;1;to get a degree be the best job scientist successful;the intention of the tweet towards target'same-sex colleges' is to highlight the positive impact of women's colleges on promoting graduate school attendance and success for women in physical science fields.;I have a PhD in a physical science and received my undergraduate degree at a women;I have a PhD in a physical science and received my undergraduate degree at a women's college as did most women of my generation with a degree in a physical science. My school actively promoted me going on to graduate school. 100% of the women my senior class in chemistry went on to graduate school. This is the legacy of a women's college. The women who went to co-ed institutions told stories of harassment in the classroom and labs and found it difficult to obtain letters of recommendation let alone counseling and active support. Men in my graduate school were given forms for grants and scholarships while women were told they were a lost cause as the expectation was that they would soon marry and drop out. I don't think times have changed that much as I'm still one of a handful of women in my field and I'm not seeing a younger generation of women participating. BTW, I went to Mt. Holyoke College.

Read Diane Racitch's ""Death and Life of the Great American School System"". A former Bush ""supply sider"" discounts the widespread mantra that charter schools and choice are good for education. I have worked with home schooled children (mostly for religious reasons) and have not been impressed with the so called advantages."
1664;14871;american interference in the middle east;1;0;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet is to criticize american interference in the middle east and its impact on the region.;America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye;"America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why ""they"" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the ""Arab Spring"" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that ""you reap what you sow"". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a ""security"" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time."
1665;17649;human behavior;1;0;to be mean feel good cruel hurt someone;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the motivations behind human behavior, particularly in relation to compassion and cruelty.;There are no saints. We do what we do because it's gratifying.;There are no saints. We do what we do because it's gratifying. We are compassionate because it feels good. We are nasty for the same reason. That includes the woman who thought it was a good idea to withhold pain meds because she wanted the dying to suffer. Mother Teresa was a sadist.
1666;8825;mossoff;1;2;to be a scientist make point money. living;the intention of the tweet towards target'mossoff' is to criticize his reasoning on patentability of naturally occurring non-isolated electricity, rainwater, blood inside the body, and fingernails.;By Mr Mossoff's reasoning, naturally occurring non-isolated electricity (e;By Mr Mossoff's reasoning, naturally occurring non-isolated electricity (e..g, in thunderstorms) would not be patentable, but any use in a house would be. Similarly, rainwater would not be patentable, but water inside a building's plumbing system would be. Blood inside the body? Non-patentable. Stored in a bloodbank? Patentable! Fingernails could be grown without fear of lawsuit, but at the moment they are clipped, they would be the subject of litigation? Absurd, to say the least.
1667;16898;kids;1;1;to be helpful understood help people;the intention of the tweet towards 'kids' is to acknowledge that adhd is often overdiagnosed and that other conditions can present with attention and executive function problems, which may require a different approach to diagnosis and treatment.;using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at;Part of the problem, as evidenced here, is that child psychiatrists are not included in the discussion. I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension.

Whats worse, to my thinking is that people I know well enough to ask aren't that interested that someone else does. That disinterest, as far as I can see, represents an attitude less of ambivalence, than the far more worrisome kind...resignation. As any investment, compared to any other investment, will likely reflect as much on means as intentions, it might serve to consider that a tax policy that fosters, for lack of a better word ...hording ..might just run counter to the thinking of those of us who think that economic development and refinement are to be preferred to, perhaps...oh... atavism.
1669;21832;pot;1;2;to be a part of something good citizen person not racist;the intention of this tweet is to argue that illegal immigration negatively impacts education outcomes, contrasting it with legal immigration.;Arguing that legal immigration and illegal immigration together sometimes produce positive results is irration;Legal immigration is not the issue. Illegal immigration is the issue. Arguing that legal immigration and illegal immigration together sometimes produce positive results is irrational. We can have legal immigration without illegal immigration. The truth is that students whose families immigrate legally from Europe, Asia and Africa-but not Latin America-to the United States are more likely to graduate from high school than native-born students while students whose families immigrate illegally are far more likely to drop out than native-born students.
1670;3083;protestant;1;0;to be a racist in power control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'protestant' is to compare the historical conflict between catholics and protestants in europe with the current situation between israelis and palestinians, implying that the israelis' actions are motivated by anger at the palestinians' conversion to islam or christianity.;Are they angry at their conversion to Christianity or Islam?;The Catholics fought the Protestants for centuries in Europe, angry at their cousins' conversion. Now the Israelis are beating up on, discriminating against, stealing land from, destroying the centuries-old housing of, blocking the education of, jailing for decades, their genetic cousins the Palestinians. Are they angry at their conversion to Christianity or Islam?. Why should the United States collaborate with a discriminatory state?

Must be the influence of photo blogs!

I buy a share of ibm stock --where does the money go--sure not to ibm to create jobs! will ibm go up or down? will i make a profit or not? have i created job one? I might as well have taken the money to vegas and bet on red!! if i win there i will be taxed at my 35%....capital gains taxes are pure baloney and should be done away with--all income should be taxed at the same rate!
1673;5689;private shore lines;1;0;to be in control the river charge protect environment;the intention of the tweet is to criticize private shore lines and advocate for public access to rivers.;If you receive or need public help, then you need to provide public access;Those who privatize access to our shore lines are the first in line for public assistance when floods and hurricanes damage their private refuge. I live on the Boise River in an area that has kept access open to the public. Just downstream, a fence cuts off access to the river thanks to a handful of homeowners have turned the banks of the river into their private back yard. This would be impossible without the publicly funded Corp of Engineers and other public agencies that control river levels through dams and regulations. Last time the river became a bit unruly, the national guard was called out to move earth and place sandbags to protect these areas. If you receive or need public help, then you need to provide public access.

How will the Leaf do on a 95 degree summer afternoon in Houston with the a/c going full tilt and you are stuck in a freeway traffic jam for 90 minutes which frequently happens in all large cities? How will the Leaf do on -35 degree winter morning in Minneapolis and your commute is 25 miles each way and your place of work has only outdoor parking where the battery will remain well below zero and there is no recharging facility? Battery technology for the most part is stuck and until a breakthrough occurs in this area EV cars are a tiny niche.
1675;1359;overcrowding;1;0;to grow food make money get rich more;the intention of the tweet towards target 'overcrowding' is to highlight the negative impact of overpopulation on soil fertility.;fertility is slowly declining;Also, and usually not acknowledged, is that we are slowly eroding the fertility of the soil. There is no more usable soil, we are farming everything that can be farmed. Current methods depend on petrochemical fertilizers. Even with their use, fertility is slowly declining. As human population continues to grow, the result is obvious.
1676;4713;addiction treatment;1;1;to be a leader help others people;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for prioritizing education in addiction treatment.;marijuana regulation will generate revenue to support drug treatment for those who need and want it;Yes. Thank you. Except: > And for those who develop a substance dependency, marijuana regulation will generate revenue to support drug treatment for those who need and want it. That's the reactive approach. Resources do need to go to treatment. but also to prior education. The fact that people do not recognize alcohol as a far more dangerous drug than marijuana is more proof than we'd ever need that we are making rules without having even a basic understanding of the science or sociology of addiction.
1677;21800;business;1;2;to be in control a leader get drunk healthy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'business' is to criticize the legalization of alcohol and its promotion as a healthy option, suggesting that it is a harmful drug that should be banned.;If this guy was serious about health, he would call for alcohol prohibition;The fact that marijuana is vastly less harmful than alcohol or tobacco is completely ignored. If this guy was serious about health, he would call for alcohol prohibition. Why is alcohol okay? Because it's the drug of choice for white men. So he wants to live in a country where less harmful options to alcohol are illegal and those laws are enforced by judges and prosecutors who drink martinis to celebrate. Love this guy.
1678;7328;privatization;1;1;to be in charge control get rich make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'privatization' is to criticize it as a tool for exploitation of the middle class by the greedy rich.;Privatization is just another vehicle for exploitation of the middle class by the greedy rich;Conservative members of the GOP are the foremost advocates of privatization. They also deplore government regulation. We saw the result during the Bush administration. Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars were wasted on no-bid contracts uncompetitively awarded to corporations linked to Republicans including (especially) Vice President Dick Cheney. There was little to no oversight or accountability. Privatization is just another vehicle for exploitation of the middle class by the greedy rich.
1679;21711;walmart;1;2;to be helpful teach them help;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the value of parents reviewing homework with their children to reinforce learning, develop critical thinking, and provide individual attention often lacking in large classes.;if a child is able to feel comfortable discussing material with his or her parent,;Yes, it is important for children to learn how to do their homework by themselves. However, reviewing assignments with them can often help them to see where they made mistakes or help them to clarify matters that they may not fully understand. If a child is able to feel comfortable discussing material with his or her parent, there is an opportunity to reinforce what the child is learning. These interactions can build self-confidence and help to develop critical thinking. Students who are in large classes rarely get the type of individual attention in a class that they may receive from an involved parent at home. Sometimes revisiting the material at home can present a child with the opportunity to understand more about it.

For a justice to make such partisan remarks is unwise and unseemly. If somehow Mr. Trump were to actually make it to the White House, any issue about his actions or presidency coming before the court would, ethically, demand that Justice Ginsburg recuse herself.

Give the serves a living wage so they don';Having been in Japan and Europe, and New Zealand (where they earn a living wage and we don't have to tip), I LOVE IT! I am so tired of tipping. Give the serves a living wage so they don't have to count on the kindness of strangers. Yes, raise prices to accommodate a real wage--these people deserve it, just like anyone else who has a job. And eliminate the tips!

Cannabis isn't a gateway, it's a flagstone on a well worn path. Gateway? Sugar and caffeine are the first substances that one comes I contact with with mood altering properties, followed by alcohol. How many cannabis users have never tried alcohol or coffee or sugary caffeinated soda? The detractors of cannabis always seem to have a financial interest in vilifying it.
1683;9201;tax breaks;1;0;to be a good parent the kid learn. learn something in charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tax breaks' is to criticize the potential misuse of tax breaks for personal gain, resulting in negative consequences for the child's education.;I can imagine people pulling their kids out of school just to get a tax break and buy;Although this might work if everyone were reasonable, I can imagine people pulling their kids out of school just to get a tax break and buy a computer. The parent then monopolizes the computer all day, ignoring the kid, and the kid ends up learning next to nothing. When the kid gets tested, he's labeled learning disabled and gets remedial services from special educators paid for by everyone else's tax dollars. Lovely.

We stole that stuff but now that the shoe is on the other foot, the corporate line is ""Oh My Goodness, We Need Protection."" History laughs at nonsense."

Apart from the fun of the sport, spirit of the game attracted athletes away from their roots in more conventional referee based sports. The sport has grown tremendously in the past 20 years and there are now legions of ultimate players the world over--competitive athletes--who identify as ultimate players. They practice hard, they travel to compete, they are committed to the sport through playing, coaching, and leadership. Having represented my university, my hometown, and my country at national and world championships, I am thrilled that American boys and girls now playing for their middle school or high school teams will soon be playing for USA on the greatest stage of all. Ultimate will restore and advance the Olympic spirit. And yes, observers to settle disputes that players cannot themselves immediately settle is the way to go.

1687;20530;minor violation;1;2;to be generous fair polite helpful;the intention of this tweet is to raise awareness about the misconceptions around delivery charges and encourage empathy towards delivery personnel, advocating for fair compensation and treatment.;It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries;"It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a ""delivery charge"" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise ""free delivery"". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: ""Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?"" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can."

We are seeing cases of measles, mumps, etc. increase, and this cannot be all the fault of those who have lived with and been in contact daily in this country since birth with their peers who have been vaccinated. I'm old, and when in 1st grade, I contacted German measles. NOT from someone in my class and, in fact, no one seemed to know where I contacted it. I then proceeded to infect almost all my entire class apparently. My point in telling this story is that we cannot know exactly where a child gets his contact, and therefore IMO opinion, vaccinations should be mandatory for every child entering schools from pre-K up. Until everyone - from the child who comes with their parents to America to the kiddo next door, we have to be consistent.

1690;14630;same-sex colleges;1;1;to be a good person student have school teacher citizen;the intention of the tweet towards target'same-sex colleges' is to acknowledge their relevance and unique environment, while also acknowledging the challenges they face in terms of financial sustainability.;powerful reasons for same sex schools to exist with relevancy just as there is a;There are powerful reasons for same sex schools to exist with relevancy just as there is a place for the dominate mixed sex schools. Each type of school bring a unique environment for a student, that can be advantageous to a certain student. Granted that there is so few single sex schools, strong schools with managed financials and endowments can succeed. I am surprised that Sweet Briar did not go coed to save itself or were unwilling to try - there may have been other factors (financial) that did not allow it to do so.
1691;1226;electric vehicles;1;1;to save money money. energy be safe;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the impatience argument towards electric vehicles by comparing it to current refueling methods and emphasizing the potential benefits of electric cars once the infrastructure is in place.;Nuclear is costly, but is well suited for electric cars;It's not like people are driving up to a gas station and standing around waiting for the car to charge. They will charge while parked (say when they are at work and won't drive again until the end of the day) or overnight if they have a charging station at their house or on the street outside their house. So I think the impatience argument is wrong because you are comparing it to current refueling methods. Once the infrastructure is there, this shouldn't be an issue. I agree the government should be investing in R&D of new technology, as well as ensure the electric generators of the future are using cleaner technology. Nuclear is costly, but is well suited for electric cars, since the demand would theoretically increase in off peak hours.

When will a crowd arise that shouts, ""this Emperor has no clothes!"""
1693;14191;healthy cooking;1;1;to be healthy healthy. not hungry eat;the intention of the tweet is to promote healthy cooking by highlighting the nutritional benefits of various plant-based foods and suggesting flexibility in dietary choices.;Lentils, whole beans, millets are great sources of B vitamins;Lentils, whole beans, millets are great sources of B vitamins, their bioavailability increases if they are soaked overnight. Millets can even be sprouted then pound into a flour, they are gluten free. Some millets contain high amounts of calcium as well. Quinoa is another rich source of nutrition all around. As far as brain food is concerned, dairy and dairy products make up for lack of meat protein. However for stric vegans who exclude fairly products or those with lactose intolerance, meat and meat products is a good option. Being flexible is a great thing, being too strict or restrictive doesn't help anyone. Moderation is key, mix of vegetarianism, non vegetarianism is awesome, if one is willing to be flexible. Life is colorful not black and white so why limit food?

Religious freedom is not an unqualified right, and public health must trump a parent's objections to vaccination based on religious grounds. Besides, the parents are putting the risk of disease on the child, not themselves. This is child abuse, in my opinion.

Every time schools at any level, or education systems anywhere, or the ones who teach get tested or graded or rated somehow, it is always the teachers who get fired. Never the students.

Any new weapon can be ultimately used against its developer: tanks against the British, SAMs against the US. Atomic and nuclear bombs have done the opposite of making the US more secure. What will our security be like when drones are very numerous, when they can be controlled by mobile phones, and when we have made so many enemies?

And yet, we are the better for it - each child has their own different level of achievement. I couldn't push him to achieve even if I wanted to, and I am glad that I have learned the folly of that desire so early.
1699;1852;voting rights;1;1;to be able vote a good citizen person leader;the intention of the tweet is to argue for the restoration of voting rights for convicted felons.;felons who have regained the right to vote and actively engage in the voting;Studies and statistics have shown that felons who have regained the right to vote and actively engage in the voting process are significantly less likely to reoffend. On that alone, society benefits. Based on past standards for disenfranchisement, neither George W. Bush or Dick Cheney would have been able to vote in years past. Andrew Jackson killed two people in duels. Times change and our standards evolve. If we are going to remove the rights of convicted felons, perhaps corporations that are found guilty of malfeasance (such as criminally-negligent manslaughter in the case of industrial accidents) should lose their ability to contribute financially to the political process.
1700;5391;new zealand;1;0;to be a leader save money the country farm successful;the intention of the tweet towards new zealand is to praise the country's agricultural industry for its prosperity and success in the global market, despite earlier concerns about the elimination of farm subsidies.;New Zealand eliminated farm subsidies years ago amidst much howling that the sky is falling from;New Zealand eliminated farm subsidies years ago amidst much howling that the sky is falling from the ag industry. Now they sing a different tune as the NZ ag industry is world class and prospering from a large export component.
1701;11424;motherhood;1;1;to be a good parent person have life citizen;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of the social circle a child is born into in the context of motherhood, specifically in relation to grandparents and the potential impact of delayed parenthood on a child's life.;One of the saddest consequences of delaying children is the vanishing odds of seeing;"One of the saddest consequences of delaying children is the vanishing odds of seeing grandchildren, especially if there are several generations in a row that delayed, and the result is children that just do not have grandparents. I know such children, and they are sad. No amount of positive thinking and ""there are all kinds of families"" on the part of the parents can ease that pain. It's really disheartening listening to a kid tell you that, despite many uncles, aunts and cousins, they have ""a small family"", because they have no grandparents... How they wish they knew those grandparents, and wonder what they were like. Beyond covering the basics, money doesn't matter so much to kids, nor does status, nor material things nor travel, but what does matter to them is the people around them. There are all kinds of reasons to delay, but among the ""know what you're doing if you delay"" advice, I think the social circle a child is born into should take high priority - both in terms of the grandparents they may not have, and in terms of the parents who may not even live to see that child graduate from college..."

It has been a wonderful experience for him; he loves the competition and the team spirit, but everyone understands that academics comes first."
1703;7587;legalization;1;0;to see what people think know the truth truth. is happening;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the validity of the claim that there is high popular support for legalization of illegal immigrants, and to argue that the opposite is true based on the rise of politicians campaigning against illegal immigration.;I keep reading this bogus claim peddled by pro-amnesty enthusiasts;"""Despite consistently high popular support for legalization, Congress has failed to act."" I keep reading this bogus claim peddled by pro-amnesty enthusiasts about enormous support for ""legalization"" of illegal immigrants, but have yet to see any evidence of it. As a matter of fact, the reverse is true as proven by the rise of Trump and other politicians who are campaigning against illegal immigration. Why does the NYT keep publishing this falsehood?"
1704;4890;states-righters;1;1;to be in control charge independent free;the intention of the tweet towards'states-righters' is to suggest that they may support the idea of total fealty to their state and avoiding any responsibility to a larger polity.;States-Righters ought to love this, huh? It certainly has precedents and;Hmmm... the States-Righters ought to love this, huh? It certainly has precedents and does not seem prima facie unconstitutional. After all, would not a lot of Texans, Alaskans, and others enjoy giving total fealty to their state and avoiding any responsibility to a larger polity? No? When enough people realize that immigration is driven by forces much stronger and more pervasive than domestic policy, that it cannot be eliminated by laws, fences, patrols, or any other local action, and that it will continue to be the boon for us that it has always been, perhaps then a rational discussion will ensue.
1705;2604;companies;1;0;to be in control have a monopoly charge make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'companies' is to criticize the patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences and its negative impact on medical care for seriously ill patients.;The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone;Every thing found in nature got to be by some kind of mutation and even engineered genes are now found in nature. The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.
1706;16188;dual citizens;1;1;to be a good citizen parent person make choice have;the intention of the tweet is to express satisfaction with being a dual citizen, balancing opportunities in both countries.;It seems an ideal arrangement, as they & I balance the great opportunities in the US;My 4 children & I are all dual citizens of Canada & the US. It seems an ideal arrangement, as they & I balance the great opportunities in the US vs the great benefits (free health care, great affordable higher education, stable economy, banks, etc.) as well as opportunity in Canada. I & they can choose whichever course/country seems best. Meanwhile, we are each happy to support (with taxes) whichever country we are living in.
1707;21831;food labeling;1;2;to be a part of something good citizen person not racist;the intention of this tweet is to argue that illegal immigration negatively impacts education outcomes, contrasting it with legal immigration.;I don't care about food labeling;Legal immigration is not the issue. Illegal immigration is the issue. Arguing that legal immigration and illegal immigration together sometimes produce positive results is irrational. We can have legal immigration without illegal immigration. The truth is that students whose families immigrate legally from Europe, Asia and Africa-but not Latin America-to the United States are more likely to graduate from high school than native-born students while students whose families immigrate illegally are far more likely to drop out than native-born students.
1708;5511;outsourcing of american jobs;1;0;to get a better job be good teacher rid of poverty person;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the outsourcing of american jobs.;the outsourcing of American jobs by multinational companies;I have to disagree with my colleague from Temple University, where I have taught in the business school for 37 years. The unemployment rate for African-Americans has been double the overall rate for many decades. It is and has been an outrage. But where is the evidence that it has anything to do with immigration? Jobs for Americans and adequately funded schools for Philadelphians are big problems, but what do they have to do with immigration. Rather all of these issues have to do with the outsourcing of American jobs by multinational companies and by the strangehold the anti-tax party has in our state legislatures and Congress.
1709;4474;felons vote;1;1;to be a citizen free independent vote;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the right to vote for felons.;Most definitely, I agree that felons should be allowed to vote;Most definitely, I agree that felons should be allowed to vote. Their rights should not even be suspended in my opinion, not for a day. Taking away the right to vote is the ultimate affront in a so-called democracy, and it helps create the downward spiral of criminals in our system. It is just another reason that once a person becomes a felon, they have very little chance of ever succeeded in this country. They'd be much better off leaving the country, however even that right is removed. Criminals are citizens too. This antiquated idea of removing voting rights is akin to the policies you see in North Korean.
1710;15027;study;1;0;to be a leader get job independent ahead;the intention of the tweet towards the target'study' is to express a negative opinion about home schooled kids based on personal experience.;Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids, I do know that;Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids, I do know that, having hired two of them, my impression is not favorable. Both were prima donnas who spent a lot of time complaining about work rules, who thought that they should be able to change work processes to suit them, and who resorted to crying and making scenes to try and get their way with co-workers. The public school system was established primarily as a benefit to society, not just the individual child. That is why we all pay taxes to the schools whether we have kids or not. If people want to take their children out, so be it -- but they still still have their obligation to support the schools.
1711;9979;pet;1;1;to be left alone in control charge independent;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'pet' is to support responsible pet ownership and the decision-making abilities of competent vets.;There may be legitimate reasons for de-clawing. A responsible pet owner and a competent;Here's some over-regulation to an absurd degree. There may be legitimate reasons for de-clawing. A responsible pet owner and a competent and compassionate vet should be left alone to make the right decision for each animal. If the pet owner is irresponsible and the vet is not competent, then there are way bigger problems at play than claws. Doesn't our legal system have enough to do without this nonsense?
1712;292;teachers;1;1;to be in charge make money. control money;criticizes the private education industry's focus on minimizing labor costs and maximizing profits, and argues that teachers will eventually be replaced by semiskilled educational associates.;Teachers will in fact eventually be replaced by semiskilled educational associates who will facilitate;An unfortunate example of agenda setting by the Times. No one argues that less experience would be a plus for a lawyer, a physician, a nurse, a journalist, a policeman, an accountant, or, for that matter, a fry cook. Yet the private education industry's rationale for hiring and retention policies that are clearly driven by minimization of labor costs and maximization of profits is somehow worthy of serious consideration. Similarly, we are asked to believe that talent, expertise, and wisdom in the realm of education is offered by wealthy philanthropists, corporate executives, consultants, and government officials, but not by those who actually teach students. Unfortunately, there's just too much potential profit to made to allow public education in its present form to remain. Teachers will in fact eventually be replaced by semiskilled educational associates who will facilitate delivery of uniform content centrally developed by corporations. Platform standardization will allow content development to be offshored. With any luck, my kids will be finished with school before that day comes.
1713;5364;fast food;1;0;to help the poor be a doctor obese save lives;the intention of the tweet towards target 'fast food' is to criticize the role of fast food in contributing to the obesity epidemic and to suggest that employers should discriminate against overweight individuals in the workplace.;I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the;"I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese ""he could not earn a living (sic!)"". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid."
1714;10558;america;1;0;to be a leader express his opinion their hero;criticize america for not tolerating defacement of koran, call for standing up to islam's intolerance.;Burn an American flag, ok, rip up a photo of the Pope,;Sadly, at some point this is about a different sent of rules for Muslims. Burn an American flag, ok, rip up a photo of the Pope, ok, this is America. But deface a Koran and you are called out as an intolerant bigot. This is wrong on the face of it. And at the root is Islam's own intolerance. Strongly criticize their religion and they want to not just protest, but kill you. We need to stand up to this bullying. To the specific issue in this case, yes, fire the worker, if you also fire a worker who burns an America flag during an anti-war rally. Of course we know this wouldn't happen.
1715;11539;educational training;1;1;to teach others be helpful help people;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the lack of educational training for college graduates who are expected to teach children.;Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned;Teaching is a profession. Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students.
1716;4359;citizen;1;1;to be in power charge control a leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'citizen' is to express disgust and criticize the gop for prioritizing power over democracy.;Of course ANYONE who is a citizen has the right to vote!;I'm disgusted that this is even a question. Of course ANYONE who is a citizen has the right to vote! It is just sickening that partisan jerks from the GOP care more about gaining power so they can personally profit than they are about Democracy. Next, you fools will say you can only vote if you have a job, or own a house.

The release from prison after having met all the criteria for the sentence affirms their debt to society has been met, but you want to impose more? Pray tell, how does one satisfy the ""new leaf"" criteria? How long does it take? All Mr. Clegg's position does is try to justify a limitation on earned freedom. Our Founding Fathers would find that unconscionable."
1718;9726;a way to sell what was once free;1;0;to make more money money. a profit be fair;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the commercialization of previously free or low-cost activities.;this is pretty confusing and seems like sophisticated irrelevance;this is pretty confusing and seems like sophisticated irrelevance. a restaurant can charge a minimum of $100 for a meal and a movie $20 for a ticket and we don't seem to get upset about the fact that the poor are denied access, but if the meal is $75 and the move $15 and reservations an extra $10 or $3 then there's an equity issue worthy of public debate. In each case the seller has the right to maximize revenue and the buyer (as those of us who buy airline tickets know well) to weigh whether extra charges for priority access are a worthwhile investment.
1719;5637;teacher;1;1;to teach others be helpful educated;the user expresses criticism of the minimal training required for teach for america teachers, arguing it devalues teaching as a true profession and hinders building a first-class educational system, while endorsing diane ravitch's book for further insights.;I whole-heartedly support Ms. Crocco's observations;A retired teacher who observed, and often mentored, many Teach for America teachers, I whole-heartedly support Ms. Crocco's observations. In what other profession would it be assumed that minimal training, no matter how well-educated one happens to be, is sufficient to enter the field: law, medicine? The fact we not only allow it, but encourage such an approach in eduction to me says a great deal about how teaching is viewed in this country, that is, it is not truly a profession. One will never build a first-class educational system based on this widely held conviction. For further thoughts, I refer the reader to the book by Diane Ravitch (one of the best historians of American schools) The Death and Life of the Great American School system.
1720;203;diversity;1;1;to help the poor be a leader make point difference;the intention of the tweet towards target 'diversity' is to criticize the pc nonsense about diversity.;Except for the PC nonsense about diversity, this makes a great deal of sense;Except for the PC nonsense about diversity, this makes a great deal of sense. No essays, though that point to one of the main benefits of technology -- increases in productivity that increase per capita economic output and are doing far more to drive the reduction of poverty that is occurring in the world as a whole than the small scale feel good efforts you and others have mentioned.
1721;20249;ivf;1;2;to be healthy healthy. a vegetarian healthier;the intention of this tweet is to argue that a high animal fat western diet, rather than vegetable consumption, is a major contributor to issues like obesity and high medical costs.;ivf is not the answer;Look at the human species not other animal species. It's not vegies and whole foods that make a major portion of Western diet eaters overweightt and obese. It's not vegies that puts a major portion of the US population on statins to reduce bad cholesterol. It's not vegies that are helping to raise medical costs to astronomical heights.Perhaps a major portion of the problem lies in the high animal fat Western diet.
1722;7411;a palestinian state;1;1;to be in control power a leader charge;the intention of the tweet towards a palestinian state is to criticize and condemn the historical actions of the french, british, american, and soviet empires in denying the human rights of christian muslim arab palestinians in their natural homeland, and to argue that such actions set a dangerous precedent for the invasion and occupation of other lands.;Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the;Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization.
1723;12248;common decency;1;1;to be left alone avoid conflict. conflict not bothered;the intention of the tweet towards target 'common decency' is to express frustration and concern about the lack of intellectual conflict and critical thinking in society, and the negative impact it has on civil relations.;STUPID people;One of the horrible developments of the internet age is that people can actively avoid those topics they do not agree with or which cause them distress. One of the fundamental issues facing our society is that this avoidance of intellectual conflict leads to STUPID people, and an unwillingness to compromise for the betterment of society. Civil relations and critical thinking are dead under this model. Pick and Choose should be OPPOSED at ALL LEVELS. The only thing I have to say about getting old is that it is likely I will be dead and buried before this country implodes in a holocaust of partisan hate. But it will come.
1724;7868;everyone;1;1;to be healthy healthy. a vegetarian vegan healthier;the intention of the tweet is to encourage respect for individual choices and not to impose dietary restrictions on children.;It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not;A great article. Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond proving the scientific information in the article to be wrong, it will be very difficult to come to another conclusion than the author arrives at. Vegetarianism and veganism are mainly moralistic choices of life style, and should be presented as such. But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children.
1725;4196;genes;1;1;to be in control charge a scientist make money;the intention of the tweet is to argue against gene patenting.;No they should not be able to patent a human gene;No they should not be able to patent a human gene. They didn't create it. The gene has been there all along. Certainly the company owns the testing mechanism they develop. If someone developed a technique to alter genes so they are not destructive to us, that method is theirs to patent. But the ownership of the gene belongs to the people who carry them.
1726;2639;invest;1;1;to save for retirement be fair money avoid taxes;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for tax-efficient investment strategies in retirement accounts and savings accounts.;I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax;I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax rates on them are bupkis until I either roll over money to a Roth or withdraw from my IRA - which money (including gains) is then taxed like regular income. Conversely, gains in a mature Roth IRA aren't taxed when I eventually draw down from that account. Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates. Interest earned on FDIC protected savings accounts of $250K or under (the account balance, NOT $250K in interest) should also be exempt, and above that fully taxable. This would protect middle class savers should they ever actually see interest beyond pennies in their accounts.
1727;8766;single sex schools;1;1;to be educated inclusive learn something;the intention of the tweet towards target'single sex schools' is to defend and promote the validity of single sex education as a choice for some individuals.;The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly;Wanting to go to a single sex school is no different ultimately than wanting to go to a warm weather school or a school in the mountains or a snowy New England school. It is a landscape with a lot of valid choices. If you've ever visited Wellesley or Smith you will see an amazing learning environment in both locales. That schools struggle and go away is a natural thing: the landscape changes and the choices have increased dramatically. The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly. It is not for everybody but please don't come up with theories to suggest it is not a choice for some: remember we've cultivated a pluralistic society where our wants and needs understandable differ.

ISIS might not yet be the existential threat posed by the Axis powers but it is heading that way. Point being that we should do whatever is necessary short of WMD to defeat this evil. Even if it means cooperating with Assad whose regime, while brutal, poses no threat to the US.

Of course it's a PR move, but it';Safeguarding the public's health is primarily the responsibility of the public - a small but important point. I say good for Walmart. Of course it's a PR move, but it's a good one. Michelle Obama being at their announcement was a PR move, heck, the State of the Union is a PR move. If you are looking for different motives from business or government you are dreaming.
1730;21836;pas play;1;2;to have a healthy baby good birth safe be parent child;the intention of the tweet towards target 'pas play' is to express dissatisfaction with the healthcare system and the lack of support for home births.;I would have liked to end my second, low-risk pregnancy with a home birth;I would have liked to end my second, low-risk pregnancy with a home birth at our home a mile from two hospitals with full maternity wards and neonatal intensive care. This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America.

That proposition that has me paying 10x more taxes for my house than my neighbor in an identical house next door, and my neighbor across the street, in a mirror image house paying 4x more than me. It is an immoral law, that also buried California's once envious education system ... but that's what you get with republicans: Lack of willingness to fund infrastructure of the state or nation makes the nation grate not great.
1732;21221;israel stay;1;2;to be a leader in control charge fair;the intention of the tweet is to criticize israel's decision to close schools for the deaf, arguing that it is a violation of the right to equal education and an attack on the needs of a marginalized group.;It's sad an ludicrous that this should even be open to debate;"It's sad an ludicrous that this should even be open to debate...all citizens have the right to an equal education in order to have some chance at equal opportunity, and it seems pretty obvious that schools for the deaf are essential to giving them equal opportunity. So, advocates for closing these schools to cover a budgetary gap would seem to be saying ""hey, it's ok to deny rights to a segment of society if they're not large enough to protest"". Bad enough that our educational system is inadequate as it is, but to deny a whole class of people anything approaching an adequate education is ludicrous. Can anyone on the other side of this issue lay claim to being interested in the needs of all citizens? Oh, I suppose 'the market' will step in and fill this need? Please."
1733;1122;income;1;1;to be a leader in power control change the system fair;the author expresses frustration with perceived attempts to undermine the elimination of racial preferences in voting, while still supporting education opportunities for disadvantaged children.;I support the effort to give any child with distinct socioeconomic disadvantages the pathway to a;What was the voter's intent in Michigan, California, and Florida? Was it to replace overt racial preferences with similar but less transparent and complex racial preferences? No. It was to eliminate racial preferences. PERIOD. How is this not clear? Those here who openly discuss and plan to subvert the will of the voters based on their personal ideology is a disgrace to our system. You've been ordered by the voters to stop this, so stop it. Now. I support the effort to give any child with distinct socioeconomic disadvantages the pathway to a college education, but I don't support it as solely a means to an end to implement the same racial preferences that were just banned.
1734;12017;home-schoolers;1;1;to have fun be competitive successful learn;the intention of the tweet is to promote home schooling as a good option for education and to suggest alternative activities for home schoolers that mix academics and competition, such as interscholastic speech competition and chess.;Home school is good thing;Home school is good thing. I've had great success in the classroom at the college level with home school students. Sports is not academics. There seems to be some value in permitting home school students to play sports from the social development perspective. As far as competition is concerned. A more appropriate mix of academics and competition is interscholastic speech competition (forensics and debate) and chess. These activities mix competition and academics much better. In fact, I believe funding for the above activities should be equal to sports. They also serve title nine objectives and should be counted as interscholastic competition activity, just like sports in competitive activity with some thinking taking place.
1735;7078;tax breaks;1;0;to get a better job be good parent the best best. education;the author's intention towards tax breaks is negative, as they believe the idea of home schooling is egotistically self-indulgent and that homeschooling parents are not qualified to teach.;The whole idea of home schooling seems egotistically self-indulgent in;Wow, really!? I'd be for if my wife and I can get a tax break from school taxes altogether. Since we don't and won't have children the tax break would do wonders for our economic recovery. The whole idea is bogus. The whole idea of home schooling seems egotistically self-indulgent in the first place. If the homeschooling parents aren't happy with the current state of the schools why not become teachers themselves? They obvously think they're more qualified than the professionals presently doing the job. Just because you think you can do a better job than someone else doesn't mean you ACTUALLY can do it better.
1736;15773;faulty products;1;0;to avoid being sued be in control charge power;the intention of the tweet towards 'faulty products' is to advocate for more regulation to protect consumers from harm caused by faulty products.;IF we had effective means for using civil law to receive just compensation for the harm that is;Less regulation might be feasible IF we had effective means for using civil law to receive just compensation for the harm that is caused by faulty products. Unfortunately, conservative judges and law makers dedicated to protecting their business patrons have succeeded in emasculating our ability to use civil law for relief. Recent NYT articles have revealed how business has been using arbitration to avoid be sued. Wise law makers and judges work to protect the public from harm, but it seems that wisdom is lacking in far too many current law makers and judges. Greed is winning!
1737;15369;a bad deal for cities and states;1;0;to help the poor be a leader save money free;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the privatization of public services and the negative impact it can have on the economy.;The only way to fix the economy is eliminating NAFTA and bringing back Clinton era;The same people pushing for privatization are the same ones who laid out the plans for Pinochet in Chile. Look what it did to their economy. The only way to fix the economy is eliminating NAFTA and bringing back Clinton era corporate taxes.

But add religion to it and suddenly anyone who objects to importing more immigrants with these abhorrent beliefs is a 'racist' and 'xenophobe'. Political correctness and cowardice will be the death of the civilized world.

I do not abide religious exemptions for anything that affects public health and welfare (and that includes property taxes as well as vaccinations, military service, etc.) We must stop allowing those who believe fairy tales to influence public policy.

(that means, American children are the most heavily vaccinated in the world) And yet, more than half of that most vaccinated U.S. children suffer from chronic illnesses or obesity.

I have a drink now and then, but do not smoke cigarettes. None of the people I know, not one of them, who smoke joint have any inclination toward using harder drugs. I've never tried pot brownies but perhaps I'd like them better than smoking which cannot be good for my lungs. My sense is people who use hard drugs are predisposed to their use and not pushed along by toking on a pipe of mary jane. I feel strongly that commentaries such as this written by people in positions affecting laws mislead and in turn do much more harm than good.

Today we glorify money and fame, and we allow individuals to glorify themselves and their clients, not the average pedestrian who must increasingly suffer unfriendly streets with wall-like façades protecting the elites inside, or forbidding store fronts keeping the riff raff out of luxury stores and creating bleak streets once business is over. I'm a liberal and not elitist and I am a fan of modernism and some of the modern facades. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I bet, in one hundred years or so, we will rue the day we destroyed livability and proportion and replace these monstrosities with user friendly edifices similar to the ones which were destroyed to make way for the monstrosities.

As a matter of fact, just about every other country should follow this as well. There are already a number of government offices in Jerusalem not to mention a number of reference books that acknowledge it as Israel's capital. The only reason why none of the embassies were in Jerusalem originally was because it was supposed to be an international zone according to the partition plan by the UN.
1745;285;tax;1;1;to educate their children his child be educated helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tax' is to argue that taxes are not equal to tuition and that homeschooling parents should support public schools because they indirectly benefit from them.;Taxes do NOT equal tuition, a point many, many commenters and writers miss;Taxes do NOT equal tuition, a point many, many commenters and writers miss. All taxpayers pay for public education, because an educated populace is a benefit for the entire society. Homeschooling parents believe they provide their children a better service than the government can. Great, many can. Those same homeschooling parents get indirect benefits from public education: reduced crime, a better economy, and a more cohesive community. They should support the public schools, just as childless people do.
1746;20388;veganism;1;2;to get rid of competition employees be in control charge;the intention of this tweet is to argue that non-compete clauses in small businesses are typically used to prevent salespeople from leaving to work for competitors, rather than protecting high-cost, proprietary products.;I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at;I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains.

It must stop now. If we have to pay a bit more for food so be it. No one accepts former complaints that ending black slavery would raise the cost of cotton cloth, so why do we dare mention the cost of ending agricultural worker slavery. Mechanize these picking jobs and pay American workers a decent wage to do the work of several immigrant slaves as we have done in every other industry. Farmers and other businesses who can not make a profit without slave labor should go out of business or get into another business.

We are all not able to distinguish true medical research from personal stories, true, but if at the very least it starts a conversation between us and our medical provider that's a good thing. Any doctor not willing to discuss what I have read or learned, including the ability to admit not having too much knowledge about some particulars but willing to find out or point me in a good direction, are blessed with me finding one who will. It's my body, I am adamant about being involved in what happens to it.

Some children do need a parent or adult there to contain the frustration and model working habits.

Anyone who wants it can get it;"""People who are addicted to marijuana are three times more likely to be addicted to heroin."" Since there is NO such thing as addiction to marijuana, the above is total nonsense. I know people who smoke 5-6 joints a day every single day, and then go without it during 4 week vacation overseas without missing a bit. Neither cigarette smokers, nor heroin addicts can do that. ""The legalization of marijuana increases availability of the drug and acceptability of its use. "" There is no problem with availability of marijuana without legalization. Anyone who wants it can get it within 2 hours at most, right here in NYC."

If A then B is not equivalent to if B;Classic Bayesian inference error. If A then B is not equivalent to if B then A. But it worked for Johnny Cochran in the OJ Simpson trial, who (correctly) argued that the percentage of verified wife beaters who go on to murder their wives is very, very small, but also ignored the fact that the percentage of verified wife beaters whose wives are then murdered and who are guilty approaches 100%.

Sooner than later, the majority member countries will follow suit. The (official line) arguments presented by Ms. Leibovich come too little, too late. Israel has always ignored UN pledges for good faith negotiations with the Palestinians because US unwavering support. Washington, however, is losing diplomatic control over its allies and friends. Israel soon will be facing (another) awkward diplomatic position at the UN. It will be occupying land of an invaded sovereign state recognized by the world community. A good challenge for the able Israeli-American diplomacy to defend at the UN.
1753;20301;support kurd;1;2;to be a good citizen person free from prison free.;the intention of this tweet is to express the author's belief in the restorative power of punishment, advocating for voting rights and societal reintegration of individuals after they have served their prison sentence.;I don't think anybody should be voting while incarcerated;I don't think anybody should be voting while incarcerated. The point of a criminal sentence is to deny criminals, for a period, the rights and freedoms of a citizen. But once someone is released from prison, surely they should have a chance to reintegrate. Haven't they paid their debt? To say to someone who stole a car at 17 that they can NEVER again be a full citizen is completely unjust.

I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting.

It reversed my heart disease;About B-12. My understanding is that normally, before people started eating so many dead animals, B-12 would come from the bacteria from the dirt on the raw vegetables that people would eat. Also, before we became so scrupulous about washing the dirt off plants before eating them. Also, before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants. Maybe also before we started pasteurizing so many things. Maybe the right probiotics would help. I went vegan a couple of years ago. It reversed my heart disease - no maybe.

The rest of these wimpy musings are proof of how far we've gotten away from understanding what guys can and should be doing in relationships, families, and the world at large.

The embargo has throttled down major trade along the Mississippi affecting trade from New Orleans to Chicago. The lost trade and development is astronomical. We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies. US policy is driven by emotion rather than any realistic policy that might bring about change. How long must the people of the United States be forced to maintain a foolish policy driven by the self interests of a small politically connected community?

Nestle makes the obesity epidemic sound;calories in/calories out is a fallacy. Nestle makes the obesity epidemic sound like it is a matter of people simply eating too many calories. It is too many carbs, and in particular refined sugars. Also, fruit isn't that great--go w/veggies. These are all terrible contributors to the problem of obesity.
1759;15267;tax system;1;0;to get rich be fair make money;criticize the tax system.;If capital gains are untaxed, that means that the income tax system will become extremely;The money has to come from somewhere. If capital gains are untaxed, that means that the income tax system will become extremely regressive, with the wealthiest Americans paying virtually no taxes, and/or another tax, such as a national sales tax (also regressive) would have to be implemented. Since this scenario takes a lot of dollars out of the pockets of average people who spend their income, demand would take a huge hit. How would that impact growth and job creation? Miron's proposal is, of course, just another permutation of supply side economics. It WILL be unfair, and it won't work.

This is what will solve the health care crisis in this country? Seriously? I would laugh if the problem weren't so serious.

After taking Jeffrey Sachs' and Peter Singer's courses online via Coursera for free, it is abundantly clear to me that from the perspectives of economic development, sustainability and ethics all that Mr. Nair concludes is true. Problem is whether it is simply human nature which will prevent us from overcoming our collective addictions to ego and hedonism, and that balance with humility is an ephemeral conceit.

I would like to know, though, if anyone has ever experienced over-salting by a chef. I had one bad experience where the food was exteremely over-salted.

1764;2286;academic;1;1;to be a doctor help the poor in control charge;criticizes academic institutions for perpetuating conflicts in the medical field and contributing to the opioid epidemic.;Many Medical Schools have found it necessary to exclude Pharmaceutical Reps and others from access to their students;Beyond any doubt, it should be. There are those who claim that such training occurs in medical school and at CME following graduation. Under whose auspices? Some Medical Schools have found it necessary to exclude Pharmaceutical Reps and others from access to their students and Residents on their premises. Many of these opioid manufacturers continue to fund various research and teaching projects at these hospitals and universities. It is a system full of conflicts, all of which do not favor the patient. Doctors and other providers continue to end up in court and jail because of intentional involvement in the cycle of drug abuse. Opioid training is an answer but may not be the only one. We may also need to clean up Faculties, test books and the way in which we choose those who enter medical school. Many doctors really feel that they do no wrong.
1765;8245;behavior;1;0;to be inclusive respectful fair free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'behavior' is to criticize it as appalling and immoral.;I find Mr. Fenton's behavior appallingly violent and highly immoral;While I find Mr. Fenton's behavior appallingly violent and highly immoral, I also find the long reach of his employer's arm legally unsupportable. I wouldn't be surprised to see this man reinstated in the backlash. Being a democracy has always meant tolerating all manner of disrespectful and hateful language - as long as it remains language and not a specific call to violent action.

Either he didn't read the column, or he is so convinced of his beliefs that he ignores facts/data. There appears to be NO instance of something that should not be privatized, despite the evidence to the contrary presented by Dr. (?) Warner. If he wants me to support privatization of specific services, show me some data!

Jews have been living in the Land of Israel for thousands of years; even during of times that most of the Jewish people was at exile, and before the Arab occupation and colonialization of the land. It is mind bugling how people are willing to accept this ongoing occupation, just because they think Arabs lived there sine dinosaurs time. Most of the Arab immigrated there parallel to the Zionist immigration in the new era. Read the Ottoman census, the British census and understand the Arab names and origins. Take a look at the big picture; a huge part of the globe is Christian, another huge part of the globe is Muslim. There is a little tiny piece of land for the Jews, and the Liberal of the free world want to take it away."

1769;20932;foreign language class;1;2;to be a leader make difference point noticed change;the author's intention is to criticize activists and politicians on school boards, arguing they prioritize personal agendas over adequately funding and improving education.;a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's;One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards and prevent people who have the interest and learning to keep the schools funded and educating students well from serving on the Boards. These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts.
1770;14505;california university;1;0;to get a better education good job degree;criticize the uc system's admissions policy and its impact on california students' education and future prospects.;a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year;The UC system was envisioned in the 1960's to admit 13% of California high school students. Today, in practice, approximately 9% are admitted. Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy. The State of California ends up with a large number of students who are less educated, have higher debt rates, or leave the state permanently.

The inference by this statement is thus that cigarettes or beer are gateway drugs to marijuana use. What next? Would a campfire or mowing the lawn on a hot afternoon be gateway activities to beer?

1775;21511;flag burning;1;2;to be healthy healthy. not hungry eat;the intention of this tweet is to promote a flexible approach to diet and nutrition, emphasizing the benefits of a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods, and highlighting the nutritional value of various plant-based and animal-based sources.;stric vegans who exclude fairly products or those with lactose intolerance;Lentils, whole beans, millets are great sources of B vitamins, their bioavailability increases if they are soaked overnight. Millets can even be sprouted then pound into a flour, they are gluten free. Some millets contain high amounts of calcium as well. Quinoa is another rich source of nutrition all around. As far as brain food is concerned, dairy and dairy products make up for lack of meat protein. However for stric vegans who exclude fairly products or those with lactose intolerance, meat and meat products is a good option. Being flexible is a great thing, being too strict or restrictive doesn't help anyone. Moderation is key, mix of vegetarianism, non vegetarianism is awesome, if one is willing to be flexible. Life is colorful not black and white so why limit food?
1776;106;netanyahu;1;0;to be a leader in control power charge;criticizes netanyahu's actions and behavior on american soil.;In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that;I think that Mr. Miller is really burying his head in the sand here, to the point of undermining his own credibility. This seems a prime example of wilful ignorance. It is true that the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME, but it comes awfully close. It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama.
1777;20134;big bank;1;2;to be a good person get rid of drugs citizen something;the intention of this tweet is to criticize the war on drugs, arguing it causes more harm than good, while expressing a neutral stance on the legality of marijuana and alcohol consumption.;All it does is promote violence and enrich big time drug dealers;. Do alcohol and marijuana affect some users negatively? Absolutely. Should minors be allowed to legally consume either one? No. But the war on drugs is a failure. All it does is promote violence and enrich big time drug dealers and the utterly corrupt interdiction apparatus both in the U.S. and abroad. I don't endorse the use of either marijuana or alcohol. But making them illegal protects no one.
1778;3716;teacher;1;1;to get a better job new out of school be good teacher;criticize the tfa program's design feature of attrition and its negative impact on teachers and students.;An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years;Many TFA folks are feeling defensive these days, and rightly so. The program promises more than it can deliver. It is not the fault of these idealistic and/or ambitious young people that the program has been overly touted as the silver bullet for all education's problems. There is nothing wrong with leaving education after two years, becoming an administrator or going to law school. The problem is that attrition is basically a design feature of the program. An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns. There needs to be an overhaul if the public is to be expected to continue supporting a program that is not successful in helping create long term stability in schools.

It's too risky.;We can not allow the refugees into Western countries. It's too risky. Any political leader who supports Syrian refugees coming into the U.S. should resign their position immediately if one of those refugee commits any act of violence in our country.
1780;16379;drug;1;0;to stay away from drugs be a good person citizen alcohol not get in trouble;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drug' is to criticize the prescription of certain drugs by doctors and the negative impact it has on society.;Marijuana, like alcohol, can be used too frequently, or used at times when;The real gateway drugs are prescribed by doctors. Those are dangerous and we are seeing the fallout from increased heroin addiction and overdose death. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be used too frequently, or used at times when we need to be sober, like during work or before operating a vehicle. And children most definitely should not partake. Alcohol can be just as dangerous as any drug. Even though the majority of citizens do not abuse alcohol, there are some among us who simply cannot drink responsibly. There will be some who cannot use marijuana responsibly either, but I don't think policy should be written for those who abuse a substance. That is not effective policy.
1781;4628;israel;1;1;to be a leader loyal independent respected;the intention of the tweet is to express support for israel and its values.;Our strength is in our relationship with Israel. We stand true to OUR values. We are;Our strength is in our relationship with Israel. We stand true to OUR values. We are right because Israel is right and a true friend doesn't bend with the conventional will but stands loyal in the face of intense pressure. Israel is and always will be a democracy , seeking peace in a part of the world where terror, brutal dictators and repression and distortion are a way of life. . Name one arab country where a woman could lead it's government, name one arab country with a free press and name one country that doesn't have at least one major arty dominated by a well known terrorist group...As an American I wear my loyalty to our democratic ally with pride.
1782;9245;drilling;1;0;to save the planet environment world earth money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drilling' is to criticize it as not being the answer to the energy needs and environmental problems.;Drilling for oil off the coast is not the answer;Look at the record snowfall in Boston and its economic consequences. Look at the record cold coming up in Raleigh. Look at the devastating consequences of the drought in California. Look at what is happening in Sao Paulo in Brazil. We must get off fossil fuels and we must do it as soon as we can. Drilling for oil off the coast is not the answer. More solar, wind and conservation are the answer. We need to wake up before it is too late for the future of this planet. Our kids are counting on us to do the right thing.
1783;16184;terrorism;1;0;to be a good friend get better deal person citizen;the intention of the tweet is to question the us's policy towards terrorism and its inconsistency in establishing relations with cuba.;convicted terrorist who blew up a Cuban Airliner killing 37 innocent people;Can Mr. Montaner explain why the USA aided and sheltered Luis Pasada, a convicted terrorist who blew up a Cuban Airliner killing 37 innocent people? I find it incredible that we trade freely with Vietnam and China, two communist nations, but for some reason the US cannot establish relations with Cuba?
1784;16354;legal immigrants;1;1;to be a part of something good citizen person not racist;the intention of the tweet towards legal immigrants is to argue that legal immigration and illegal immigration are separate issues and that legal immigration can be positive without illegal immigration.;Legal immigration is not the issue. Illegal immigration is the issue;Legal immigration is not the issue. Illegal immigration is the issue. Arguing that legal immigration and illegal immigration together sometimes produce positive results is irrational. We can have legal immigration without illegal immigration. The truth is that students whose families immigrate legally from Europe, Asia and Africa-but not Latin America-to the United States are more likely to graduate from high school than native-born students while students whose families immigrate illegally are far more likely to drop out than native-born students.
1785;10145;electric cars;1;0;to save money money. make a profit be leader;the author's intention towards electric cars is that they are not likely to become mainstream in the us in the next five years due to the high cost of li ion batteries, but the long-term outlook is more favorable if the cost can be significantly reduced.;I see all electric vehicles as being niche vehicles in the US for the next decade or so;"""If they can get the price point below $15k, they'll sell 50 million of them"" Not likely with Li ion batteries anytime within the next five years. The battery pack alone is estimated to cost $15K for all electric vehicles. But, look what happened with computing power over the last 30 years. I see all electric vehicles as being niche vehicles in the US for the next decade or so. Long term is more favorable if the cost of the battery pack can be lowered by a factor of 10."
1786;14729;college;1;1;to be a part of something women able attend good person woman;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the preservation of highly selective women's colleges, while also allowing for choice and the ability to enroll in courses at nearby co-ed universities.;the best such as Wellesley should survive;"Whatever the fate of the majority of women's colleges, the best such as Wellesley should survive. Why not have choice. I am unaware of any remaining, highly selective men's colleges, but choice should be preserved for women, especially if they can enroll in courses at nearby co-ed universities that are equally selective. Perhaps among the little Ivies, one or two should have remained all male. I went to a university that from the outset was to be co-ed (ok it took a few years while it raised money for a women's dorm). More than a few of my female contemporaries went on to excel in medical schools, law schools, and graduate school. I never noticed, however, any particular women's point of view in class; just excellence."
1787;21591;family owned business;1;2;to be helpful help others people;the intention of this tweet appears to be defending mother teresa's work and criticizing those who disagree with her priorities, while also expressing nostalgia and appreciation for mother teresa's impact on kolkata in the 80s.;It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you';Shame on you. It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you're sitting on your... laurels. I grew up in Kolkata in the 80s. Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the slums in the central and northern parts of the city. More importantly, she drew attention to the plight of the homeless and dying in the city. I get that this makes some Bengali intellectuals, such as Aroup Chatterjee, uncomfortable. So what? So her priorities didn't agree with yours. Since when did your priorities become the yardstick for sainthood?
1788;8798;federal model;1;1;to be a good leader make the program better teacher improve;criticize the current federal model of head start program.;The current loosely administered federal model is not working well;Head Start can evolve into a high quality early childhood education program but the first step involves transferring the administration of the program to the states along with performance standards. The current loosely administered federal model is not working well.
1789;3441;a problem;1;0;to protect his country be a leader safe free;the intention of the tweet is to assert that illegal immigration is the problem and that the author believes the country needs protected borders.;Immigration is not, nor has never been a problem for us. ILLEGAL;One more time, with feeling!!!! Immigration is not, nor has never been a problem for us. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION is the problem! If we are a sovereign Nation we need protected borders! What don't some bleeding heart Liberals understand about this!!
1790;17591;dictator;1;0;to be in control power a leader free;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the author's government for its actions towards cuba, while also suggesting that other countries, such as pakistan, should be targeted instead.;Embolden the world's dictators? They don't seem to care one;Embolden the world's dictators? They don't seem to care one way of the other. China will continue its its one party state regardless of what happens with Cuba. So will the Saudis. So will Putin. Cuba is a small issue in a big world. but in a nation that prides itself on personal freedom, it is bizarre to restrict my personal right to trade or travel unless we are at or near a state of war - or have a similar national security concern. With Cuba we have no such concern. And unlike many other places in the world, Cubans don't have a knee jerk hatred of us. (So let's instead stop trade with Pakistan!)
1791;13390;college students;1;1;to get a job degree make money be understood;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the stereotype of college students as unreliable and to highlight their struggles and hardships.;They are not your unreliables. Just watch them.;Oh, of course you're thinking of the college students of the elite. Where do most college students live? In dorms? Look it up. They live with their parents or they scrabble to make ends meet in shared apartments. They work. And they are angry and tired in their twenties. And in debt. They are not your unreliables. Just watch them.
1792;20764;number;1;2;to be selfish selfish. self sufficient have a child;the intention of the tweet is to express opposition to a proposed tax break for not having children in any school.;this proposal is nasty and mean spirited;As soon as I get my tax break for never having had a child in any school - public, private, home or otherwise. To be clear, this proposal is nasty and mean spirited - are we so self-centered now that we do we do not want to contribute to anthing of collective benefit to society?
1793;16016;rental companys;1;1;to be a good citizen neighbor person friend fair;the intention of the tweet towards rental companies is to argue that they should not be responsible for changing rental-car oil as it is their contractual responsibility.;people don't change rental-car oil because that is the contractual responsibility of the rental company;Allowing maximum access does not cause maximum use. It distributes use over a broader set of beaches, actually reducing crowding. Further, people don't change rental-car oil because that is the contractual responsibility of the rental company. It is not akin to a commons. The shore is a commons and the public has both the right to enjoy it and he responsibility to protect it.
1794;3923;the status of public teachers;1;0;to help the poor make a difference be leader point helpful;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the importance of tfa alumni in changing the political debate over public education and their impact on public policy and politics.;TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children;One of the most important contributions to US education from TFA alumni has not been mentioned by any of the contributors to this discussion. The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics.
1795;2095;sports raising costs;1;0;to make money. a profit money be leader;the intention of the tweet is to suggest a solution to the high costs of intercollegiate sports by spinning off the profit-makers as university-owned semipro operations.;When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between;"I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: ""Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports."" I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that ""there is no going back."" How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody."
1796;17156;prostitution;1;1;to make money money. have sex be free;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for legalizing prostitution to improve the safety and well-being of workers.;Legal or illegal, prostitution will continue;Legal or illegal, prostitution will continue. This is evident around the world. Sex is a basic inherent need and prostitution will not go away regardless of the criminal penalties. The only rational approach is to bring it above ground, gain transparency, and enforce safety regulations. These things happen only with legalized prostitution. New Zealand is today a great example of legalized prostitution where workers are well-treated and safe.
1797;14932;taxation practices;1;1;to have a business make living money. money;criticize taxation practices.;We should tax lightly but evenly every inventory turn, personal or corporate;So taxing capital gains is double taxing income? OK so why should a laborer be taxed on his income after the first year of his career? His income is taxed and what's left over, his gain, is reinvested as capital into his service business: food which maintains his strength, housing which provides the location of his enterprise and the sundry other expenses that maintain his life so that his business may continue. Perhaps it might even grow into a larger enterprise, a family with several lines of business. If corporations can be people can people not be businesses? Can it be argued that he does not have a service business? Can it be argued that food is not a necessary input to the continuation of his business? I know these are not traditional perspectives, but I think them equally valid. We should tax lightly but evenly every inventory turn, personal or corporate.
1798;18595;emotion;1;1;to be successful make money get ahead win;the intention of the tweet is to express anger towards the target.;The deep thinker that said tipping is anticapitalistic obviously did not think this through;Bottom line, anyone arguing against tipping is just trying to rationalizes their cheapness. The deep thinker that said tipping is anticapitalistic obviously did not think this through. What is more entrepeneurial then have to suceed or fail solely on your hard work, charm and guile.
1799;2410;refugees;1;0;to protect his country be safe a leader safe.;the intention of the tweet towards target'refugees' is to suggest a solution to the issue of refugees by keeping them in the middle east, closer to their home, rather than allowing them to go to europe.;No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in;The issue is not whether refugees are good people or not -- rather the concern should be that those fleeing war in Syria should not all be going to Europe. A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants. Nations can and should have workable policies on immigration, capable of being followed and enforced. THis is an issue quite separate from that of terrorism, and one that has been a major political issue in the US for decades already.
1800;15092;regulated air travel;1;0;to be in control charge free travel;the intention of the tweet towards regulated air travel is to criticize it.;There is no such thing as a free market in any industry -- least of all the airline;Anyone who says or even thinks that air travel today is superior in any meaningful way to air travel before regulation has no direct knowledge of regulated air travel. - I do. Air travel today is equivalent to bus travel in the sixties. I remember that as well. There is no such thing as a free market in any industry -- least of all the airline industry.
1801;4413;medical care;1;1;to know what do is wrong the truth be informed;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for more time spent by doctors with patients to improve patient comfort and understanding of their history and symptoms.;Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is;I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies.
1802;10458;obestiy;1;0;to get a job the tired;the intention of the tweet towards obesity is to criticize and discriminate against obese individuals in professional settings due to their physical limitations.;Regardless of their intellect or job experience, there was no chance of their being hired;During my career as a college administrator I interviewed my fair share of obese job applicants for professional positions. Regardless of their intellect or job experience, there was no chance of their being hired. Why? Because they couldn't fit in the chairs at the conference table where search committees met. They sat on the edge of chairs and almost fell forward trying to balance, which didn't do much for their concentrating on complex question from faculty members. They were constantly out of breath, and sweating, and struggled to reach for the glass of water set before them. They could barely walk to various sites around campus for a required tour, and in some cases, wouldn't even try. They shuffled down the halls while their fit escorts waited, if not patiently, certainly politely. Faculty and other professional jobs require energy and stamina. No amount of intellect can overcome these kinds of self-induced problems, and discrimination is really irrelevant in such cases when one considers the terrible burden such people impose on employers.
1803;11266;learning languages;1;1;to learn a new language be able communicate understood by others good citizen;the intention of the tweet is to promote the value of learning languages as a life skill for better communication and understanding with multinational contractors and non-english speakers.;It's enabled me to work easily with multinational contractors, to better understand supply chains and logistics;I have a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. According to other comments on this article, I have no use for a foreign language - yet I'm fluent in two and can get by in two more. It's enabled me to work easily with multinational contractors, to better understand supply chains and logistics in Europe because I had to LISTEN more closely when it wasn't presented in English, to be perceived as a good representative of the US - not as someone who insists on English only and someone who pretends that speaking English LOUDER suddenly makes it comprehensible to non-English speakers. Even if a person never achieves fluency, the ability to try to reach across the language gap is invauable as a life skill. I use it quite by accident/coincidence every time I visit New York.
1804;16333;motherhood;1;1;to be a good parent mother have healthy child one child.;the intention of the tweet is to argue that delayed motherhood is reasonable and practical in the modern western world, where children have a high chance of survival and a good standard of living.;delayed motherhood makes perfect sense;In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality.
1805;14084;child;1;1;to be in control charge healthy free;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'child' is to assert the author's belief in the importance of personal choice in determining the lifestyle of their child, regardless of scientific or societal norms.;forcing my daughter to sustain herself on just a cracker and piece of lettuce each day;Don't parents also deserve to have a choice with regards to wether or not they feed their children? Just because science and history have proven that forcing my daughter to sustain herself on just a cracker and piece of lettuce each day, that doesn't mean that I should be deprived of my ability to choose the life my daughter will live so it conforms to my personal beliefs about body image. Maybe god tells me that my daughter is evil if she weighs over 100 lbs, or maybe it's my social circle that believes that a skeletal figure is healthy and beautiful. The point is, it should be MY choice, because that's what freedom is about. And hey, if she isn't strong enough to live with the lifestyle I choose, that's her problem.
1806;258;limiting meat/dairy consumption;1;1;to be healthy healthy. not sick eat meat healthier;the intention of the tweet is to promote limiting meat and dairy consumption for health benefits and ethical reasons.;I really think limited dairy has made a huge change;I quit eating beef over thirty years ago. I quit chicken five years ago, I had allergies my entire life, now, I have none. No stuffy nose or hives. I really think limited dairy has made a huge change. I do eat some, but it really made me sick when I did everyday. A very smart, organized person that enjoys cooking can design a diet without meat that is so heathy. When I saw how animals are raised for food, never seeing the sunshine or grass, shot up with antibiotic and chained to a metal pole (veal), or, dairy calves taken from their mother at birth, I as a mammal, could never accept such cruel behavior again.
1807;11813;farmers not following the law;1;1;to be a good person citizen help the poor make money;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the punishment of farmers who are not following the law and to support the deportation of illegal immigrants.;they are breaking the law and conspiring to break the law for their benefit and the detri;It's nice to know that farmers following the law would have positive economic effects but more importantly, they are breaking the law and conspiring to break the law for their benefit and the detriment of the american worker. Let's focus on puting these crooked farmers in jail and on deporting the illegals. Both hurt the american worker.
1808;17500;minimum wage;1;0;to get a raise make money. be generous money fair;the intention of the tweet towards target'minimum wage' is to argue for higher wages for workers.;I'm on the side of (at least) minimum wage;I'm on the side of (at least) minimum wage. But I want to raise a different issue. Since when do we owe the bakery clerk a tip? The coffee barista? Every place you go up to a counter, place an order, pick it up yourself, clear your own table--has a tip jar. Should we have tip jars for librarians? Grocery checkers? Shoe sales people? The whole thing is insane. People should work for wages, and employers should pay them. If that means the product costs more, we have a choice about consuming/buying it. PS I had my days as a waitress. So has my daughter. I understand that if you're paid no wages, you depend on tips--and I tip in restaurants. But I don't think it's the right system.
1809;2203;curriculum in public schools;1;1;to be educated knowledgeable learn teach;the intention of the tweet is to defend the curriculum in public schools.;I think that teachers should teach what there assinged to teach;I think that teachers should teach what there assinged to teach. Teachers have gone to school for this and this is what they do for a living. So they probably know what they're talking about. If you dont like what teachers are teaching in public schools then you should probably enroll your kid in a private school
1810;359;research papers;1;1;to learn something new get a degree be smart;the intention of the tweet is to defend the value of research papers as a means of developing critical thinking and research skills.;Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this;"""Are research papers a waste of time?"" Absolutely not! The internet may give students and scholars easy access to sources, but many of these sources are flawed or unreliable in some way. Now more than ever, students need to know how to sift through information to find reliable sources and well-constructed arguments. Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this. Select a paper topic that you find interesting or important. Read and evaluate 10-15 reputable sources related to your topic, and then build an argument that engages with and contributes to this existing research. This might not be the most exciting assignment in the world (depends on the topic, I suppose) but it teaches skills that every college graduate should have. Really, every high school graduate ought to have this training as well. But let's not ask for the moon!"
1811;4087;advice about eating well;1;1;to be healthy healthy. healthier live longer;the intention of the tweet is to express concern about the lack of education on healthy eating and lifestyle habits, and the negative influence of the agriculture/food industry and medical community on promoting health.;Many people are uninformed about diet and lifestyle to promote optimum health;Many people are uninformed about diet and lifestyle to promote optimum health. Less is being taught students of today than was taught when I was in school (in the 40's and 50's). The agriculture/food industry and the medical community have been promoting the values of greed rather than health. Our car culture has taken the most healthful exercise from many of us -- walking.
1812;859;marijuana legalization;1;0;to get rid of something it prove a point make people be safe;the author's intention towards marijuana legalization is to express concern about the potential long-term damage to society and public health from widespread use, and to argue that time will show the harmful results of these rushes to legalization.;I believe we'll see long-term damage to society and public health from widespread use;"A lot of folks have their head in the sand re pot usage. I believe we'll see long-term damage to society and public health from widespread use. Just as tobacco studies took years to prove cancer correlation, I believe time will show the harmful results of these rushes to legalization. The deniers will continue to push the same arguments: prohibition is bad; there's no proof of ill effects, etc., etc., but truth will prevail and be validated by time passing."
1813;17484;cherry-picking students;1;0;to be in control charge a leader power;the intention of the tweet towards target 'cherry-picking students' is to criticize the practice of holding back students based on their behavior, as it encourages others to conform to strict rules and thought control.;I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female;As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student. If this is Educational theory, we are in deep trouble
1814;14828;drug use;1;0;to be healthy lose weight healthier feel better;the intention of the tweet is to refute the idea that pot is a gateway drug and to assert that the author has not let any drug control their life.;If pot was a gateway drug, I would have been dead from an overdose 20 years;If pot was a gateway drug, I would have been dead from an overdose 20 years ago. My friends make fun of what a lightweight drinker I am. My New Year's resolution this year was to drink a glass of red wine daily for health purposes. I failed within a week. Don't get me wrong - I am a product of my generation. I've done cocaine (really didn't like) pharmaceuticals (hate) and LSD (loved and hope I get another chance before I die). But none of those things, including pot, has taken control of my life. Sorry, you're wrong.
1815;5834;bias;1;0;to make a point be heard. bully heard understood;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the bias of the new york times and washington post.;The New York Times often reinforces its editorial biases by carefully editing out comments from readers;The New York Times often reinforces its editorial biases by carefully editing out comments from readers who do not agree with them. Its comments sections are thus made into a propaganda device, adding force to the paper's views. The comment from readers of the Washington Post are too often degraded by the inclusion of personal attacks upon other posters.The glue--rubber form of discourse.
1816;21193;bachelor 's degree;1;2;to make money. be successful money happy;the user is expressing a nuanced view on tipping, acknowledging its role in creating a positive dining experience while questioning its underlying reasons, and respecting those who thrive in that system.;I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found;Actually Len is both right and wrong. Right in that tipping creates the environment we enjoy when we go out, but wrong in why it does. The people who seek and do well at jobs paid mainly via tips live in that world and it is a world they are competent and appreciated in. To so drastically change that world by eliminating the immediacy of the action and the reward would appeal to a completely different type of person. I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found pleasure in it. But I respect those that do and enjoy both the experience of being served well and the pleasure of tipping graciously.
1817;5278;mother teresa;1;0;to be a good person get rid of something better make point;the user expresses criticism and disappointment towards the catholic church's swift canonization of mother teresa, finding it historically inaccurate and her fame undeserved.;The bizarre and totally ahistorical rush to canonize Mother Teresa is one of the;The bizarre and totally ahistorical rush to canonize Mother Teresa is one of the more embarrassing episodes in the Catholic Church's recent history. (One of. There are lots.) The fact that her fame and reputation don't hold up under a light breeze makes it even more disgraceful.
1818;14518;california education policy;1;1;to get a better education good job degree;criticize;This doesn't seem like a wise education policy;The UC system was envisioned in the 1960's to admit 13% of California high school students. Today, in practice, approximately 9% are admitted. Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy. The State of California ends up with a large number of students who are less educated, have higher debt rates, or leave the state permanently.
1819;1994;language;1;1;to learn something new things languages be educated;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of learning multiple languages to understand different cultures and perspectives.;learning another language gives you the ability to understand how other people on the planet think;When I was in high school I had to study Latin for two years and I had to study a modern language. I chose German. Later in college I continued my studies in German and took up Russian. As an older adult I took courses in Modern Irish and Old Irish. Now, as a septuagenarian, I am studying Brazilian Portuguese. Why? because learning another language gives you the ability to understand how other people on the planet think. Yes, Cassandra, you need to learn how to think but you also need to understand how other peoples think in order to be a citizen of this world.

After taking Jeffrey Sachs' and Peter Singer's courses online via Coursera for free, it is abundantly clear to me that from the perspectives of economic development, sustainability and ethics all that Mr. Nair concludes is true. Problem is whether it is simply human nature which will prevent us from overcoming our collective addictions to ego and hedonism, and that balance with humility is an ephemeral conceit.
1821;3055;republican hypocrisy regarding immigration;1;1;to help the poor get a job make money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the republican party for their hypocrisy regarding immigration.;OUR GOVERNMENT USING AND ABUSING THESE PEOPLE,;This situation has existed for decades. The Illegal immigrants have provided needed labor in many areas of our country. They for the most part are industrious, hardworking, friendly and religious people. Stopping the flow of illegal immigrants could have happened decades ago by making it a crime punishable by fine or jail for anyone to hire an undocumented, illegal immigrant. For decades despite all of the talk, our government has given a nod and a wink for them to come here. They have raised their families here and have been a net positive to our society. WHAT SHOULLD BE ILLEGAL IS OUR GOVERNMENT USING AND ABUSING THESE PEOPLE, THEN BEATING THEM OVER THE HEAD SAYING THEY SHOULD BE DEPORTED ENMASS. Shame on the Republican party. Where is their conscious? What are their religious beliefS???????

I say, ""Fight back. Blow him up."" When they are willing to call off their shoe bombers and underwear bombers and others trying to blow up my airplane or hijack it and fly it into a building, then I will oppose trying to take out their leaders with drones. While that group of thugs is trying to kill us at home and killing us abroad, I am for taking out their leaders."

Moderate rebels? Seriously? Just because the Rebels opposing the Syrian Democratic Forces are backed by Turkey does that make them moderate? The Kurdish led coalition with Arabs and Syriac-Assyrians want to create a secular democracy within the borders of an autonomous region in a land otherwise ruled by terror. Is that such a bad thing? The whole point of war is to seize territory from those that are trying to kill you. Always has been all ways will. Two years ago the Kurds were almost pushed outside the borders of Syria and faced genocide, they will not let that happen again. I see you are a writer for Ak am Dail which is a Turk Government publication. I was going to take this piece seriously but I think your credentials speak for themselves.

This is a case of the tail wagging the dog. When we pander to threats of violence, in the long run we get more violence. The United States is the most powerful country in the world and used to be a moral force. It should do the right thing.
1825;11009;support for librarians;1;1;to be informed a leader helpful knowledgeable;support for librarians.;Easy access to relevant and accurate information is a cornerstone in our democracy;Easy access to relevant and accurate information is a cornerstone in our democracy. How can we not have specialists (aka librarians) who find, catalog, index, and protect the information used by all of us? We all frequently rely on specialists - medical, technical, financial, etc. - for the best information and advice. In this exploding universe of digital information, let's encourage our academic and governmental decision makers to fully realize the critical and specialized value that librarians provide to patrons of all ages.
1826;6355;public lands;1;0;to be a good citizen neighbor person the public safe respectful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'public lands' is to protect and preserve public access rights.;we must not let money dictate access;From the Ocean State, with a few beaches here of our own, and laws protecting rights of way to the shoreline dating back to colonial times, we must not let money dictate access. I see obscene sums of money thrown at efforts to overthrow ancient public access rights. Every rich out of towner shows up, buys property that has allowed public access of one kind or another for centuries, and then does their damnedest to change the rules. Hey pal, you're a smart guy, you knew what you were buying! On the other hand, I think members of the public should respect the adjacent property owners by keeping litter, noise and nuisance to a minimum. The only thing that I know that can close a beach to access here is piping plovers hatching.
1827;9136;government pay and benefits;1;1;to get a better job good have life make more money.;critical of government pay and benefits.;those with advanced degrees and good skill sets get much better pay and benefits in private industry;Concur wholeheartedly with much of the article. The fact is, those with advanced degrees and good skill sets get much better pay and benefits in private industry and leave government on a regular basis (contrary to many of those who claim government employment compensation and benefits are better). In my own case, the private salary I was offered was 3 x the salary in government and had better benefits as well. The problems at the top are large but we never hear that from the smaller government proponents.

Nestle makes the obesity epidemic sound like it is a matter of people simply eating too many calories. It is too many carbs, and in particular refined sugars. Also, fruit isn't that great--go w/veggies. These are all terrible contributors to the problem of obesity.
1829;9463;id cards;1;1;to help the poor be helpful people;the intention of the tweet towards target 'id cards' is to use them as a tool for identifying and deporting undocumented immigrants.;First identify all the people who have ignored the immigration laws of the US and then quietly deport;I agree it will be a useful tool, to deport them. First identify all the people who have ignored the immigration laws of the US and then quietly deport them so they can be reunited with their families back in their country of origin.
1830;20306;vaccination;1;2;to be healthy healthy. not addicted sick stay;the intention of this tweet is to humorously downplay the gateway drug concept for marijuana, instead emphasizing how it led to unhealthy eating habits, and to highlight the serious issue of poverty, hopelessness, and lack of education as gateways to opioid abuse.;I smoked a fair amount of weed in my early 20's, and then;Marijuana is a gateway drug for frequent use of pizza delivery and the steady consumption of Fritos, Ben & Jerry's, and other junk food. That's about it. I smoked a fair amount of weed in my early 20's, and then the desire just naturally tapered off as I became more involved in professional pursuits. Now that I'm retired, I probably wouldn't buy it even if I could pick it up in the produce section of my local grocery store. Why? Frequent use of pizza delivery, Fritos, Ben & Jerry's...I don't need the help gaining weight and sitting around on my rear end, thank you. Want to know what's a gateway drug for opioid abuse? The combination of poverty, hopelessness and lack of education.

Religious freedom is not an unqualified right, and public health must trump a parent's objections to vaccination based on religious grounds. Besides, the parents are putting the risk of disease on the child, not themselves. This is child abuse, in my opinion.

Don't attack the $30 billion of overdraft fees, without finding an alternative revenue source for banks. Don't attack banks for competing with expensive payday loan and check cashing storefronts."" Why not? You give me no reasons for any of this - am I supposed to be convinced just because you say so? I think the other commenters here have done a good job of taking down your straw man argument about overhead costs....."
1833;21477;oil dependence;1;2;to help others be helpful people;the intention of the tweet towards target 'oil dependence' is to express optimism that a viable substitute for opioid use to treat pain will become well known and received as a blessing, potentially leading to a shift away from oil dependence.;MJ's viable substitute for opioid use to treat pain;Exactly, right on target. I do believe this view will become more prevalent as we go along. In particular, MJ's viable substitute for opioid use to treat pain will probably become well known and received as a blessing. The table is turning right now. Let's see how it plays out.
1834;1468;involved politics;1;2;to be in charge power a judge control;the intention of the tweet is to argue that politics is involved in the judiciary.;Why would anyone think that judges are kept out of politics? On many state or country levels they;Why would anyone think that judges are kept out of politics? On many state or country levels they are flat-out elected. The ones who are appointed are often on the receiving end of political reward. Even Federal appointments are political footballs these days, note wellhow many of Obama's picks have been hung out to dry. The grilling that any SCOTUS nom gets is patently political, too - note well McConnell saying that any SCOTUS judge has to pass approval of the NRA. It is imaginary to think that politics are not involved with the judiciary.
1835;20070;state citizenship;1;2;to be healthy healthy. avoid getting sick healthier;the author's intention is to emphasize the individuality of dietary needs and health, drawing from their personal experiences, and discourage telling others what to eat based on personal beliefs.;I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many;I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.
1836;394;minor violations;1;0;to be safe helpful save lives help people;the intention of the tweet is to argue that broken windows policing is effective at preventing minor violations and contributing to a livable environment.;broken windows policing effective at preventing minor crime;Not only is broken windows policing effective at preventing minor crime, and doing so at far less cost and risk and with lesser punishments, but it contributes strongly to the quality of life, and that shouldn't be underestimated. A boom car isn't as serious as a drive-by killing, but try getting work done on Saturday afternoon when the guy across the street is driving one. We need to prevent major crimes, but we also need to maintain a livable, civil environment in which to live our everyday lives.
1837;2461;cuba;1;0;to be a leader in control make point charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'cuba' is to criticize the united states' judgment of cuba's human rights record and to argue that the us is in no position to evaluate it due to its own dismal human rights record.;It is an act of imperial hubris for the United States to judge Cuba's;"Ted Henken rightly refers to Cuba's ""dismal human rights record,"" but neglects to acknowledge that the United States is in no position to evaluate it. It is an act of imperial hubris for the United States to judge Cuba's human rights record, and in order for us to take such a judgment seriously we would have to ignore the dismal human rights record of the United States and the massive heap of corpses that US foreign policy is responsible for. The purpose of the embargo, of course, was to ""cause hunger, desperation and the overthrow of the Government,"" and as such is a far greater crime than any Cuba has committed under the despicable Castro regime."
1838;6320;carbon waste;1;0;to be a good person get rid of something it citizen;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the increase in carbon footprint is not the root cause of the problem, but rather the excess of feet producing footprints.;carbon footprint is a binary problem;carbon footprint is a binary problem. But, most basically, the excess of carbon is a direct factor of the increase of feet producing footprints. Carbon is not intrinsically the problem. But a geometric excess of feet is. In 1800, 1 billion on the Earth. 1963, 2.2 billion. 20i5, 7 billion, 2030, ???? Does the world unsustainable seem apt?

English is the language of our country.), the crime and the continuing ghettoization of cities (albeit just another sign of the failure of multiculturalism) and most folks would be happy to pay more at the greengrocer for US citizen-picked produce. The mantra of 'jobs Americans don't want' leaves out the 'at that pay' aspect.

I'm all for it. I'm also all for people making a decision and living by it. No public school?

As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, ""People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry"" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which ""has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the ""Least Restrictive Environment"" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted ""inclusion is illusion,"" that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA."
1842;2199;immigration;1;0;to be a good citizen they want safe have better life person;the intention of the tweet towards target 'immigration' is to express support for a controlled immigration process with appropriate background checks.;Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders;First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either.

My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII."

As long as I can remember, this elite liberal arts college in Oregon has advertised its non-participation in intercollegiate athletics, offering only intramural sports. Theirs, I believe, is an ideological choice (and one with which I agree). I believe that sports has no place in schools and even less of a place in universities. Make sports part of the community, as is done in places such as Germany.

Whats worse, to my thinking is that people I know well enough to ask aren't that interested that someone else does. That disinterest, as far as I can see, represents an attitude less of ambivalence, than the far more worrisome kind...resignation. As any investment, compared to any other investment, will likely reflect as much on means as intentions, it might serve to consider that a tax policy that fosters, for lack of a better word ...hording ..might just run counter to the thinking of those of us who think that economic development and refinement are to be preferred to, perhaps...oh... atavism.

A writer and an art director (in the old world) are paired together to come up with creative ideas that neither might arrive at alone. It's an awkward dance between two minds. You have to make a fool of yourself, try out all the bad ideas first, give criticism, accept it. At times it means shouting, singing, cursing, ranting, and speaking every bawdy, politically-incorrect idea that crosses your mind. The process can not be done in public, in an open work area. It's too embarrassing. It involves trust in the person you're collaborating with not to repeat every stupid thing you uttered on the hard road to a good idea. An office needs to be designed based on the kind of work people are doing. Pity to anyone who needs to work on the phone in an open plan.
1853;15462;politicians;1;0;to be a leader in charge power control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'politicians' is to criticize their focus on special interests and core constituents, and their tendency to ignore or dismiss concerns that do not relate to them.;They really feel that the day to day concerns of people who they formally represent but really do;Activists run for elected office and are elected frequently, and they advocate for their causes just like every politician advocates for something. They usually accomplish their purposes and sometimes what they introduce actually remains after they leave office. As public servants they tend to be focused upon their core constituents and their core issues and tend to trivialize the concerns which do not relate to them. They really feel that the day to day concerns of people who they formally represent but really do not wish to bother worrying about do not matter or can be ignored as they follow their passions. One of the reasons that so many people feel alienated by politicians is the way local politicians are preoccupied with causes and special interests.

If she had thoroughly done her research, she would have realized those of us who competed in pageants (My first pageant was at 17, and then not again until age 25) were and continue to be in the driver's seat as it relates to achieving the goals for our lives. I had a plan in place when I was competing, which has evolved and continues today in every aspect of my life. As Miss Maine 1990, competing at the local, state levels and then at Miss America opened the door to many opportunities. Never was I made to feel my success was a result of participation in a ""moneymaking machine"". As for ""female insecurity"", every person during their lifetime - male or female experiences insecurity - whether it be at five, 25 or 75 years old...you cannot tell me the author has not experienced this in some type of setting.

Adults are required to attend a polling station, to produce identification, and to have their name crossed off the electoral roll. They are then handed voting slips but there is no requirement to fill them out or submit them, or to submit a valid vote. This system ensures that no-one is forced to vote if they do not wish to, but also ensures that the barriers to participation are removed. It embodies the Australian ethos of ""a fair go for all"". Sadly I don't think the system used here in the USA is worthy of its citizens."

However, as a Brit I think the photo and Bachman's gesture probably sums up her attitude towards US democracy, but that is due to my retaining my British cultural roots.

Like Ioannidis said we have an epidemic of opinions in medicine today. Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids. It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license. So we should try to reeducate doctors in both using opioids and in pain care- its morally right and there is evidence that it can improve care.
1859;5727;statistic;1;0;to make a point understand the situation problem something;the intention of the tweet towards target'statistic' is to argue that statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models, are not inherently good or bad, and that they are acceptable for predictive accuracy in both medical and criminality studies.;Statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models are not inherently good or bad;Analogies are a weak form of argument, but the parallels in predicting medical outcomes and those used to predict criminality are inherently the same. In both instances the goal is predictive accuracy. Statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models are not inherently good or bad. A researcher may think that if one can predict medical or sociological outcomes, then one understands them, but that is not the case. Statistical correlation may not demonstrate causality, but it directs our attention to possible causal factors--such as the link between smoking and cancer. Thus the use of probability models in criminality studies is heuristic and acceptable. First, demonstrate a statistical association, and then try to identify and construct a causal model.
1860;19959;military intervention middle east;1;2;to make a point be creative understood show off;the intention of this tweet is to emphasize the importance of privacy and trust in a collaborative workplace, particularly for creative professionals in advertising, and to critique open-plan offices.;pity to anyone who needs to work on the phone in an open plan;I'm in advertising. A writer and an art director (in the old world) are paired together to come up with creative ideas that neither might arrive at alone. It's an awkward dance between two minds. You have to make a fool of yourself, try out all the bad ideas first, give criticism, accept it. At times it means shouting, singing, cursing, ranting, and speaking every bawdy, politically-incorrect idea that crosses your mind. The process can not be done in public, in an open work area. It's too embarrassing. It involves trust in the person you're collaborating with not to repeat every stupid thing you uttered on the hard road to a good idea. An office needs to be designed based on the kind of work people are doing. Pity to anyone who needs to work on the phone in an open plan.
1861;16220;criminal;1;0;to be a good citizen person keep criminals in jail prison power;the intention of the tweet towards target 'criminal' is to deny voting rights to criminals who have been convicted of breaking the law.;Criminals should not be allowed to vote;Criminals should not be allowed to vote. They have no business electing people who make the laws once they have been convicted of breaking the law. Perhaps, if a released offender has gone 5 years without convicting another crime then his voting rights can be restored. But to restore voting rights to newly released convicts is crazy since a fairly high percentage of these people will end up back in prison anyway. We are better off keeping them in jail for longer time periods instead of letting them out to vote.
1862;16088;admission;1;0;to be the best a leader inclusive fair successful;"the intention of the tweet is to argue that the ""top 10% plan"" is a better admission system than the old one based on race and ethnicity, as it allows low-income white students to get admission letters.";"The Texas ""Top 10% Plan, which guarantees admission to any student who finishes in the top 10""";"The Texas ""Top 10% Plan, which guarantees admission to any student who finishes in the top 10 of his or her graduation class, works best.

Now that the 10% rule in in effect, Hispanic students from the barrio schools are, for the first time, getting acceptance letters. The income-based plan won't work because low-income white students academically outperform low- and lower-middle income Hispanic students."

If I had to too much coursework this way, shoot me! I do a lot of repetitive exercises and am the mercy of the computer when it comes to grading. Computers often have one answer they're set up to screen for--forget possible alternatives. If I have a question, I have to email and wait for an answer. Plus, I get bored sitting in front of a screen. Then again, I'm not from the generation who willingly sits for hours playing video games. Give me a human teacher anytime!

School is for learning, not for creating a schedule that will allow children to have more time for after-school sports practice (how many kids actually become successful athletes anyway?). Not to mention, a longer school day should mean less homework, resulting in a more rejuvenating downtime or creative period (by choice!) for these already-overscheduled kids. Is anyone listening out there?
1865;10076;sexual abuse;1;0;to be in control make a point money. money;the author intends to argue that legalizing prostitution will not prevent prior abuse of women and children, and that abuse is the real problem, not commercial sex.;The problem of abuse came before the activity of prostitution. Abuse leads to prostitution,;"""Numerous studies show that between 70 percent and 90 percent of children and women who end up in commercial sex were sexually abused prior to entry."" The author seems to imply that if there were no sex workers, all of these people would not have suffered abuse. The problem of abuse came before the activity of prostitution. Abuse leads to prostitution, not the other way around. Banning prostitution will do nothing to prevent abuse, and abuse is the real problem, not commercial sex. I see no valid argument that legalizing prostitution would prevent prior abuse of women and children. It could be bettered argued that if there were legal outlets for sexual urges, cases of abuse would decline."

When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network.
1867;20387;woman;1;2;to get rid of competition employees be in control charge;the intention of this tweet is to argue that non-compete clauses in small businesses are typically used to prevent salespeople from leaving to work for competitors, rather than protecting high-cost, proprietary products.;Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try;I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains.

The Palestinian People should pursue their dream and free themselves of American influence. America has historically misled Muslims of the Middle East in Favour of Israel. America sees no wrong in lying to the Muslims of the Middle East by allowing Israel to have the Atomic Bombs - Weapon of Mass destruction. If it were not for American Dollars, American Intelligence and American Manipulation the State of Israel would be history.

The point of a criminal sentence is to deny criminals, for a period, the rights and freedoms of a citizen. But once someone is released from prison, surely they should have a chance to reintegrate. Haven't they paid their debt? To say to someone who stole a car at 17 that they can NEVER again be a full citizen is completely unjust.

FREE;When a hurricane hits and the beaches are damaged, it is the tax payer who pays to have the beaches restored. Why do beach house owners believe they can cut off access to a beach when it is the tax payers who pay to maintain it? If they refuse to allow access to the beach, and the local police departments ticket & tow cars parked on the street owned by out of towners using the beach, then the government should exercise eminent domain, kick the owners to the curb and raze the houses. The beach and the ocean belong to everyone, and everyone should have full and free access. FREE access. Don't get me started on towns that have the nerve to charge a fee to allow people the privilege of sticking their toes in the sand. That is absurd, too.
1871;13748;us army;1;1;to get a job better at it something;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'us army' is to criticize the treatment of labor workers during the 1960s in california, particularly the difficulty faced by white workers in finding employment due to discrimination.;i did field work for three years in the early 60s during my teens;i don't know about the situation in vermont, but in california where i did field work for three years in the early 60s during my teens, out of thirty labor workers, the ones hoeing and moving sprinklers, there were only two of us were american citizens. in fact, it was difficult for me to get hired because i was too white for farm work, the black foreman, Art Davis said, and I wouldn't last.

By 10 a.m. everyone of them were gone when the temperature hit 110. the la times just did a series on georgia problems. even the convicts refused to work in the fields. it takes a week to get used. every muscle and bone in your body hurts, and, like any training it gets worse over three or four days before you acclimate to the regimen. us army 1969-1971/california jd

I understand the VW situation was an example of incompetent policing or enforcement. The problem was not the standards did not allow unsafe air, it was incompetent or ineffective enforcement. I have heard that same is true with Guns laws, in Chicago, mainly that they are strict but not well enforced. We similarly have laws against illegal immigration that are not, in my opinion, faithfully executed. Part of the rule of law is not simply having laws and regulations, but effectively enforcing them. Shame on VW for violating emission requirements, and shame of those who develop that testing standards for not catching this. Why don't they do more extensive emission tests separate from individual car inspections so this type of thing does not get missed.

From this essay, ""Life-threatening emergencies that are not predictable are extremely rare - although they do occur both at home and in the hospital at roughly equal rates."" So when a life-threatening emergency occurs at a hospital, the mother and baby have a pretty good chance of surviving it, or as good as possible anyway. When such occurs at home, the odds are good that the mother and/or baby will die. So home births are less safe. They're usually safe, sure, because these emergencies are rare. But they're less safe than hospitals and always will be."

I am now 63, with 3 degrees from an ivy league school, and having run my own business for over 30 years and having had 100s of employees. I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep. Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally. Public schools shouldn't begin before 9:00 am. Period. Then we'll have better performing students and workers. Guaranteed. And don't tell

He seems to have a problem with no-show reservations made through an online reservation service that costs him money. It seems to me that he is missing the concept that having his restaurant appear online, either on Resy or Opentable, amounts to advertising to the general public. On Resy, it is the customers, not him, who pays for the advertising. He seems to be heading toward the idea of making his restaurants more like dinner clubs for regular diners, and also VIPs, whoever they are. (Maybe he means the VIPs are the people who pay for a reservation.) Well, good luck with that. At the restaurants I like it seems they treat everyone who walks in the the door as a friend or a VIP, even when they apologize and put you on a waiting list to be seated.

Western countries welcome legal immigrants based on our tolerance of other religions and cultures. It is ironic that France has accepted countless numbers of Moslems from North Africa and the Mid- East, some of whom turn out, themselves, to be intolerant. No matter what immigrants' backgrounds are, they have to understand that the reason they have been allowed into their host country, in the first place, is that it is tolerant, and that it expects them to be so, too. This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.) Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave. This should include community leaders and anyone who tries to teach/ preach intolerance to others.

All that I have learned from interacting with them supports Matthew Hertenstein's thoughts here. Touch conveys SO much.

I have had to learn (and am still learning) to speak their language, and in the process have come to understand and appreciate deeply what Matthew Hertenstein means when he says that, ""Some people need other humans more than they think.""

Why should home-schoolers be treated any differently? How will this prevent a bunch of families from having children, giving them the bare minimum of education at home to pass the tests (if testing is implemented), and then receiving a big check in the mail from state? How is this any different from welfare?

In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one.

As a childless person, it;I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it.

But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a ""modern marvel"" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza?"

It buys great medical care, great dental care and great dinners. I come from the land of Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon and I can see myself buying a table at the last minute but if I don't care when I eat there then I will simply wait for an OpenTable or call. But then again our restaurants tend to be on the smaller size more petite size. Sometimes it take being a Chef to get into some of them.

But another employee mentioned that she has no experience and has no way to get a job. So what is the point of even educating oneself if employers require someone strait out of school to have to have relevant experience that they weren't qualified to obtain before they got their degree. It's like the catch-22 from hell.

The family is wealthy enough to do so; the segment of the British public that disapproves of the royals might have a favorable response. BTW - as I understand it, while the British government provides support for the family's state functions, the family provides for their own personal needs out of the income from their personel estates. It works pretty much the same here in the States. Back on the subject of this Room for Debate article, I hope the paparazzi will remenber the lesson learned in Paris, and give the new couple a break."

This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers.

It's not necessarily an act of childish defiance; it can be an all-in statement of what is important about this country. By the way, flag-burning is required by law. Last time I looked, it was the only proper way to dispose of a flag too worn to be flown any more."

Still, I always asked my parents to proofread my work before turning it in. Those evenings in which my parents edited at my side turned out to improve my writing so much more than my teachers ever could. That one-on-one, painstakingly specific instruction taught me that active voice is preferable to passive and that there is a difference between formal, academic essays and casual, creative writing. Just because my parents helped me craft an essay didn't mean I didn't learn to become a better writer from that experience, and it certainly didn't make me dependent on them throughout my life. My younger sister, on the other hand, resisted their help, preferring to do her work alone. She became an exceptional writer and went to a great school. In the end, each kid has different needs. I don't think you can make a blanket statement saying ""all parents should do this"" or ""all homework help (or homework, for that matter) is counterproductive."""

But for now, the deafening silence on the part of these players in the disaster that is the middle east indicate that all people entering the West from those countries should be suspect from a security standpoint, migrant, asylum seeker, or not. And that means finding out who, where and why these people are in Europe before any more are allowed and concurrently to deport those who are not valid asylum seekers.

The ""step"" is just too small over too long a time span. They are not going to do anything, ultimately, that will hurt their bottom line--they are a corporation. Public health is the government's job, but we've let the right turn that simple truth on its head to the point where we are thanking Wal Mart for the tiniest little concession--that is aimed more at improving their image that improving public health. When they stop the system of suppliers paying for a prominent space on the shelf and put the (non-instant) oatmeal where the sugary boxed cereal is and offer a demonstration of how simple it is to make oatmeal for breakfast (instead of pushing cereal bars, which are basically candy bars), I might start to think they are serious."

The Toyota Prius was also ridiculed for it's inability to be profitable when it first came out. Now it is the only car that Toyota dealers will not offer any incentive on. There will be leaders who will pay too much for electric cars of this type (remember the 15,000 LCD screens), but in a short period of time the prices will make our addiction to gas go away.

English is the language of our country.), the crime and the continuing ghettoization of cities (albeit just another sign of the failure of multiculturalism) and most folks would be happy to pay more at the greengrocer for US citizen-picked produce. The mantra of 'jobs Americans don't want' leaves out the 'at that pay' aspect.

Odds are that anyone who owns beach front property so alluring that total strangers would want to indulge in it is probably pretty well off, and in 21st century America nothing is more precious than safeguarding the rights and interests of those who are well off. The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens."
1912;20817;teacher training us;1;2;to be a good student person teacher get better at something;the intention of the tweet towards target 'teacher training us' is to advocate for the use of medication in the education of children with adhd.;The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior;I have two extremely gifted children with ADHD. Their bodies are constantly in motion, and when they were younger, they could be up and wandering the classroom without even being aware of it. They would blurt out answers, talk with their peers, and fidget ceaselessly. Part of it was boredom, yes, but with medication, they were able to learn how to monitor their behavior, to slow down their bodies, and to interact appropriately with their classmates. The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior. We parents were able to teach them self-control techniques. As they aged, we were able to wean them off meds, and they function just fine in high school. Unmedicated, I doubt they would have received the appropriately differentiated education that has allowed them to succeed in school. If a child truly has ADHD, then denying them medication is the equivalent of denying a near-sighted child glasses.

Israel is based on the Zionist premise of a Jewish state and this philosophy does not grant equal rights to all citizens. This is in total conflict with US values and is akin to apartheid South Africa -as pointed out by Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu. As for Israel first influence, it is not only the impact of the agent of a foreign government (AIPAC) but also wealthy donors like Sheldon Adelson who can provide the funds needed to make or break a domestic political campaign. What is worse is that many of these wealthy donors are more politically concerned about Israel than they are about the USA.
1914;1935;nutrition;1;1;to be healthy healthier successful win;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the idea that vegan athletes are superior to omnivorous ones, and to suggest that their success may be due to other factors.;any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN;Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people.

Millets can even be sprouted then pound into a flour, they are gluten free. Some millets contain high amounts of calcium as well. Quinoa is another rich source of nutrition all around. As far as brain food is concerned, dairy and dairy products make up for lack of meat protein. However for stric vegans who exclude fairly products or those with lactose intolerance, meat and meat products is a good option. Being flexible is a great thing, being too strict or restrictive doesn't help anyone. Moderation is key, mix of vegetarianism, non vegetarianism is awesome, if one is willing to be flexible. Life is colorful not black and white so why limit food?

We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth.

And where does this revenue come from? Thin air? The writer has to know this is a negative sum game, not even a zero sum game. For every dollar the city takes in, you can be sure the casino operators take at least five. The people who spend this money are overwhelmingly those who can't afford it, so that the 11 million they get back in services is less than what they lost in the first place. At the end of the day, the casino ends up making no new product, or service, other than escapist entertainment. But, but, but, you say, the casino puts the money back in the community. I bet. See the piece by Professor Simon on Atlantic City. Maybe the money does come out of thin air -- Canadians and non-Detroiters. Well that's great. Here you go, Paul. Sorry, Peter."

We filed the paperwork, paid for the fees , waited years for visa to be available, countless of trips to UCSIS , and U.S Consular. Years after years of waiting, we can now set foot on U.S head held high as legal immigrants. Meanwhile, illegal immigrants sneak into the U.S , anchor babies, expect to have benefits and free education without paying a penny. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Is is fair of legal immigrants like us ? Dear Mr Saavedra, have you ever been cut in line while you are lining up in a busy restaurant or theme park? That's the same feeling of legal immigrants toward illegal immigrants and freeloaders like you.

Besides in an era when we routinely overspend a few Bill per day or hour, what is $18B for border security, and we are turning people away, i say more money for more turnaways. The fantasy that employer sanctions is real, is the fantasy that out underground economy does not exist. To use our favored dug deal motif, if our purchasers of contraband, illegal labor, are the criminals, then the sellers are the greater criminals, sp stop illegal sales, of labor or drugs, at the border first. This employer focus is burden shifting and exonerates the offerors of illegal supplies. as well as being fantasy and employer-bashing.

Many universities are building empires at taxpayer expense - and it's a double whammy. Not only does the University itself enjoy not for profit status, but by expanding it is converting other tax-generating property into non-tax-paying property, diluting the tax rolls and forcing tax-payers to dig more deeply into our pockets.

My doctor recommended I add a supplement;"I am an omnivore who eats a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, eggs and moderate amounts of meat.

I don't bother with sunscreen unless I'm at the beach and get my sun from walking around the city and jogging in Central Park. However, at my last checkup, I discovered that I am deficient in vitamin D. My doctor recommended I add a supplement. It seems it's hard enough to get all the nutrients one needs for optimal health from an omnivore's diet. The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have always looked unhealthy to me, with sallow skin and dull hair. I knew a vegan who insisted on feeding her baby a vegan diet as well, and that poor child is underweight and I'm afraid to say not very bright. I will not condemn a vegan, however, for his or her dietary choices; I wish that those vegans who do take a self-righteous attitude toward non-vegans would not condemn us for ours."

What a fantasy;Of course what could go wrong. Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where.

If this guy was serious about health, he would call for alcohol prohibition. Why is alcohol okay? Because it's the drug of choice for white men. So he wants to live in a country where less harmful options to alcohol are illegal and those laws are enforced by judges and prosecutors who drink martinis to celebrate. Love this guy.
1935;10287;us diplomatic efforts in iran;1;1;to be a leader make difference helpful help;the author intends to criticize the suggestion of exploiting syria to bring iran to heel and advocates for diplomacy to resolve the conflict in syria.;Iran has shown some embarrassment at the use of chemical weapons in Syria;"At last! Someone is talking about Iran in relations to its ally Syria. But the last thing we need is some armchair warmonger suggesting we exploit Syria to bring Iran to heel. This is exactly the wrong prescription. It will stir the pot in the region even more. The US has yet to respond (in public, at least) to the election of a relative moderate as Iran's president. Iran has shown some embarrassment at the use of chemical weapons in Syria. A bit of diplomacy would be in order. President Obama should pick up the phone and call his Iranian counterpart; it's entirely possible that Iran could be persuaded to help broker some kind of settlement in Syria. There's at least some chance it might work; the odds are much better than those of a missile attack calming things down. The chances of that are zero."

However, I don't have a high income, nor do I make crucial contributions to domestic economic growth. All my spendable income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains. The total is about the reported median Adjusted Gross Income of Federal tax returns. (I have non-spendable taxable income due to converting money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.) I don't think it would be fair for me to pay no income tax while someone with the same amount of income from labor pays income tax. Count me among those who prefer a democracy that is economically non-optimal to a plutocracy that is economically optimal.

It has been proven time and again that the first Bush's tax increases started a business boom.

The danger is that weapon sales at that scale will change the calculations on each side and may trigger an immediate response from China that the US does not want to face. Also, not only did the US make promise to Taiwan, but also made promise to China.

How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties.
1940;17149;political students;1;1;to be open minded inclusive a leader inclusive. informed;the intention of the tweet towards political students is to encourage open political discussion and participation in the democratic process.;It's fine for students to discuss these different political dynamics;It's fine for students to discuss these different political dynamics, the world has all sorts of opinions and to constrain political thought is narrow. Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties. As far as voting, surely the Massachusetts Democrat Primary is a great example of how young people, students influenced the primary. The Boston area, Amherst, MA and other heavily populated college towns turned out strongly for Bernie Sanders. That was an extremely close race against a very established, heavily favored Hillary Clinton.
1941;8318;voting system;1;1;to be a good person have fair system leader everyone all;criticize the one-country/one-vote system in the un and fifa, suggest rotation of world cup venues, and advocate for term limits on fifa executives.;The one-country/one-vote system means that it becomes all too easy to;That's absolutely right! The one-country/one-vote system means that it becomes all too easy to corrupt the voting system by offering inducements/bribes to representatives of poor countries. However, to change the system to favour the developed world cannot be the way to go, neither in the UN nor in FIFA. My preference (hardly ideal, but practical) would be to have a rotation of World Cup venues: Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, Middle East. This would not eradicate corruption, but might well limit its scope. And, btw, it would be a very good idea to have term limits on elected FIFA executives. Blatter after Havelange is a sequence that does not inspire confidence.

If thoughts do not impact their professionalism, then spoken words should not. There appears to be nothing to prohibit their speaking about topics of interest to them.

I was one of those young voters. I have no doubt that young people today can similarly influence elections. And I sincerely hope they will.
1944;12664;public education system;1;1;to get a good job be teacher grade leader;criticizes the public education system for its inability to accurately measure learning and control for complex aspects of rigor, leading to unintended consequences such as increased need for mid-level administrators and decreased academic rigor.;No practical government ratings system could accurately measure learning while controlling for complex multiple aspects of rigor;"No practical government ratings system could accurately measure learning while controlling for complex multiple aspects of rigor in all fields and for the differing preparation and potential of students at each institution and in each program. Among the many unintended consequences would be an increased need for mid-level administrators, decreased academic rigor, and weakening of policies that lead to some student failures -- rigor and policies (like required attendance, participation, and timely work) on which the value of degrees to employers and graduate institutions is based. My specialized private non-profit college has many non-traditional students who come for artistic and technical training and don't plan to complete a degree (often because they already have one in a different field); they leave when they've learned the rare, highly marketable skills they came for and find work, but they depress the graduation rate despite their satisfaction and success. The value and effectiveness of colleges is not so easy to measure, and the unintended consequences of measuring them crudely could be devastating to many excellent, effective, but atypical institutions, or programs within institutions."
1945;18536;immigration;1;1;PersonX is a slave racist thinks about slavery get job;the intention of the tweet towards target 'immigration' is to argue against issuing work permits and ssns to undocumented immigrants, stating that it will create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community.;The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're;"As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation?"
1946;6754;abusive fees;1;0;to save money get a loan refund make;the intention of the tweet is to criticize abusive fees charged by banks for using their atms.;$7 in charges for a single withdrawal, that did not require any actions by a bank;My husband used an ATM from a different bank.He withdrew his own money, not a loan, not a cash advance on a credit card. There was a $3 charge for using the ATM. There was a $2 charge for checking the account balance. There was an additional $2 charge because it was a different bank's ATM. A total of $7 in charges for a single withdrawal, that did not require any actions by a bank employee, as was all handled electronically by computers. Explain to me where regulations, not greed cause these fees.
1947;13427;isis;1;0;to win the war be in power control a leader charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'isis' is to blame the us for creating isis in iraq and syria, and to suggest that the us should support assad to wipe out isis.;Help Assad, who was telling the truth since the start, stay in power, and let;We helped create ISIS in Iraq simply by occupying the country and bringing down the strongman that would not let them. We then exploited ISIS in Syria to fight against Assad. At first they fought side by side with the al-Nusra Front (Ayman Zawahiri's men) and both groups blended with the Syrian opposition. That was fine with us as long as they did what we wanted. But ISIS had their own agenda all along, and it excluded al-Nusra and the dumb rebels. Help Assad, who was telling the truth since the start, stay in power, and let Russia and Iran support him then ISIS will be wiped out. That is of course if we are done playing games.
1948;19112;dual citizenship;1;1;to be a good citizen person have life leader;the intention of the tweet is to express the complexity and emotional depth of having dual citizenship, and to question the validity of excluding those with dual citizenship from political leadership based on their perceived loyalty to one country over another.;Can you love your mother, your wife, your daugher without feeling unfaith;How can a person with the intelectual maturity of Ms. Bachman have been a candidate for president of the U.S.? It seems that most who wrote about this subject have only U.S. citizenship and therefore do not live and feel what dual, or multiple citizenship, is all about. Can you love your mother, your wife, your daugher without feeling unfaithful or a traitor? I have dual citizenship and I know how I feel about both countries: The one where my parents and family lived and struggled, the one of my culture, my music, its poets and writers, its cuisine, its beautiful topography and so much more, but also with some very negative things and the reason why I left. And now I have the one that welcome me, that gave me an oportunity for a better life, for safety and secutiy, for multidimendional growth. Can any one of you give me a good reason why I should swear off either one? And if this is what you are thinking, I'll take take of the wounded on either side.

When the Red states passed their anti-illegal laws liberals response was that they usurped the Federal Government's role as the sole authority where immigration was concerned. How does this proposal not do exactly the same thing albeit in the opposite direction?
1950;6006;silicon valley;1;1;to save money make get rich quick;the user expresses criticism of silicon valley startups prioritizing quick profits over serving all customers, using uber as an example, and laments the decline of focus on green energy due to its slower route to significant profits.;Seems like much of what comes out of Silicon Valley these days are schemes that make founder;Seems like much of what comes out of Silicon Valley these days are schemes that make founders rich quickly by cherry picking easy to serve customers. Uber is a perfect example - they can decline to serve certain customers and let the taxi industry act as their backup. And so on. The focus on green energy 10 years ago, something critical to the future, simply didn't generate big piles of money quickly enough to be a long term play.

Now, when I leave work around 5:30, I pick up my child from day care and head home to get dinner ready. Every single day. Ah, would that the happy hours could come again!
1952;4891;illegal labor;1;1;to make more money get a raise money. job;the tweet expresses opposition to the use of illegal labor in agriculture and argues that it would harm the growers' profits.;And don't forget all the other sectors of the economy where immigrant labor is used;Evidently the increase in agricultural workers salaries would eat into the growers profits. The opposition of the Farm lobby is indicative of that. Also, where would the replacement workers come from? Maybe some of the readers posting comments in favor of E verify would like to volunteer. And don't forget all the other sectors of the economy where immigrant labor is used. Yes, you can probably attract American workers with Google pay/benefit packages, but the Growers would go out of business due to the costs. And then, when the economy picked up, those workers would immediately move back to the city and we would be back to square one.
1953;1470;stock;1;0;to make a point be funny. funny statement;the intention of the tweet towards'stock' is to dismiss the credibility of richard bove's statement about the financial crisis and to suggest that a more reliable source would be someone like tim geithner.;Richard Bove told us in March 2008 that the financial crisis was over and that we all should;Richard Bove told us in March 2008 that the financial crisis was over and that we all should run out an buy bank stocks. So, pardon me if I do not take what he has to say too seriously. He a circus clown that is trotted out from time to time when a reporter needs to find that one remaining individual that still will publicly support the likes of JP Morgan and Goldman. What would be much more revealing is to get an actual player to comment, someone like Tim Geithner, who publicly opposed the TBTF concept, but in behind the scenes devoted his entire tenure at treasury to preserving the TBTF banks. I understand he is now busy counting his loot at Warburg, but perhaps between meals at Nobu he could give us a few words.
1954;8524;dual citizenship;1;1;to be a leader make difference inclusive patriotic;the intention of the tweet towards target 'dual citizenship' is to express frustration with the triviality of the debate and the focus on borders, and to suggest that dropping some unnecessary defenses could lead to a more global perspective and a better life for children.;This debate seems so trivial;As a native NY'r with Irish & Italian roots I am now married to a French national and living in France. This debate seems so trivial. And I am a patriot who has family members who actually fought for our country, infantry in the world wars & vietnam, unlike some presidents. America was founded by immigrants but oddly we often forget that, especially some politicians, as they fight for the scraps offered to them by these sorts of useless debates. Finally all this fosters are the borders that we put up. Perhaps if we dropped some useless defenses we could get on with thinking more globally, to provide our children with a broader view, habitat, and life. And maybe get past this tech & media frenzied pace that it (we?) seem to have created? Not sure but I think there may be bigger fish to fry.

If US agriculture is unsustainable without abusive labor practices, should we continue to prop up those practices?

You present customers as some sort of victims to the exploitative servers bad behaviors and claim tipping resulting from this is not ""capitalism.""

Wal-Mart is doing a good thing for its customers;I like this initiative. Wal-Mart is doing a good thing for its customers. Wal-Mart definitely deserves praise for using its power for good for once. Wal-Mart has caused many small businesses to go under and has had serious labor issues over the years. It really owes its customers and employees for their loyalty (even if, in some situations, Wal-Mart is the only game in town) and this healthy food initiative is a wonderful way to start.

It is unconstitutional intrusion. If Republicans back;I agree with McCluskey. It is unconstitutional intrusion. If Republicans back the idea, they definitely have not gotten the message. The federal government should not be financing education, either directly through grants or indirectly through tax credits. Education is a 100% responsibility and obligation of the states. I do support tax credits by the separate states, however. Home schooled children should get the same state financial backing given to public school attendees, and yes, that would be a threat to public education. So be it. They need the threat.

Israel is the only stable, democratic force in the region with the assets to protect Jerusalem. So, regardless of the benefit(s) to the state of Israel, it is in the world's interests to have foreign embassies to Israel in Jerusalem rather than Tel Aviv.

The current , virulent bashing of our nation's teachers as well as the Teach to the Test curriculum that they must adhere to, is evidence enough of this. Those of us in the classroom know that gone are critical thinking and earning your grade. They have been replaced with, ""I prepped for the exam"" and ""I tried hard, so give me an A."" Students no longer focus well or have the stamina to see through difficult problems. If they cannot solve a problem quickly, they give up (move on to next question, kids, time is running out). This country's test-prep educational policy weakens our students' ability to struggle with a challenging problem, and denies them the sense of accomplishment when they succeed. Are people getting dumber? It sure seems that way to me."

It makes nos sense that this;Iran is entirely unaware of the fact that it has no tangible quarrel with Israel. Iran is not interested in helping the Palestinians. Iranians don't like Arabs. Iran's leaders hate Sunnis. Palestinians are both Arabs and Sunnis. Iran used to have a friendly and productive relationship with Israel. It makes nos sense that this friendship has ended. The most intense and dangerous of all hatreds are those that make no sense. If Iran's mullahs understood that it makes no sense for them to oppose Israel's existence, they could turn Iran into a secure and prosperous country at once.

When was the last time a first-grader at a high-end Manhattan, Westchester, or Nassau private or public school picked up a chair over their head and threw it at a classmate, or told the teacher, using several of George Carlin's seven words, to perform an anatomically impossible act?
1969;20681;refugee intake;1;2;to be rich get make money wealthy;the intention of this tweet is to express concern and outrage about increasing wealth inequality, predicting social unrest and criticizing the creation of low-paying service jobs.;The lives they have in mind for us and our children will not be worth living;That's where we've been heading and it's just going to get worse. Those of us who need to work for a living, and that's most of us, will be paying the bills and the rich and superrich will be collecting the rewards.

There will be riots in the streets ultimately and there should be. The lives they have in mind for us and our children will not be worth living. And when you have nothing left to lose you can start burning down the world you are forced to live in.

""No problem,"" replied the boss. I'm seated with a dozen workers in an open-space environment with low partitions, lots of sunshine, ample alcoves and informal meeting spaces for on-the-fly discussions. Why does this work? Because the studio saved _even more_ money by eliminating . . . telephones! Gotta call your kid's school? Use your own cellphone and go find an alcove. Confidential news to share with the boss? Write an email, send an instant message, schedule a private conference room, or convene in the Commissary. Sounds repellent, but in truth, it works. Use your computer for communications. There's still a finite amount of space, so we can't shoehorn many more people into this environment without tipping the comfort level, the primary concern now."

This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own."

If we do nationalize them, at least do it the way we created Government Motors, creating smaller leaner institutions. I would support the Warren-McCain Glass-Steagall Act update. The one issue overlooked in this discussion is the lobbying power of Wall Street bankers that is a roadblock to host of issues from tax reform to their War on the Poor to regulation. Could I suggest that a change in the phraseology from Too Big to Fail to Too Big to Regulate?
1975;4738;drug;1;1;to not be addicted get avoid addiction healthy;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the perception of marijuana as a gateway drug and to emphasize the need to address mental disorder addiction rather than the substance itself.;Marijuana is no more a gateway drug than alcohol or milk;Marijuana is no more a gateway drug than alcohol or milk for that matter. Addiction disorder comes in many forms, but it is the mental disorder that requires our attention and not the vice. Haven't we wasted enough time, money and lives to learn this lesson???

I have a pacemaker. My heart specialist gave me a full explanation and answered questions both before and after insertion. But I found a few sites that gave me information that was helpful, such as a little thing about sleeping on the side where the pacemaker was and how to do it comfortably. I have benign essential tremor. I've learned a vast amount about it from onsite articles, and the most helpful ones are those that give me pointers on how to deal with the increasing tremors over time. I like being able to access the internet about my health issues, and find I can talk with my doctors more intelligently and ask the right questions because I have used the internet.

I really can't put into words how happy it makes me to see people knocking down these illogical and dangerous beliefs. I had expected to see scores of comments supporting her but instead I see only a bare handful of people expressing tepid support. Maybe, just maybe, we are starting to put this anti-vax madness behind us.
1978;10650;global warming;1;0;to be a leader independent informed honest;the intention of the tweet towards target 'global warming' is to urge the media outlets to make the candidates take a stand on this issue.;I will never vote for an over population denier or a global warming denier;I have said before in these pages that I will never again vote for the lesser of two evils. Now I see that I must add that I will never vote for an over population denier or a global warming denier. Please New York Times and other media outlets make the candidates take a stand on these issues. We must have true leaders more than ever now.
1979;18209;disenfranchised people;1;1;to be inclusive fair help people;the intention of the tweet is to suggest a disenfranchised index that focuses on factors other than race and gender to help those who score lower early in life.;help those that score lower as early in life as possible;We should establish a Disenfranchised Index that looks, at many things ( examples include): neighborhood, parents (one or two), parent's own education and their income, family stability and environment, family history around employment, public assitance access to opportunityetc) and help those that score lower as early in life as possible. It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment.
1980;16120;control;1;0;to be in charge control make money the best money.;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for control over the banking industry to prevent banks from becoming too powerful and taking over the economy.;The banks need to be managed so that they do not drown in their own bubbles, but;The banks are in the business of using the US economy to make money. Usually this is good for both the banks and the rest of the economy, but sometimes the banks make it much more beneficial for them than for the economy. The best managed companies on the planet will be the ones that can extort the most from everybody else by getting rid of fair competition on a level playing field. Like a well-managed army, they are aggressive as well as efficient. The banks need to be managed so that they do not drown in their own bubbles, but also so they do not take over the rest of the economy.

The key question is whether ""child abuse and exploitation of women are not inherent in polygamy,"" as the author states. Professor Banks, can you site a single existing or historical example of a society that allowed polygamy but wasn't patriarchal or didn't exploit women? You can't, because there aren't any such examples. Every shred of evidence, present and past, shows that child abuse and exploitation of women ARE inherent in polygamy."
1982;20229;europe;1;2;people to do get fired work hard;the author expresses frustration with management and marketing, perceiving their ideas as unintelligent and detrimental, particularly open office plans, while emphasizing the importance of concentration and thought in jobs.;There are jobs that do no require concentration, focus, thought, or problem solving. Management is;There are jobs that do no require concentration, focus, thought, or problem solving. Management is such a job. Marketing and sales is another. But for most everyone else open offices are the worst idea of all times. You will see that management will come up with such stupid ideas, and the marketing people will love it. The concept of thought is foreign to them, they think that the world goes around by everyone attending meetings all day. Again, worst idea of all times.

None would;There are plenty of middlemen who would garner their profits on the increased wages. None would forego their cut -- and the retailer gets the largest share of that. Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects. If more people could employ themselves on farms, we might have a better outcome. But our incentives are not set up to promote that. Correct the incentives. We don't need more factory farms.
1984;19796;greater success;1;2;to do their best be independent successful learn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'greater success' is to emphasize the importance of individualized instruction and personalized learning.;Still, I always asked my parents to proofread my work before turning it in;"Growing up, I was always a high academic achiever. Still, I always asked my parents to proofread my work before turning it in. Those evenings in which my parents edited at my side turned out to improve my writing so much more than my teachers ever could. That one-on-one, painstakingly specific instruction taught me that active voice is preferable to passive and that there is a difference between formal, academic essays and casual, creative writing. Just because my parents helped me craft an essay didn't mean I didn't learn to become a better writer from that experience, and it certainly didn't make me dependent on them throughout my life. My younger sister, on the other hand, resisted their help, preferring to do her work alone. She became an exceptional writer and went to a great school. In the end, each kid has different needs. I don't think you can make a blanket statement saying ""all parents should do this"" or ""all homework help (or homework, for that matter) is counterproductive."""

An Atlantic spill would affect a heck off a lot more people than would a spill in the Arctic so how does this make sense politically? Last I checked wildlife doesn't vote. I have yet to see a good explanation for this decision, either from a political or an environmental position. If there is one I would like to hear it. Would a spill in the Atlantic 50 miles out disperse away from the coast more than would a spill in the Arctic or the Gulf? Because there surely will be one no matter how much the ""our drilling rigs, pipelines and trains are safe"" oil executives say."
1986;25;not adopting cats that you cn not take care of.;1;0;to be a good parent person friend help the children responsible;the intention of the tweet is to discourage adopting cats that cannot be properly cared for.;People should not adopt animals whose needs they cannot meet, regardless of what might seem beneficial to;People should not adopt animals whose needs they cannot meet, regardless of what might seem beneficial to the children in the house. If a family for some reason needs a declawed cat, that family should adopt one of the many from a shelter rather than adopting an unaltered cat and declawing him to their convenience and his detriment.

We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed;I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all.

Farming is now a big business with many farms being large scale industrial enterprises and many farmers are now millionaires. Better to impose tariffs on foreign imports than continue to feed hogs with out tax dollars. As Harry Truman said, "" If you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen."""
1989;12360;educational vacation times;1;1;to be helpful have fun learn something teach others;the intention of the tweet is to promote educational vacation times as a pleasurable learning experience that creates lasting memories.;Good argument. We forget we have an obligation to also teach our children. A family vacation to;Good argument. We forget we have an obligation to also teach our children. A family vacation to the beach, the mountain or a foreign country is a subtle, pleasurable learning experience, and in addition, hopefully creating loving memories that last a lifetime.

I have no choice; I have to get the shot. I would get a flu shot anyway but it does not feel good to be forced, it makes me very angry. I strongly believe in immunization and believe people should be encouraged and educated about why immunizations are important but I don't think forcing people is the right answer. I also believe that schools and day care centers should have the right to refuse to accept kids who have not been immunized."
1991;14703;rat experiments;1;0;to be a scientist make point honest informed;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'rat experiments' is to challenge the validity of the legalization debate by pointing out the correlation between human addiction and deprived, abusive environments, as established by the rat park experiments.;a public jaded by decades of lies;Legalization is just too dangerous, says Ms. Evins. Has she studied the Rat Park experiments? Conducted over 20 years in a prestigious lab, then published as peer-reviewed journal studies, they establish that addiction is almost impossible to induce when the subjects are living in healthy environments. Oh, one detail: the subjects were rats...which correlate to humans 80% of the time in lab study results. So there's an 80% chance that human addiction results not from the substance but from deprived, abusive environments. There is a place she could put her efforts productively, instead of fighting a losing battle against a public jaded by decades of lies.
1992;7998;culture;1;0;to be left alone alone. in control not bothered;criticizes the impact of technology on human communication and relationships.;During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said;"I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology."
1993;14087;sports program in undergraduate schools;1;0;to be healthy healthy. get better feel;the intention of the tweet is to express a desire for a non-competitive sports program in undergraduate schools.;I was not just sidelined but humiliated, and not just by my fellow students;Throughout my school years--from elementary school on--I was completely incompetent in every kind of physical activity that I tried. As a result, in the competitive environment that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s (and, I suspect, continues to the present), I was not just sidelined but humiliated, and not just by my fellow students, but by adult coaches, too. To this day, I hate sports. Now, in my 60s, I wish there had been programs for kids like me, that might have introduced me to physical exercise in a non-competitive setting. Maybe I could have become more physically active and found some healthy physical activities that I could enjoy.
1994;215;economic development and sustainability;1;0;to learn something new be a leader gain knowledge;the intention of the tweet towards economic development and sustainability is that the author concludes that mr. nair's statements are true based on courses taken online via coursera, but the author questions whether it is human nature to prevent us from overcoming our addictions to ego and hedonism, and balance with humility is an ephemeral conceit.;This is a great statement. After taking Jeffrey Sachs' and Peter Singer's courses;This is a great statement. After taking Jeffrey Sachs' and Peter Singer's courses online via Coursera for free, it is abundantly clear to me that from the perspectives of economic development, sustainability and ethics all that Mr. Nair concludes is true. Problem is whether it is simply human nature which will prevent us from overcoming our collective addictions to ego and hedonism, and that balance with humility is an ephemeral conceit.
1995;17151;two party system;1;1;to be open minded inclusive a leader inclusive. informed;criticizes the two-party system.;Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties;It's fine for students to discuss these different political dynamics, the world has all sorts of opinions and to constrain political thought is narrow. Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties. As far as voting, surely the Massachusetts Democrat Primary is a great example of how young people, students influenced the primary. The Boston area, Amherst, MA and other heavily populated college towns turned out strongly for Bernie Sanders. That was an extremely close race against a very established, heavily favored Hillary Clinton.
1996;6825;more serious crime;1;0;to get rid of something be a good citizen people in control charge;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that there are ways to deal with low-level crimes without arresting people, and that more serious crimes should be addressed separately.;someone with a quality of life crime (like selling illegal cigarettes) can be dealt with by;I don't think the broken windows theory itself is bad, I think there is a lot of validity to it.Having lived in marginal areas, things like graffiti, kids hanging out where they shouldn't, attractive nuisances, make a big difference in how a neighborhood functions. That said, what is old is new. Ask any long time New Yorker, and they will tell you about the beat cop, who knew what was going on, and knew who were the troublemakers, and knew how to deal with them appropriately. While it is a different era now, someone with a quality of life crime (like selling illegal cigarettes) can be dealt with by basically telling them to get lost and not show his face on 'his' street again. There are ways of using the force and power of the law without arresting people. If the person doesn't get the hint, or otherwise acts out, you always have the arrest as a backup, but most low level people will avoid the confrontation.
1997;16545;miss america;1;0;to be a good parent mother person in control;the author's intention towards miss america is to discourage their daughters from participating in the pageant.;I will NOT, as you say, encourage them to consider competing in the Miss American page;"HAHA! I am soon to be the mother of two smart young women. They're too young now to be eligible for Miss America. But I can assure you, I will NOT, as you say, encourage them to ""consider competing in the Miss American pageant."" NO WAY. I will vociferously DIScourage them from doing so. Any ""scholarship"" competition that asks my daughter to put on a swimsuit without asking them to actually swim; or put on a dress that she has not designed and sewn herself is NOT a competition we want to be involved with. Any job or school that asks her to submit a photograph of herself for the purposes of judging her attractiveness: also, no. It's a farce, Ms. Friedman. You've been sold a false bag of goods. You don't have to be slender and gorgeous to be a scientist, musician, policy advocate, or any other such important job. Not even to be a TV pundit. Well, if you're a man, anyway. Plenty of gnarly looking men have front and center jobs in front of the camera. Hm."
1998;21729;capital gain;1;2;to help the poor make money. get a raise money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gain' is to argue against a policy that would eliminate tips and create a lower wage for service workers, potentially leading to a decrease in the quality of service and an increase in the number of desperate workers.;Eliminating tips and creating a higher, but still very low wage, would create another;Eliminating tips and creating a higher, but still very low wage, would create another sinkhole hold for the American worker. Right now, tips put some of the power in the hands of the service person. Taking away tips would create yet another job where the restaurant would hire as cheaply as possible, and the people hired would be those the most desperate. Tips are the way in which a service job becomes more than that...and it needs to stay that way.
1999;12253;the free market;1;0;to make the right decision choice best be a good person;the intention of the tweet is to support the free market.;Here the market will adjust and the consumer will eventually win;This is a larger, more complex and more nuanced problem than administering the VA. How did the government do on that score? Here the market will adjust and the consumer will eventually win. Parents are already making more informed decisions without politically motivated advice.
2000;11341;dual citizanship;1;0;to be a good citizen person inclusive;critical of dual citizenship, particularly when it involves a political figure.;when someone loses a campaign to be president of the United States, and then immediately files;I don't care about most people's dual citizenship, but when someone loses a campaign to be president of the United States, and then immediately files for citizenship in another country, I am curious. What the heck is Michelle thinking? Imagine if this was not a white woman claiming citizenship in a northern European country, but a black man affirming citizenship in an African country--the howls would be heard all the way to Africa! Michelle Bachmann is not a loyal American. Switzerland is welcome to her, and I hope she keeps her poisonous politics out of our faces. I question whether a dual citizen should be a member of Congress. And yes, i am aware of the dual Israeli-American citizenship issue.
2001;20234;u.s. embassy;1;2;to be in control charge power feel superior;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'u.s. embassy' is to criticize the actions of muslims and their perceived lack of respect for other religions, using the burning of bibles and torah scrolls and the murder of a guard at the tomb of joseph as examples.;You get what you give. You don't give respect to others, not even lip service;I didn't see any Muslim outcry when Muslims burned Bibles and Torah scrolls (at $35,000 @) and burnt down a religious snactuary, and murdered a guard in cold blood at the Tomb of Joseph, a holy site for Jews. Muslims are sensitive to their own beliefs and values, but seemingly have no respect whatsoever for anyone else's religion or beliefs. You get what you give. You don't give respect to others, not even lip service you don't get any respect.
2002;17817;crime;1;1;to make a difference be leader change the system in power;the intention of the tweet towards target 'crime' is to argue that people convicted of crimes retain their interest in how their class is treated, and that their knowledge of the unfairness of incarceration is crucial in changing the way society treats people who have erred.;People convicted of crimes don't lose their interest in how their class is treated;People convicted of crimes don't lose their interest in how their class is treated. While the Constitution barred slave, women and who knows from voting, times have changed. Without those who know the unfairness of incarceration, the voter lists would be tipped in favor of those who want to continue the incarceration industry. Once released and encouraged to renter after paying their debt, how can they be denied the right to help select someone who might change the way society treats people who have erred?
2003;6445;office layout;1;1;to solve a problem problem. get good grade the;the intention of the tweet towards target 'office layout' is to criticize the open plan layout for its distractions and negative impact on productivity.;an open plan can be the kiss of death;This is hardly a 'first generation' problem. For jobs requiring quiet and deep immersion in thought, an open plan can be the kiss of death. Almost thirty years ago temporary removal of cubicle walls in my IT department created chaos. It sometimes takes quite a bit of time to mentally drill down to the core of a problem. The constant distractions, visual and aural, of a badly designed open plan can, in a moment, put you right back in square one. Repeat until end of day, every day, and see how productive you are.
2004;16438;grizzly;1;2;to make a point prove his be chef;the intention of the tweet towards 'grizzly' is to criticize the argument made in the nyt article, stating that it is based on a flawed comparison with the grizzly bear and lacks knowledge of biology and evolution.;"Since when did we start basing our knowledge of what animals have been ""designed"" to";"No offense, Brian Patton, but this is by far the worst argument I have ever read in the NYT. Since when did we start basing our knowledge of what animals have been ""designed"" to eat on comparisons with the grizzly bear? So because a fox can't take down a deer, it should secretly be an herbivore? And no, we don't look like grizzlies, but we do look a hell of a lot like chimps and other primates that will rip animals apart with their bare hands and ""digest the raw innards"" just fine. Please don't base your argument on ""the logic of the animal kingdom"" when you clearly have no concept of biology or evolution. You're a chef, so you presumably know a lot about food. Why not construct an argument around the food itself instead of a subject you don't seem to know anything about? Just a suggestion. Thanks. Hugs and kisses. P.S. How did this actually make it into print? NYT editors, I expected better."
2005;8338;privacy;1;1;to be in control charge responsible helpful;the intention of the tweet is to argue that parents who monitor their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy, but rather are being cyber-savvy and involved in keeping their children safe.;Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least;"I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that ""Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved."" As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father. Someone's got to be the adult in the parent-child dynamic, and my kids, as wonderful as they are, are not 'it'. Mark Gary Blumenthal, MD, MPH Knoxville, TN"
2006;2774;slavery;1;0;to make a profit be slave point money compensated;the intention of the tweet is to argue for reparations for slavery, specifically from west african countries that profited from the trade.;The West African slave trade was driven largely by internecine tribal warfare;A note regarding reparations for slavery: The West African slave trade was driven largely by internecine tribal warfare, in the course of which captured soldiers and civilians would often be sold as human chattel. European countries, followed by their western colonies, profited from this trade for several hundred years....a blot on their history, no doubt. But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial. So if there is to be compensation, perhaps it should come first from Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries....that is, from the descendants of those who sold so many of their so-called brothers and sisters into bondage, for as long as the rest of the world allowed it.
2007;3112;middle east;1;0;to protect their own his country people be safe;the intention of the tweet towards the target'middle east' is to restrict immigration and visas from the region during a time of war.;Every nation in the Middle East, with the possible exception of Jordan, is a a;The world is a mean, cold, hard, ugly place. A soveriegn nation's highest call is to protect its citizens. Allowing tens of thousands of random refugees asylum makes a nation less secure. A nation must take care of its own first. Only then can it help outsiders. Ideally, those two objectives will not clash. In a time of war, however, they are in direct conflict. Europe needs to not only allow zero new refugees in, but it needs to cancel all current visas and issue no new visas to citizens from the Middle East. When this war is over, when Islam in the Middle East finally undoes its extremist rigging, then immigration and visas may begin again. After all, in 1943, we weren't taking in any German or Japanese refugees, or allowing them to come in on student or work visas. Every nation in the Middle East, with the possible exception of Jordan, is a a grave enemy to values and security of the West. This is a war now. We must act on a war footing.
2008;7519;immigrant;1;1;to be self-sufficient a good citizen neighbor self sufficient help the poor;the intention of the tweet towards 'immigrant' is to suggest formalizing the terms of mutual interests by expanding the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country while enforcing immigration laws.;If someone is good enough to build America, he is good enough to make his permanent home;If we are that dependent upon the labor of immigrants (and I suspect we are), we should formalize the terms of our mutual interests by expanding the numbers of those allowed into the country to work legally while also enforcing the immigration laws to ensure those quotas are not exceeded. Perhaps we can set up some kind of regional clearing houses through which farmers can submit their anticipated labor needs for the season, which the government will assist in providing vetted immigrant labor from among those registering with it overseas as available for such placement. Again, though, we have no business exploiting foreign labor. If someone is good enough to build America, he is good enough to make his permanent home here and to become one of us.
2009;11151;marijuana;1;1;to be a leader in control make money profit;the intention of the tweet is to correct the misconception that marijuana is a new big business, and to promote the benefits of legalization such as regulation, taxation, and reduced enforcement and incarceration costs.;marijuana has been big business for decades;"""Marijuana Is Now Big Business"" Wrong - marijuana has been big business for decades. The California Dept. of Agriculture has listed it as the number one cash crop in the state for over 20 years in a row. Now, the business is above ground, where it should be. Regulation, taxation, better education, savings in enforcement and incarceration costs - everybody wins. We are slowly now heading in the right direction - ending the biggest and most widespread wrongful jailing of American citizens since slavery. It can't happen quick enough."

I used to have constant nightmares that would wake me up in the middle of the night. I remember trying very hard to wake up from them, one day it worked and from them on I was able to wake up whenever I wanted. I think that to make myself aware that I was having a nightmare was the first step to put an end to my nightmares, because only then I could then make myself wake up. Today, I can not only wake up when I want, but I can also manipulate my dreams (well, most of them at least) and, if one of my dreams is interrupted, I can sleep and go back to it. Today, most of my dreams are the fantastic kind, and I look forward to going to sleep every night!
2011;7491;big banks;1;0;to not get in trouble into worry about it be;criticizes the argument that big banks no longer pose a threat to the financial system due to lack of recent jeopardy, highlights jpmorgan chase's failure to control its own traders and internal controls, and warns of the risk of growth leading to increased problems and risks to the system.;Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial;Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly.
2012;16147;a bad deal for cities and states;1;0;to make money get rich save be;the intention of the tweet is to criticize privatization as a bad deal for cities and states.;In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay;In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness?
2013;17551;government taling money from education;1;1;to be ignorant believe the lies ignorant. lie;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the government's decision to defund the public school system.;This is just another conservative ploy to defund the public school system;This is just another conservative ploy to defund the public school system. The goal is to make Americans as ignorant as possible, so that they'll believe the lies that Limbaugh, Beck, and the rest of the conservative propaganda machine are pushing on us.
2014;18158;restaurant;1;1;to be sociable talk them friendly social;the user observed and expressed surprise at a social situation where three women were not interacting with men at their table, instead focused on their phones, and expressed a desire to encourage more interaction between them.;3 females were busy checking each other's photos and text messages on all 3 of their;Absolutely. I experienced a similar, perhaps even more unsettling thing: Picking up an order at a restaurant recently, for which I had to wait, and there were many young college folks. At one table, 3 women, 2 men. They were all attractive young people, and you would think the females might be talking with the guys, yes? No - the 3 females were busy checking each other's photos and text messages on all 3 of their iPhones, giggling, sharing, not interacting with the guys at all. I wanted to go over and tell them, Hey, do you realize you have some great opportunities to learn about these guys here, if you just talked with them?
2015;21159;homeschooling;1;2;to protect their child his the children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'homeschooling' is to argue that parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are free riders and should be held liable for the consequences of their choice.;This is a choice that might endanger others;I am a libertarian, but this is not a purely self-regarding choice. RC is right. This is a choice that might endanger others. If a parent's failure to allow their children to be vaccinated creates a transmission belt for an infectious disease, then the parent should be liable for the consequences of their choice. Moreover, the parent who won't let their child be vaccinated is a free rider. Other parents are accepting a minuscule -- but real risk -- of an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Their decision helps to protect the child of the free-riding parent because the vaccinated child serves as a sort of firebreak to slow the spread of the disease.
2016;9336;medical research;1;1;to be informed get better learn more;the intention of the tweet is to encourage readers to seek medical advice from research articles and not rely solely on medical websites or doctors.;What really gives good options is the reading of research articles themselves;The debate seems limited to certain medical websites. What really gives good options is the reading of research articles themselves. Yes, it requires more education and some knowledge of anatomy, neurology, etc. But those who can do it, can find doctors and researchers willing to treat them. And they can manage their problems much better than if they relied on a single doctor. And don't forget, the US is almost the last resort for medical advice. Big pharma here is unfettered and excludes supplements and unpatentable drugs. Much research is going on elsewhere in the world. You must read those articles, and act accordingly. Read Swiss, Italian, Armenia, Turksih researchers!
2017;9031;tax breaks;1;0;to be in control charge a leader power;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tax breaks' is to criticize the nfl's use of tax breaks while neglecting the needs of ordinary citizens.;no no and hell no;no no and hell no - when cities and states give breaks and build stadiums for this 'non-profit' league but turn off water to ordinary citizens or threaten more cuts to the floor of existence - where the heck is our sense of community of compassion and care - not for ordinary folks - who can afford a ticket let alone the drain from infrastructure..... argh! Pay for your own playgrounds NFL - you are knocking brains apart - no wonder you make the decisions you do!
2018;7222;research papers;1;1;to be in control knowledgeable smart learn;the intention of the tweet towards target'research papers' is to criticize the belief that having access to information is the same as being able to use it effectively, and that research papers require obtaining, analyzing, and utilizing information.;A research paper, at its core, requires that information be: > obtained > analyzed;"I cannot remember a time when all the invited essays on a Room for Debate, by and large, agreed with each other. These times are lauded as the Age of Information. But the simple reality missing from the premise of this debate is having ACCESS to information is not the same as being able to USE information. A research paper, at its core, requires that information be: > obtained; > analyzed; then > utilized. How could this EVER become obsolete? Yes, it is demoralizing that too many students believe that Google relieves them of any obligation to actually acquire skills of investigation, evaluation, and synthesis or that experts like librarians are obsolete. However, when a graduate program's provides a list of companion articles for courses and then the library provides one-click access to each and every article, they both are complicit in contributing to their own obsolescence."
2019;17131;conservative;1;0;to be fair fair. respectful mean;criticize the target 'conservative' for their comments during court hearings.;patronizing and uninformed;It is arbitrary and misguided to criticize RGB for these comments she made outside of work while we apparently tolerate/tolerated some of the clearly patronizing and uninformed (and if you're not feeling generous, downright sexist, racist, classist, and homophic) lines of questioning from conservative judges like Roberts and Scalia during actual hearings. Why censure RGB for saying she thinks a certain candidate threatens the institution she represents if we're not going to censure others for saying during court that poor black folks are categorically unworthy/unprepared equal education opportunities or that gay people perhaps are worse parents than no parents at all?
2020;6326;social media;1;1;to be like others popular everyone trendy;the user expresses their view that popular fashion websites, particularly tumblr, influence fashion trends and individuality among teenagers.;all individuality is lost;I truly believe that fashion everywhere is influenced not only by the same people, but by the same websites. If anyone here is familiar with Tumblr, Lookbook, or Polyvore they will know what I'm talking about. Especially on places like Tumblr, where the point is to re-blog photos/text/videos that other people have posted, all individuality is lost. Photos of studded shorts, girls in bikinis, black calf-height socks with sneakers, and YSL rings are ultra-popular, which has an impact on the teenagers who use Tumblr. And it's the teenagers(like myself) who have established the 'Hipster Uniform', so to speak.
2021;21797;foreign language class;1;2;to be a parent get job help them;the intention of this tweet is to advise against postponing having children for the sake of a job, emphasizing the challenges of raising children and the benefits of experiencing their struggles at a younger age.;I agree with Robin. I had my babies at age 37 and 39, and they graduated college;I agree with Robin. I had my babies at age 37 and 39, and they graduated college, and now I'm 61 and feel my age. They worry that I won't be able to take care of my grandchildren, whenever that happens. My mother was 40 when I was born, and never knew either child (she died at age 78). So don't postpone for a job, that's my advice. A job is just a job. Having children is exhausting, and you will understand their problems a whole lot better if you are younger rather than older.
2022;9440;conservative;1;1;to be able vote a good citizen in power charge;the user expresses skepticism towards conservatives' push for restrictive government programs, questioning the cost and fairness of evaluating ex-convicts' eligibility to vote, and advocating for inclusive voting rights, including for current convicts, to uphold democracy.;conservatives always want a big government program to restrict individual liberty;"What are these "" certain standards of responsibility and commitment?"" I can only recall an age requirement. And why is it that conservatives always want a big government program to restrict individual liberty? Any idea of the cost providing each ex-con a review to determine if they have reformed enough to vote? People even current convicts should be allowed, yea encouraged, to vote or we do not have a democracy."
2023;14197;everyone;1;0;to get a job have make money be successful;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration and disappointment towards the education system for not providing specialized skills and to criticize the belief that a degree is all that is needed for a successful career.;I made the mistake of believing people when they said all I needed was a degree. They;"I look at my resume and realize that despite having a Bachelors Degree in Communications, I still don't really have any jobs skills. My education failed me because it didn't provide me with any real specialized skill. And because of that, it seems like I""m destined to low paying office jobs as Office Assistants or Call Center Rep. I made the mistake of believing people when they said all I needed was a degree. They were wrong. All I can tell anyone is I'm barely proficent in MS Word and Excel, and I know how to press the start button on a copy machine. I somehow went through 4 years of college without learning anything real."
2024;1193;human rights;1;0;nothing to do with them be a good person it in control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'human rights' is to criticize the us government for its actions and policies that violate human rights.;disregarding the most basic human rights anywhere in the world;Sorry to brake the news but the US looks nowadays like an inflated old, very yucky USSR. Killing and maiming across the world and the seven seas, arming Israel to the teeth and disregarding the most basic human rights anywhere in the world, even in the US where people (mostly men) get shot left and right every day.
2025;18179;job;1;2;to get a better job the best jobs make point.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'job' is to question the assertion that immigrants take jobs from american-born workers and to suggest that other factors, such as job outsourcing and lack of upwards social mobility, may be more significant causes of the decline in employment opportunities.;America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the;"""Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?"" seems to imply those jobs belong to native-born workers by right. That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education?"
2026;16091;vaccine;1;1;to save lives be safe healthy help;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'vaccine' is to emphasize the importance of vaccines in preventing epidemics and saving children from devastating diseases.;Vaccines are not just for the child being vaccinated. It's;"Vaccines are not just for the child being vaccinated. It's about preventing epidemics from diseases that have in the past have left children deaf, blind, paralyzed, brain damaged. I didn't understand who devastating theses diseases were until I volunteered in another country and witnessed the grief of parents whose children died from preventable diseases. The promotion of vaccines should read ""Vaccines. Because it's not all about you"""
2027;13188;overcrowded national parks;1;0;to help the poor be rich a leader make money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the overcrowding of national parks and suggest solutions to address it.;Just what we need in this country, more recreation areas for the rich. Let's make;Just what we need in this country, more recreation areas for the rich. Let's make sure the fees are raised enough to keep out the riff raff. Then we can put in an airport for the private planes of the rich. Hey, how about a Trump Tower in Yosemite? I'm sure Donald would go for it.
2028;9493;amy chua;1;1;to be in charge control a leader strict authoritative;the intention of the tweet towards amy chua is to acknowledge her credibility as a strict disciplinarian and a professor at yale.;Amy Chua is a professor At Yale;Let's not forget that Amy Chua is a professor At Yale and that she can point that out to her children if they ever question her methods Having the street cred when it comes to imparting such strict discipline is pretty useful. Compare that to the run of the mill parent trying to be strict. Generally,there will be rebellion.
2029;11591;librarian;1;1;to be a teacher in charge help kids learn helpful teach;the intention of the tweet is to suggest a solution to protect librarians by incorporating research methods and information literacy into the mandated curriculum.;Librarians might find some protection if they were to get back in the classroom and teach;Librarians might find some protection if they were to get back in the classroom and teach a course for credit on research methods. Most school librarians are already certified teachers, so this would not be a difficult transition. Librarians are involved in classroom instruction, but usually in the classroom of another teacher. Let's get research skills or information literacy into the mandated curriculum and protect our kids' libraries and librarians.
2030;15909;mother teresa;1;0;to be helpful help others people;the tweet is critical of mother teresa's medical practices and her perceived lack of concern for the poor.;Her holiness is as much a product of good press as it is of actually doing;Rendering substandard, even dangerous medical care is not much of a recommendation. Withholding pain meds because suffering is good for ya - that's not just imperfection, that's malpractice. Her holiness is as much a product of good press as it is of actually doing all she could for the poor. She had money and sent some to the Vatican. She had money but reused needles and gave care on the cheap. Some saint.
2031;12267;education;1;1;to get some rest sleep a break be productive;the intention of the tweet is to question the feasibility of longer school days and the potential negative impact on children's decision-making abilities due to the afternoon slump.;The NYT recently ran an article about how people lose the ability to make decisions as it gets;The NYT recently ran an article about how people lose the ability to make decisions as it gets later in the afternoon. The example given was that parole boards cease giving parole to prisoners whose cases come up in the afternoon, not because these inmated had worse cases but because , by afternoon, the human brain needs a break and decides not to decide. How does this new research fit into longer school days? Will late afternoon classes be useless? I know at work most people I know, including myself, run out of steam at about 3 p.m. If adults can't keep up to par all day, how are children expected to make decisions all day?
2032;16387;public preschool;1;1;to get a good grade be student education prepared for school make sure they learn;the user is emphasizing the increased academic focus of kindergarten today, and the resulting importance of attending preschool to ensure readiness and better performance compared to non-preschool attendants.;In many schools, if you aren't beginning to read by the time you start;I didn't go to preschool. But kindergarten back then was mostly play, milk and cookies. My son did go to preschool because we knew that kindergarten today is more like what first/second grade used to be. In many schools, if you aren't beginning to read by the time you start kindergarten, you will be behind. Comparing Head Start kids to kids who don't attend preschool may not yield a difference. Compare Montessori or private preschool kids to kids who don't attend preschool and you will absolutely see a difference. Big difference.
2033;12096;instant gratification;1;0;to be the best in control feel good. charge;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the culture of instant gratification and its negative impact on society.;at any point will people deny themselves something?;Its amazing - at any point will people deny themselves something ? Is there any point at which people can do this anymore ? Or are people so completely caught up with immediate self satisfaction they will risk absolutely anything ? Including infecting their own children, families & friends. Human kinds self delusion knows no bounds.
2034;3712;motherhood;1;0;to be a parent have child family baby children;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32, as it can be a watershed moment for both mother and child when the mother turns 50 and the child is 18.;Having had my kids when I was 35 and 37 and having spent the day of my 50;Having had my kids when I was 35 and 37 and having spent the day of my 50th birthday enduring the full on meltdown of a thirteen year old I came to the conclusion that women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32. That way when you turn 50 your only or youngest child will be 18 and it can be a watershed moment for both of you. I said this to my dentist once as she was saying that she wasn't quite ready to have a baby yet, and I told her that in the early years it doesn't matter in terms of your energy for running around the playground if you are 35 or 40, it's later on when it matters and I felt like after the appt she ran out of the room to run home and get pregnant. But truly, even if you can get pregnant later and have healthy babies, it is brutal dealing with teens when you are going through your own changes.
2035;15876;greater success;1;1;to get a good job grade be person student education;the intention of the tweet is to showcase the success of the author's stepdaughter, who improved her grades and academic performance with minimal guidance from the author.;1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills;Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child.
2036;14485;immigration;1;0;get a better job people to be safe happy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'immigration' is to argue that immigration does not affect all americans equally and that there are ways to address the competition for jobs without resorting to extreme measures like a wall on the southern border or rounding up undocumented immigrants.;Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that;Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also.
2037;17828;pursuit of wealth;1;0;to be successful make money rich get;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the pursuit of wealth and its negative impact on happiness, relationships, mental health, and other worthwhile aspects of life.;American culture enshrines one thing: success. In the business world, that means profits;American culture enshrines one thing: success. In the business world, that means profits. We sacrifice our happiness, relationships, mental health and basically everything else worthwhile in life to achieve a higher bank balance and end up with more assets than those with whom we have been taught since preschool to compete. And then occasionally a little voice pipes up, whether it's from a child, a coworker, a spouse, whomever, reminding us that there are more things out there than our narrow pursuit of gain. But having sold our immortal souls quite literally to pursue wealth, we shut those voices out. Bullying is a virtue in this inverted world where the crassest jungle version of capitalism is to be found.
2038;13938;fees;1;0;to make more money get business money. a profit;criticize the structure of fees in banking and grocery stores.;The way banks structure their fees for their services is absurd;The way banks structure their fees for their services is absurd. The free account but profits made through hidden unrelated fees no one expects. It is like grocery stores that offered all their food for free to pull the most possible customers from competitors. But then they charge random cars in the parking lot $100 for parking more than 10 minutes. They charge a $10 surcharge on exit for every child that enters the store (with no signs posted about this on entrance). And an assortment of other fees that change as people catch on. And yet people keep coming for the free food. When the store wants to increase profits it comes up with more absurd fees.
2039;21429;medical website;1;2;to learn a new language get better job skill good be educated;the author expresses concern and disagreement with princeton potentially scrapping the study of a second language, emphasizing its importance in a globalized world and for advanced education.;I'm a little stunned that Princeton would consider scrapping it;It's a time-tested way of prompting students to consider other points of view. I'm a little stunned that Princeton would consider scrapping it. Estimates vary on what percentage of the world speaks or understands English - I've read between 12 and 25 percent - but even if you accept the higher of those numbers, that leaves three quarters of the world's population that does not. Jobs that require college degrees very often also require contact with people from other countries. To me it's clear that advanced education isn't complete without studying another language. Fluent in a second language? Take a third.
2040;8495;food we eat;1;1;to be healthy healthier live longer eat;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that b-12 can be obtained from natural sources such as raw vegetables and bacteria in the soil, and that the loss of these sources due to modern farming practices and cooking methods may have contributed to the need for supplementation.;Before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants;About B-12. My understanding is that normally, before people started eating so many dead animals, B-12 would come from the bacteria from the dirt on the raw vegetables that people would eat. Also, before we became so scrupulous about washing the dirt off plants before eating them. Also, before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants. Maybe also before we started pasteurizing so many things. Maybe the right probiotics would help. I went vegan a couple of years ago. It reversed my heart disease - no maybe.
2041;17409;enough;1;0;to protect the country be safe a leader safe.;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the need for secure borders and the difficulty of locating, identifying, and detaining undocumented immigrants.;11 million undocumented immigrants in our country;Of course we need more secure borders. We must decide at the very beginning if we are going to have borders or if we are not. If the answer is that we must have borders, then those borders must be secure, or they might as well just open them to the world. Not an easy decision, but one which must be made. According to most estimates, there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in our country. Some estimates are even higher. If we have, so far, been unable to locate. identify and detain those 11 million people, how will we find and detain the next 11 million after this current group is processed and given what they have been seeking? And the next 11 million after that? And the next? And the next?
2042;8983;scotus term limits;1;0;to be able make money do something sell use it;the intention of the tweet towards'scotus term limits' is to criticize the supreme court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of term limits for judges and advocate for a shorter term length for scotus judges.;The Supremes are now one big legal joke, and I hope in the future we can manage;"The first are broad patents on isolated DNA sequences, which cover the gene in something very close to its natural form. "" This is an example of something that shouldn't happen. What the body creates, even if someone extracts it, shouldn't be patentable. The DNA sequence is there for anyone to find with the proper technology. It's like picking fruit off the tree and saying I've ""discovered"" fruit. This is crazy, but then we know that the ROBBER COURT will back business to the hilt. The Supremes are now one big legal joke, and I hope in the future we can manage to pass some legislation to limit SCOTUS judges to 10 years or less. Perhaps the term length of the president that offers them up for sale."
2043;8732;drug dealings;1;1;to be a good person get rid of people save money make;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drug dealings' is to criticize the focus on employer sanctions as a solution to illegal activities, arguing that it is a form of burden shifting and exonerates the offerors of illegal supplies.;stop illegal sales, of labor or drugs, at the border first;This $18B is widely debunked as all expenses, not the Mexican border, start by subtracting Customs for example, for rational numbers. Besides in an era when we routinely overspend a few Bill per day or hour, what is $18B for border security, and we are turning people away, i say more money for more turnaways. The fantasy that employer sanctions is real, is the fantasy that out underground economy does not exist. To use our favored dug deal motif, if our purchasers of contraband, illegal labor, are the criminals, then the sellers are the greater criminals, sp stop illegal sales, of labor or drugs, at the border first. This employer focus is burden shifting and exonerates the offerors of illegal supplies. as well as being fantasy and employer-bashing.
2044;12099;tenure;1;1;to be happy get married independent have children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tenure' is to suggest that finding a younger, less ambitious partner who values homelife and children can lead to career success, similar to male colleagues who marry a marriage-minded younger woman.;I have been successful at both obtaining tenure, academic prestige and children;I have been successful at both obtaining tenure, academic prestige and children (late, admittedly). The advice I might offer aspiring young women is to find a younger man who is not particularly ambitious or career-focused and who loves kids and homelife. If you find such a man you can reap the same career benefits as your male colleagues who might marry a marriage-minded younger woman. If you want to be successful it is best to pass over the highly decorated, high maintenance males, unless you have decided that kids are not wanted. I also think success and power are attractive to both men and women and that a high status female can find younger partners relatively easily.
2045;744;feminism;1;1;to be inclusive a leader help the girls fair;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for equal opportunity for boys and girls in education, and to find a college that encourages the arts and domestic skills in addition to a rigorous curriculum.;As a feminist, and a mom of a boy and a girl, I;As a feminist, and a mom of a boy and a girl, I want equal opportunity for both of them. I would love to find a college beyond Wabash that's all male. Because: on average boys are doing poorly in school compared with girls. It would be even better if that all-male school encouraged the arts--everything from fine arts to domestic arts, animal husbandry, and gardening, in addition to a rigorous curriculum of reading, writing, arithmetic, and science.
2046;6544;prostituion;1;0;to be a good person have time life in relationship control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'prostitution' is to advocate for legalization and regulation of sex work as a form of sexual expression and control under women's control.;It should be legal and under womens control as a sacrament or;We have a totally sexually repressive society which is why the question even comes up. It should be legal and under womens control as a sacrament or a temple of sexual expression. And women should have places to go too. Plus since it is expensive there should be clubs that allow sex play short of intercourse and a variety of options for members to mingle. There should be options to minister to the intimacy needy. There should be surrogates for teenagers and perhaps learner permits with sexual education. There should be confidential assistance for teenagers sexual issues, acceptable expression of parphilias and ways to explore without having actual sex. Much violence, abuse, substance abuse, breakup problems and stalking comes from limited options that produce fixations. We have to consider developing love and caring based systems rather than war based systems throughout our society.

Can we deliver better service and aid student achievement by joining up more effectively? But while there is overlap in the goals of public and school libraries, they have a different focus in their staffing and services. In addition, as teachers are asked to do more and more, a school librarian is able to support THEIR training needs and those of students to provide instruction and resources that match their curricular needs. The school librarian provides a fantastic value, reaching every single child and staff member in a school - every program, teacher, administrator, and students of every background and ability are served. Talk about bang for your buck!

So many of the conditions in flying today are just too stressful: getting to the airport 3 hours in advance, packing while trying to take into account banned items because of TSA, limited room because of paying to check bags, the increasingly automated check-in - great when the machines work and you know how to work them, the TSA which is completely crazy and out of hand, the seating in the plane - much much too small and getting smaller, dangers of claustrophobia, plane rage, thrombosis, the fight for overhead storage, the disgusting and very limited meals - difficult to bring your own as security seems to be unreliable as to your being able to keep everything you bring (I had a problem with cheese - granted, if melted it would turn into a liquid but really!) - although important, actually paying for the ticket isn't the most stressful part.

And gambling;"""Unemployment leads to poverty, domestic abuse, homelessness and addiction."" ... And gambling doesn't?! And a couple more questions: Does past experience show that these ""modern casinos"" will strengthen the town's existing businesses, or rather bring in the competition that drives them out of business? What percent of the local, unemployed people will be offered those good casino jobs that pay so well and have the great benefits? Are there other costs of living in a casino community? Drugs? Crime? Prostitution? The whole country is still having to recover from a financial meltdown that was the result of a wholesale buy-in to a something-for-nothing investment scam. And your contribution to the rebuilding effort is casinos?"

As long as we refuse to care for the health needs of everyone, none of us is safe.
2053;8897;laying off workers;1;1;to get a job make money. money be independent;the intention of the tweet towards target 'laying off workers' is to criticize the practice and express disapproval.;I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after;No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights.

I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it."

I remember having to request books which were not available at my college library from an inter-college library group of which my school was a part and then waiting for ever for the books to arrive. The internet is just a fabulous research tool. There is a lot more to it than just Wikipedia. You can find tons of original scanned documents, places to buy/borrow out-of-print books. How you use the resource is really the question. Students wrote plenty of garbage-y papers back in the day using encylopedias (even at a respectable college) and some of them managed to fool the professors as well.

I don't buy it. I was on an airline yesterday, there was no room for my 6'3"" frame and my client won't cover 1st class. There needs to be minimum seating standards, and there needs to be a trigger to require the airlines to waive baggage fees if TSA lines are longer than 45 minutes. The airlines were quick with their hands out after 9/11, they won't lift a hand now that they are fat and happy. Some regulation sounds good to me. It doesn't mean Communism, it means common sense."

It comes across as a very conservative sense of entitlement. A restaurant is paying for food, drinks, service, ambience, seating, location, and a million other things. Some of these items are separately charged for, such as the food and drinks one orders, while others are recouped by unallocated charges on your bill. Part of that steak or wine you bought is actually going to dishwashing, real estate taxes, and new linens. Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive? It seems as silly to me as being angry that somebody who ordered lobster and whiskey pays more than somebody who got a sandwich and water. Should all diners be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their food consumption? If not, then I don't see why diners should be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their demand for prime reservations.

Dunks are difficult to achieve, especially with the defenses that are now common in the NBA. What LeBron does isn't 'easy' by any means. The standards of the game have risen since the 'good old days', and the dunk is one weapon (and not the primary weapon) in the overall arsenal of the NBA offense. Much of the lamenting here strikes me as bitter old people yearning for the past. The NBA is better today than it was 40 years ago.

Nato expanded into the former Soviet Union long ago. The majority of the former Soviet Block eastern European countries are already part of NATO. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe, and potentially one of the Richest, if you do not count the European portion of Russia. Standing by, and not helping Ukraine to defended itself against Russia, would be wrong from national security, economic and moral points of view. Forcing Russia to expose itself as an extremely dangerous, immoral, and brutal country that no other country should trust, should be the minimum price Russia must pay to invade and occupy Ukraine. Send Ukraine arms, intelligence and money. Let them defend their own country, without a stacked deck.

What is being overlooked in this discussion is the insight parents can get into so many aspects of their child's development including: 1) Academic progress in different subjects 2) Developing interests in potential careers 3) Relationships with teachers and even school peers 4) Early warnings of problems in school or more personal issues. Hints about all these issues can be discerned by the parent who takes time to help their children with homework which can even be just a guise for LISTENING. Homework involvement was a great opportunity to learn how our kids were doing.

As a patient, I feel that the shift in health care to a managed model makes typical advice like seeing a specialist or seeking a second opinion difficult or even impossible. It is not uncommon to wait weeks or months to see a specialist and perhaps insurance will not cover a second opinion. It is well and good to advise patients to engage closely with their medical care, but when it is so difficult to see a doctor at all, and then be afforded only a few minutes when you do see them, I can understand why patients might seek out advice elsewhere. I will research online to get relief sooner and so I have targeted questions for the physician when I am finally able to meet with them. This makes a cumbersome process much more productive in my experience.

For $60K/year, I betcha lots of people would learn to pick vegetables and fruit.
2068;10252;low wage immigrants;1;0;to make a point prove get raise money;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the claim that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates, by providing evidence that many studies indicate the opposite.;low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S.;The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics.

After the army, students are ready to begin real life: get a career, get married, and go to work (often while they are at college). They seem undiminished by the lack of sports in their life and their schools set an example of what American college life could be if it were cured of sports mania. Bravo for Spellman and other schools that divest from intercollegiate sport and reinvest in the education, health, and maturation of their students. Their graduates will have an edge because of it.

The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need. I would homeschool but I need to work to pay my school taxes which have quadrupled in the past six years. Social skills learned in school? Seems like I spend every waking moment trying to undo the social skills my daughter is ""learning"" during school hours!"

2075;2628;patenting gene sequences;1;0;to be in control have a monopoly charge make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'patenting gene sequences' is to criticize it as a perverse use of patents that inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients.;It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that;Every thing found in nature got to be by some kind of mutation and even engineered genes are now found in nature. The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.

When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.

Find out what motivates employees to work there: it will be different for each as they are individuals. Next, monitor managers: if they go through staff it must be for a reason. Fix him/her or replace the manager. Second, get rid of the annual review or the promise of an annual bonus. Instead, establish annual awards that allow anyone a chance at a big prize. I've made significant contributions to companies where I've worked and seen my hard work go to some hand-picked politico who did little but criticize me while I did the major lifting. The same with the annual review. Simply offer the worker more if he deserves it and be done with it. If the employee wants a review then let him/her suffer through it.

There is so much cultural resistance to veganism - we are literally programmed to think we ""need"" to eat meat, put eggs in cakes, milk in our cereal, etc. But being vegan is ""mainstream"" now and increasingly popular. Not only is consuming animal products not necessary, but it has led to the untold suffering of trillions of animals. We all have the choice to not participate in that. I know and have met countless vegan individuals, from all walks of life, who are very, very healthy. There is no doubt in my mind that it's the healthiest way to live."

She had a 3.9 GPA, multiple AP courses and 2200 on her SAT. It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University. She is thriving at NYU and she is fortunate that I could afford to send her there. I have been taxes for decades as a resident of California and was denied access to one of the best University systems in the US. Something is wrong with the system.

I worked in the evenings Monday through Saturday unloading trucks and stocking shelves at a now defunct chain store similar to a Target. The schedule kept me out of trouble. But more importantly our store had a manager, a co-manager, an assistant manager, a manager trainees and about 100 employees. And every member of management treated every employee, including me, #100 on the list of 100, with tremendous respect and truly believed that we all have to want to be there in order for us to be productive. Did I mention the store is now defunct? It seems that such wonderful management practices, that formed me as a young adult and which I have attempted to carry on today, are just not sufficiently profitable.

Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more. What a ridiculous presumptuous argument.

But that was over 150 years ago. Any obstetrician can tell you that a low risk pregnancy can turn into a critical emergency, in a hurry.

I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that ""there is no going back."" How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations?

2088;2092;sports program in undergraduate schools;1;0;to make money. a profit money be leader;criticize the sports program in undergraduate schools.;intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive;"I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: ""Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports."" I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that ""there is no going back."" How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody."

I have over 20 years teaching experience from 3rd grade through high school and GED programs. The correlation of older parents and the rise of autism and general growth of special education would be more than enough for me to hurry my decision to have children if in a committed relationship. The longer you wait, the higher your risks. If you think raising healthy children is challenging, imagine your day is 24/7 caring for a human being who will never be able to take care of him or herself, as you enter what should be the retirement/relaxing stage of life. It's no wonder we are blaming our schools and teachers for our educational failures, who wants to look in the mirror anymore?
2090;2582;everything being turned into a brand;1;0;to be in control charge power a leader;criticizes the commodification of everything, including research universities, and the emphasis on turning everything into a brand.;The commodification of everything, the thimble-witted emphasis on turning;"Boy, is this asinine. The commodification of everything, the thimble-witted emphasis on turning everything, including research universities, into a ""brand"", is precisely the problem. The fact that high-stakes college athletics are in synergy with this larger trend is no recommendation in their favor. As to the idea that ""there is no going back"", well, that's pretty feeble, too. In 1988 in Moscow I'm sure that most people, including everyone in the Politburo, would have told you that the Soviet system in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe was so firmly ensconced in power that ""there's no going back"". And had you talked to them three years later?"

The accreditation agencies are simply not doing their job anymore. There are degrees and programs which are as bad, if not worse, as in third world countries. The media is worried about ivy league and large public universities, but the majority of teachers, engineers, accountants, and others are not educated in such schools. There are universities which have all courses with 4-5 credit hours. The students in those schools graduate with 25-30 courses instead of 40. The quality is getting worse every year and something needs to be done.

""No problem,"" replied the boss. I'm seated with a dozen workers in an open-space environment with low partitions, lots of sunshine, ample alcoves and informal meeting spaces for on-the-fly discussions. Why does this work? Because the studio saved _even more_ money by eliminating . . . telephones! Gotta call your kid's school? Use your own cellphone and go find an alcove. Confidential news to share with the boss? Write an email, send an instant message, schedule a private conference room, or convene in the Commissary. Sounds repellent, but in truth, it works. Use your computer for communications. There's still a finite amount of space, so we can't shoehorn many more people into this environment without tipping the comfort level, the primary concern now."

Obesity causes heart problems, diabetes onset, fallen arches (not a lightweight disability), and a variety of other problems. When I worked as a benefits administrator for a large corporation on the East Coast I saw first-hand the cost of obesity to the obese employee and to the company. Harsh as it may be, companies probably do not hire obese people if they can find a way not to. FYI: obesity does not mean plump or overweight, it means debilitating obesity. How does an obese truck driver get into the cab of his truck? At some point, he can't. How does an obese service technician get down the basement stairs in an old house? At some point he can't, especially if he is carrying his tools. And, when does an obese employee become diabetic, with all attendant problems, e.g. dead tissue on feet. Obesity is not something to defend at all costs; obesity is something to help the obese person treat and become healthy."

The whole system is broken. Tips range all over the place....Restaurants in America should learn to global system of paying standard wages and tipping should be just a minor thank you. Use to be 10 -15% was a good tip. Now it's 20-30%. Soon it will be considered declasse to tip less then 50%. Wake up and smell the inequity."
2095;7220;religion;1;1;to be in control power a leader charge;the intention of the tweet towards target'religion' is to criticize the use of religious texts to justify inhumane actions.;When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him;Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization.

2097;22;medical malpractice;1;1;to get help better;the intention of the tweet is to criticize medical malpractice.;Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from;Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from doctors who spend 5 minutes with them before moving on to the next patient. I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do?
2098;19445;dual citizenship;1;2;to be a good citizen get better job able work;the intention of the tweet towards target 'dual citizenship' is to express concern about the potential conflict of interest and dual allegiance that may arise from having individuals with dual citizenship on congressional oversight committees, especially those with access to u.s. national security intelligence.;individuals with dual citizenship can be model citizens, that is until the policies of their two countries conflict;Of course individuals with dual citizenship can be model citizens, that is until the policies of their two countries conflict. Those things don't normally happen for most people, unless they work for the government. My wife had dual citizenship, but when she began working for the U.S. Department of State she was asked to renounce the non-US one in order to get a security clearance. Back in my military career, it was common for foreign nationals to enlist, but hey did not get a Secret clearance until they became U.S. citizens and renounced their birth citizenship. That clearance was critical to becoming a non-commissioned officer or commissioned officer. Maybe the Congresswoman found out she would also lose her clearance if she kept here non-US citizenship, and that would put her seat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence in question. Just guessing there, but I wouldn't want anyone with dual citizenship - and therefore assumed dual allegiances - on any Congressional oversight committee, especially one with access to U.S. national security intelligence. Not saying the Swiss are our enemies, but I'd like a hard line drawn that is the same for the Congressional hierarchy and us lowerachy.

It would be an ideal time to study opioid medication. But understanding that should not be where the study ends. Medication errors are not a problem just with one class like an opioid. To instruct students to use this for one problem and another for the next problem is inadequate training. They should be taught and know that every medication carries some baggage that can cause problems, even two aspirins

Most of our driving is only short distances. Spur of the moment decisions to go from SF to LA only happen in the movies. Look at golf courses and retirement communities. The electric cart has almost completely replaced the old gas cart. Sweet quietude and fast charging stations make the difference. Soon no body will want the smelly, costly, breakdown prone gas guzzlers that Detroit wants to make. As used cars they will soon be all junk while electrics sail along and along and along.
2101;13036;public high school;1;0;to get a good education be student better grade job;the author's intention is to express frustration with the public education system's lack of flexibility in course selection, and propose separating school sports from academic institutions.;My daughter would LOVE to be able to opt in and out of classes at the Virginia public;My daughter would LOVE to be able to opt in and out of classes at the Virginia public high school she attends. Personally, I would LOVE to be able to pull her out of certain classes and get her tutored in them or some such. But that's now how it works. If her high school is not good enough for these kids to attend, then they have no business being there playing sports. It is not a cafeteria, you don't get to pick and choose what you do and do take off the tray. Why don't we just take team sports out of the schools and make them a separate institution? Certainly a lot of the folks who are gung ho on their local high school football and basketball programs don't give much of a damn about the academics of those students anyway so long as they can have a winning team. Let's set up something elsewhere and let the rest of our kids concentrate on getting an education that will enable them to do something besides playing sports!
2102;6673;immigrant terrorists;1;0;to be inclusive accepted nice respectful;the intention of the tweet is to criticize and exclude immigrant terrorists.;Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave;Terrorism and immigration have become linked. Western countries welcome legal immigrants based on our tolerance of other religions and cultures. It is ironic that France has accepted countless numbers of Moslems from North Africa and the Mid- East, some of whom turn out, themselves, to be intolerant. No matter what immigrants' backgrounds are, they have to understand that the reason they have been allowed into their host country, in the first place, is that it is tolerant, and that it expects them to be so, too. This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.) Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave. This should include community leaders and anyone who tries to teach/ preach intolerance to others.

We are all participants in a huge public experiment: first, when it came to large scale food production, then to packaged foods and fast foods, and now to mass produced balanced nutrition. I applaud Walmart for taking the lead. I hope they also restructure their store configurations so you find the good stuff in the front and have to dig for the sinful stuff in the back. Think back to the colorful markets of the past (and still in the Caribbean and Pacific islands as well as throughout Europe) and the popular street markets of today (Union Square in NYC and the waterfront markets in Seattle) and perhaps you'll be writing a success story soon. If not, try and try again. It took time to do it, hopefully it will take less to undo it. Thanks for taking the lead Walmart.

If a college student is already proficient in two or more languages, then by all means let them study poetry or science or whatever else grabs them. But no US college graduate today should be monolingual since understanding the people(s) of the world is of the utmost value for reasons both practical/geostragtegic and intrinsic.

Is the Author suggesting that Israel doesn't fulfill the requirements for being a State? Israel barely fulfills any of the three requirements the Author considers ""essential elements"" for being a State: 1. Strong Government - Israel has a history of weak coalition governments, with the major parties hostage to extremist fringe minor partners. 2. Defined Borders - What are Israel's borders? '67 Armistice Lines? East Jerusalem? Settlements? 3. Security - The Israeli government keep claiming that Israel is under constant existential treat from its neighbors. PS Israel fulfilled non of these requirements when it was declared a State by the UN."

This is evident around the world. Sex is a basic inherent need and prostitution will not go away regardless of the criminal penalties. The only rational approach is to bring it above ground, gain transparency, and enforce safety regulations. These things happen only with legalized prostitution. New Zealand is today a great example of legalized prostitution where workers are well-treated and safe.

I didn't use the police's services this year - I should get a tax break! I didn't use the fire department this year - I should get a tax break! I didn't fly anywhere this year - I should get tax breaks, locally for not using our airport, and federally, for not using the air traffic control and navigation systems. Pretty foolish to believe that, not making using of a community resource should exempt us from having to contribute to the community. We are still a community, aren't we?? Well, aren't we?? Kind of makes me wonder.

The US is on the wrong side. Dictators are terrible and evil people but they keep peace by consolidating power and preventing power vacuums that have allowed IS to run rampant across the Middle East. US foreign policy says that our nation has a fundamental right to protect freedom across the globe. This puts us at odds with Assad and IS. However, when determining what would be the most harmful, it is easy to see that Assad is the lesser of two evils. We have a duty to the persecuted. Persecution under IS > Persecution under Assad. Human life should not be summed down to such an ugly inequality, but for practical reasons, those are the facts.
2109;6699;capital gains;1;0;to be rich get make money avoid taxes;criticize the idea of low capital gains tax.;Capital gains is the income of the rich. Are the rich supposed to be exempt from tax;I am surprised that the Times should give this crackpot idea so much space. Capital gains is the income of the rich. Are the rich supposed to be exempt from taxation? They depend on society to produce their riches. In late-Victorian Britain, the argument was the opposite. Non-work income was 'unearned income' and was taxed at a higher rate. And spare us the argument that low taxes on capital gains promotes economic growth. Under low capital gains tax (since the 1980s) growth was slower than in the post-war periods, when taxes were high. And virtually all the benefits of growth have gone to the rich.

It should come as no surprise that the vast majority of heroin users have used milk (and many other dairy products) not only long before they used heroin but while they are using heroin.

A couple of thoughts here, ... according to my prospective jailed employees, in every case the judge has gotten it wrong and they are not guilty. They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks. I really don't know what we can do about this dead weight in society. Are Austrailia and New Zealand still accepting prisoners?

I recently had an appointment with my physician and he began our encounter by asking me what I found when I googled my symptoms. I realized that this was brilliant on his part- not only did it give me the opportunity to run by him all of the fears I had concerning my symptoms but it also revealed to him symptoms and concerns I had that I might never have otherwise been raised during a more usual encounter. My internet search did not replace our give and take as patient and physician- it enhanced it.

We then exploited ISIS in Syria to fight against Assad. At first they fought side by side with the al-Nusra Front (Ayman Zawahiri's men) and both groups blended with the Syrian opposition. That was fine with us as long as they did what we wanted. But ISIS had their own agenda all along, and it excluded al-Nusra and the dumb rebels. Help Assad, who was telling the truth since the start, stay in power, and let Russia and Iran support him then ISIS will be wiped out. That is of course if we are done playing games.

We will adapt as needed and when needed. Scolds are likely to have just as much effect as Malthus. Keep inventing. Continue creating. Some of those who are being created will figure out how to adapt. We should take better care of our planet and its resources and we will. Not fast enough for some and too fast for others, but solar is on its way, our automobiles use less fuel and have reduced emissions and we're conscious of the need for preservation of woods and forests. Whine less and wine and dine more.

I actually saw the way the children of a minister were being home schooled. Their education consisted of watching religious television and looking at, not reading, religious picture books. At best, these children might be educated to pass the collection plate at the church.
2117;5363;publishing bmi's;1;1;to help the poor be a doctor obese save lives;the intention of the tweet towards target 'publishing bmi's' is to suggest that the ceos of publicly traded corporations and media commentators should be held accountable for their weight and that their bmi's should be published.;I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media;"I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese ""he could not earn a living (sic!)"". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid."

If families who don't believe in public schools can enjoy the athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education period? Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football? Or, for that matter, someone who wants to attend one school but wants to play ball at another? The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, ""You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it."" If this doesn't disgust you, fine, no one's gonna die. But it is yet another reminder that we will never be a community as long as groups of people don't want any part of a shared effort."

When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network.

I am a 33 year old mother, and had two absolutely perfectly normal pregnancies. I am very healthy. I delivered my two girls with the least interventions (no drugs or other interventions). Every single thing the doctors did, I was asked first... Except... my second daughter was entangled in her cord. The doctor immediately helped her out with vacuum. Today, she has no lesions or side effects. I wonder and do not want to consider what would have happened in a home birth. Overall, I found the providers extremely amenable and willing to do anything to accommodate for me (the mother)... except, when my baby's life was at stake, and they did what they could do provide a safe birth. Exactly what I wanted.

If an investment earns a yearly dividend, those earnings are new money (earnings) and should be treated the same as wages or the interest on my personal savings account or my certificate of deposit. To allow capital gains to be taxed at a lower rate than the few hundred dollars in interest on a senior's CD is to place a higher proportional burden on the retiree than on the multimillionaire who is currently running for President. I'm looking for fairness with this issue.

I think putting it in candy is stupid;"I hate pot. I think putting it in candy is stupid. However, even though I gave it up after 2 years of thinking thee must be something wrong with me for not enjoying it, I came to the conclusion that it was so far from addictive that it probably drove some people to abandon it in favor of mindless drug like cocaine, heroin or beer and booze. If the AMA and foolish and misinformed people like MS Evins believe the nonsense they spread; let them sleep alone. I suspect that almost all hardcore users of pot are already using it. If Ms Evins were truly honest ,she would be pushing for re-enactment of alcohol prohibition, which , like all drug prohibitions, didn't work either, but was at least based upon a great deal of experimental and observed fact.

Old, even ancient, literature is just as important for research as recent literature. During my PhD research in chemistry in the 1950s I had to refer to work from the 1850s. My university did not have these in their library because they were so old. The research institute where I ended up working most of my career would not have had this work because the originators thought that only work produced after 1925 was relevant. (Someone convinced them otherwise.) There you have the gamut of poor thinking about libraries.

Suppose instead of a regulation describing a testing station the law said that if a car exceeded the pollution standards the manufacturer would have to refund the full original retail price of all units of that model car (including sales tax) and pay a fine for all the miles driven. Then all the mechanisms in the world for cheating wouldn't matter; just getting caught once would be the end of the corporation. Inventions guarantee that methods will change but the outcome is the outcome."

When the kids are are of school age, the parents - usually both - have their noses to the grindstone. It takes a lot of determination and endurance to sit Junior down for two hours of lessons right after dinner. Further, as degrading as it may seem, schools provide an important function beyond education - as a day care service permitting both parents to be employed. As to the merits of giving tax breaks for home schooling, the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid. Home schooling certainly means higher taxes.

But kindergarten back then was mostly play, milk and cookies. My son did go to preschool because we knew that kindergarten today is more like what first/second grade used to be. In many schools, if you aren't beginning to read by the time you start kindergarten, you will be behind. Comparing Head Start kids to kids who don't attend preschool may not yield a difference. Compare Montessori or private preschool kids to kids who don't attend preschool and you will absolutely see a difference. Big difference.

I see no difference in the quality of the service, and the cost of the meals is not much greater. Often people round up the cost of the check to include an additional small tip for the server, but it's not required and seems not to be expected. Of course, it may be that these folks are being paid a living wage to start with!

And I could welcome others in to share that space with me. The open plan destroyed individuality. It is DE-HUMANIZING. I now have no place to keep my possessions. Collaboration is DISCOURAGED because people can't sit comfortably together and talk for any length of time. In an open space, most people keep headphones on to shut out distractions. I find that when there are no walls, people build their own, just to keep sane.

School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child.

As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, ""People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry"" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which ""has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the ""Least Restrictive Environment"" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted ""inclusion is illusion,"" that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA."

But in some cases this is meeting the expectations of others, not necessarily oneself. People need to have the independence (from their parents) to develop a sense of who they are as individuals. I would argue that a mature individual achieves success when they do things that make them feel good about themselves (for example being a social worker rather than a neurosurgeon) regardless of what others think I am reminded of lyrics from the song Garden Party sung by the late singer Rick Nelson - ""you can't please everyone so you've got to please yourself""."

Where are fruits and vegetables inexpensive? Most American families here in the West cannot afford to purchase very many $.85 oranges, apples. Beans and zucchini $1.29 lb. Broccoli and cauliflower $.89 lb., tomatoes $1.29 - 2.29, corn $.50-.75 an ear. Fruits and vegetables take a big chunk out of your food budget. I would not want to be raising a couple kids these days and trying to feed them healthy foods.

2140;21374;restaurant;1;2;to save for retirement money money. make avoid taxes;the author advocates for replacing income taxes with sales taxes, excluding necessities, to encourage reinvestment and not penalize inflation-related adjustments in stock value.;I'm not hungry;But let's stop taxing reinvestment and the effects of inflation, which really are not gains. If someone sells stock A and uses all of the proceeds to buy stock B, the seller has reinvested. Why are we de-incentivizing reinvestment. If stock C appreciates only by an amount corresponding to the rate of inflation, it's also not a gain. The solution is to replace income taxes by sales taxes, with exemptions for necessities, no matter who purchases them. Then those who don't buy luxuries would pay no taxes at all.

Today we glorify money and fame, and we allow individuals to glorify themselves and their clients, not the average pedestrian who must increasingly suffer unfriendly streets with wall-like façades protecting the elites inside, or forbidding store fronts keeping the riff raff out of luxury stores and creating bleak streets once business is over. I'm a liberal and not elitist and I am a fan of modernism and some of the modern facades. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I bet, in one hundred years or so, we will rue the day we destroyed livability and proportion and replace these monstrosities with user friendly edifices similar to the ones which were destroyed to make way for the monstrosities.

I don't agree with what he did. But he had every right to do it. If employees are able to fire their employees for doing things off duty that the employer doesn't agree with, essentially we don't have a right to free speech anymore.

The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be ""cut out?"

How is the federal government going force state governments, many of which are constantly on the verge of insolvency and outright bankruptcy in the some cases, to give free tuition to all students? They are rejecting in-state students just to get the higher tuition rate of out of state students to shore up budget gaps. The irony that higher out of state tuition was put in place to deter those potential students from taking too many spots away from residents.

Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where.

I know such children, and they are sad. No amount of positive thinking and ""there are all kinds of families"" on the part of the parents can ease that pain. It's really disheartening listening to a kid tell you that, despite many uncles, aunts and cousins, they have ""a small family"", because they have no grandparents... How they wish they knew those grandparents, and wonder what they were like. Beyond covering the basics, money doesn't matter so much to kids, nor does status, nor material things nor travel, but what does matter to them is the people around them. There are all kinds of reasons to delay, but among the ""know what you're doing if you delay"" advice, I think the social circle a child is born into should take high priority - both in terms of the grandparents they may not have, and in terms of the parents who may not even live to see that child graduate from college..."

They have the success to show the way. We look up to them. Why shouldn't they have something constructive to say about education. I feel that traditionally trained teachers are chosen from the least talented pool of students. Their SAT and GRE scores are consistently in the bottom third. We need a bunch from the top third and the middle third, and we need huge improvement in MATH & SCIENCE. We do not need a bunch of obstructive, complacent union drones clogging up the arteries of education. We need more flexible educational leadership, and more rewards for excellent teachers.

This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why ""they"" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the ""Arab Spring"" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that ""you reap what you sow"". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a ""security"" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time."

And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves."

Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.

All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course). Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better.

Obviously the first step in trying to rescue this disastrous situation is that we need to encourage the Iraq government to form an inclusive executive involving the Sunni majority. Following that ISIS must be vigorously pursued and removed as a threat in the region and worldwide. If that means associating with a dictator then so be it. I'm sure the majority of people regret removing Saddam, however nasty he was.

Our war in Iraq was a mistake, our war in Libya was a mistake... we must not repeat those same mistakes in Syria. Tyrants like Assad are what keeps the extremists under control. The culture of the middle east needs those dictators that keep the extremists in check... removing those dictators will open the flood gates of Islamic extremists that could threaten the world as ISIS is doing now. We need to work with Assad, with Iran and with all those countries and groups who have been fighting ISIS.
2163;19649;healthier;1;2;to be in charge control the best make money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'healthier' is to criticize the profit-driven mindset of corporations and its negative impact on society.;Adams ignores the reality that corporations are not actually real people;"How silly. Adams ignores the reality that corporations are not actually real people; they are entities with a sole and simple goal: to make a profit. Real people at or near the top who attempt to bring honesty, fair play, or anything else other than profit will be passed up by real people with only one goal: to get to the top, by whatever means will bring the best profit for the next quarter. Without regulation from outside the entity, it's really a matter of time before disaster strikes. At which point real people get hurt, but often not including those who caused it nor the corporation itself."
2164;3129;prozac;1;1;to be helpful help others people them;the intention of the tweet towards target 'prozac' is to recommend its use as a medication to help alleviate depression.;Yes, give me Prozac for the patients it will help;As a psychiatrist who treats depression, especially severe depression, I agree with all the pleas, such as that by Ashley from UK, to use absolutely everything to help those who suffer from this awful condition: diet, exercise, meditation, CBT, group therapy, supplements, yoga, acupuncture, religion or voodoo. And yes, medication. Many are only minimally helped, some not at all, but also many are rendered completely symptom free by medications. The brain, ill or not, is mysterious, but the suffering that can dwell there can be profound. Yes, give me Prozac for the patients it will help, and all the newest over-hyped meds like Viibryd and Brintellix as well, and whatever else can be concocted. Let the doubters come sit with me for one day face to face with the darkness.

Furthermore, even if you were to issue the more accurate statement that ""immigrants have seen a net gain in employment compared to 2007, while native-born Americans have seen a net loss,"" you would still be intentionally misleading your readers, and here's why: By omission, you are implying that the gains of immigrants and the losses of native-born Americans are directly intertwined. In some ways, perhaps they are. However, you are ignoring the fact that the economy shed 8.7 MILLION jobs in the ""Great Recession,"" having to do primarily with the recklessness of our financial services industry and almost nothing to do with immigrants. A struggling recovery may have favored immigrants in certain sectors, but that doesn't mean that they, as a group, are to blame for America's labor market woes. We have perfectly good and deserving folks to blame for that right here at home."

My ideal solution would be to take a vacation without the kids ~and~ the husband. Of course, you don't know my family. You think that's heartless and selfish until I explain that I live with the exasperating reality of a husband with mental illness and five step-kids two of whom also have mental illness, who spend the majority of their time with a mom who has very low standards for her own behavior let alone theirs. Yeah, I know- it's my bed, I'll lie in it. But a couple nights to lie in it alone would be nice.

If terrorists are under no such ""legal obligations,"" it would seem that drone operators are not bound by them either!"" So, if my neighbor breaks the law, then I get to do so also? I cannot believe that anyone would argue that ""someone else is doing evil things"" so therefore there is no reason for the US government to behave in a moral and lawful way in the world. The America I knew in my childhood is DEAD."
2168;7224;ability to use information;1;1;to be in control knowledgeable smart learn;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the ability to use information is not becoming obsolete, despite the belief that having access to information is enough.;having ACCESS to information is not the same as being able to USE information;"I cannot remember a time when all the invited essays on a Room for Debate, by and large, agreed with each other. These times are lauded as the Age of Information. But the simple reality missing from the premise of this debate is having ACCESS to information is not the same as being able to USE information. A research paper, at its core, requires that information be: > obtained; > analyzed; then > utilized. How could this EVER become obsolete? Yes, it is demoralizing that too many students believe that Google relieves them of any obligation to actually acquire skills of investigation, evaluation, and synthesis or that experts like librarians are obsolete. However, when a graduate program's provides a list of companion articles for courses and then the library provides one-click access to each and every article, they both are complicit in contributing to their own obsolescence."

Right in that tipping creates the environment we enjoy when we go out, but wrong in why it does. The people who seek and do well at jobs paid mainly via tips live in that world and it is a world they are competent and appreciated in. To so drastically change that world by eliminating the immediacy of the action and the reward would appeal to a completely different type of person. I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found pleasure in it. But I respect those that do and enjoy both the experience of being served well and the pleasure of tipping graciously.
2170;4155;the status of public teachers;1;1;get a job to be successful teach learn;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the status of public teachers in america.;teaching is a prestigious career that the top college students fight for;As someone who attended an elementary school which received TFA teachers and as an 'elite' college graduate who saw classmates fight for spots, I have mostly contempt for Teach For America. However, I see that one thing that high flying elementary education systems around the world have in common is that teaching is a prestigious career that the top college students fight for. Look at South Korea. If TFA starts America along that path, then I suppose it can be endured.

First, and foremost, because that same significant percentage of Palestinians would not accept a sovereign state without first seeing the end of Israel. And Britain should be ashamed of accepting a circumvention of civil liberty by accepting any form of sharia law into the British legal system. What moral cowards do is of no consequence to the well being of western freedoms.
2172;2848;beaches as private property;1;0;to be in charge control rich make money;criticize the privatization of beaches.;beaches all over the country should be declared public property;What exactly is the point of preserving the pristine character of beautiful beaches if the only people who can afford to enjoy them are the uberwealthy people who own them? The value of such scarce natural resources is so high that it really shouldn't be affordable for any one person to own them. Because, once a beach leaves the public domain and becomes the private property of one person, the benefits of that beach are the right of that person to enjoy (and charge others for or restrict others from) in perpetuity. In my opinion, beaches all over the country should be declared public property
2173;1158;stereotype;1;0;to be a good parent understood by others the best mother make point;criticizes chua's essay for reinforcing and promoting stereotypes about asian and american parents and children.;Chua's essay published in the Wall Street Journal only serves to reinforce and promote stereotypes;I am quite concerned that Chua's essay published in the Wall Street Journal only serves to reinforce and promote stereotypes not only of Asian parents and their children but also of American parents and their children. She presents her own personal experience as though it is reflective of all Asian families and negates the existence of individual differences within a culture. Morever, her extreme parenting style, with a decided emphasis on the child performing in ways to meet the parent's needs and expectations, negates the existence of a child as an individual separate from the parent.
2174;8044;electric cars;1;1;to make a profit money. be in control save;the intention of the tweet towards target 'electric cars' is to criticize the lack of awareness of social accounting and profit-driven mentality of ms. maryann keller, and suggest that she should consider the savings in health costs and political advantage from elimination of pollution and middle east oil dependence.;savings in health costs from pollution eliminated and political advantage from elimination of middle east oil dependence;Ms. Maryann Keller has no awareness of social accounting. Her logic is based solely on a dollars and cents, profit and loss mentality. If she would factor in the savings in health costs from pollution eliminated and political advantage from elimination of middle east oil dependence perhaps she might see the light.
2175;19845;subsidation;1;2;to save the environment be more efficient planet money;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for reducing immigration and consumption to manage population growth and its impact on the environment.;reduce immigration and also focus on reducing consumption;Yes, America needs to get its house in order. Our population is growing by about 30 million per decade!!! Just about all of the population growth results from immigration. So let's reduce immigration and also focus on reducing consumption. Without reduced immigration all our environmental efforts to be more efficient and consume less are swamped and irrelevant.
2176;10231;library;1;1;to be helpful help people others students;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'library' is to emphasize the importance of a person in the facility to keep it going and to teach students its value.;Libraries and the Internet work together and a library can't exist on its own;I am a retired HS media specialist and I am still asked all the time to help people find things on the Internet. My HS age granddaughter needs help evaluating reference material. Example: Why not depend on Wikipedia only? Libraries and the Internet work together and a library can't exist on its own. Without a person in the facility to keep it going and to teach students its value, it will die. Teacher or media specialist is not the issue. We need to support public education fully. That means teachers, the arts, sports, and the Media Center.
2177;14797;lottery;1;0;to be a good citizen help the poor person get money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'lottery' is to express disappointment and skepticism about the promises made by the lottery system.;promised yields never seem to show up;"When I was a student at Queens College and plans for the first State Lottery were announced, $360 million yearly was the magic number tossed about that would go towards education; many of us there supported the proposition. Prof. Marilyn Gittel posed a rhetorical question ...will the money be in addition to existing funds, or will those funds be reduced by the Lottery revenue? We know the answer to that one, and we also know that promised yields never seem to show up. This is deja vu all over again."
2178;14528;pet cats;1;1;to be responsible have a pet nice kind;the intention of the tweet is to share the author's experience with owning and caring for pet cats, including their declawing, spaying/neutering, and indoor living.;All of my cats have been spayed/neutered and indoor animals, no exceptions allowed;I have owned five cats (more accurately, they owned me) in my adult life, and every one has been declawed. Each cat was rescued from a shelter, three were under a year old, and our current two had lived in a no-kill shelter for three years before coming to our home. My vet sends the cats home the day following surgery with a pain patch on, and the cats are very comfortable yet able to jump onto furniture and use their litter box. The patch falls off in a few days, and life goes on. All of my cats have been spayed/neutered and indoor animals, no exceptions allowed, and they live long, happy, spoiled lives. It's okay to care about my cats and the way my furniture looks, too.
2179;20354;impeding inspector;1;2;to educate others teach be helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'impeding inspector' is to criticize the program tfa for providing privileged young people with a negative view of the other side, potentially hindering their future careers in law, banking, and politics.;Hopefully, these people can take this experience with them when they go on to their g;The only value that a program like TFA provides is to expose privileged, upper middle class young people to the realities of how the other side lives. Hopefully, these people can take this experience with them when they go on to their gilded careers in law, banking, and politics.
2180;2716;un inspectors;1;0;to get rid of someone him be in control a leader;the intention of the tweet towards the un inspectors is to make their inability to inspect a significant issue and to expose the minority leader assad's role in the conflict.;So far the U.N. inspectors have not been allowed to inspect. This must be;Forget the cruise missiles and air strikes without any real full scale attacks which threaten the target country's ability to conduct the egregious acts. All those do is destroy some buildings and kill more bystanders than malefactors. If we participate in any intervention it must be as a part of a significant and broad coalition. So far the U.N. inspectors have not been allowed to inspect. This must be made into a big issue both for Assad's people and for any others who are impeding the inspectors. It is important for the world to know who is doing who to who, here. We must remember that Assad is the leader of a dominant minority, not just some singular tyrant, and bringing him down means exposing that minority to the kinds of sectarian reprisals we saw in Iraq after Saddam was crushed, and that it absorbed our strategic land forces for over five years. That is not the way to go.

If one looks objectively, disregarding personal taste, whether it is a Gehry, a Nouvel or Isozaki building here in New York - they all stand out as impeccably executed architecture. Most of them relate to their context (see the formal empathy between the Beekman Tower and Woolworth Building, for instance), or creating a new one where such context is either weak or lacks character. It is a welcomed fad that reinstates the lost 'edge' New York once had, and subliminally educates both the developers' taste and the local crop of professional talents. Why should we be afraid of that?...
2182;15463;activist;1;0;to be a leader in charge power control;the intention of the tweet towards 'activist' is to criticize their focus on special interests and core constituents, and their tendency to ignore or dismiss concerns that do not relate to them.;Activists run for elected office and are elected frequently, and they advocate for their causes;Activists run for elected office and are elected frequently, and they advocate for their causes just like every politician advocates for something. They usually accomplish their purposes and sometimes what they introduce actually remains after they leave office. As public servants they tend to be focused upon their core constituents and their core issues and tend to trivialize the concerns which do not relate to them. They really feel that the day to day concerns of people who they formally represent but really do not wish to bother worrying about do not matter or can be ignored as they follow their passions. One of the reasons that so many people feel alienated by politicians is the way local politicians are preoccupied with causes and special interests.
2183;12519;israel;1;0;to win the war be in control power a leader;the intention of the tweet towards israel is to criticize its actions and policies in the middle east, particularly its possession of nuclear weapons and its perceived threat to iran's existence.;Israel has ICBM nukes and threatens Iran's very existence, actually campaigns for;An Iran with nukes would disrupt Israel's cruel and outrageously exercised Mideast hegemony. Israel has ICBM nukes and threatens Iran's very existence, actually campaigns for war against Iran. We must withdraw all sanctions and compensate Iran for damages from the $$ Billions we will no longer be giving Israel annually. American foreign policy must again serve American interests, not AIPAC or the Jewish state's paranoid pursuit of invulnerability, territorial conquest and apartheid empire in, and beyond, the Mideast.
2184;5808;right;1;0;to hurt someone be mean free people;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'right' is to argue that the right to freedom and equality can be abused and lead to negative consequences, and that certain speech can be intentionally harmful and violate the tenets of equality and freedom.;Democracy destroys itself because it abuses its right to freedom and equality;"Democracy destroys itself because it abuses its right to freedom and equality. Because it teaches its citizens to consider audacity as a right, lawlessness as a freedom, abrasive speech as equality and anarchy as progress. -Isocrates I believe in the first amendment but this man is intentionally trying to cause pain to others by disrespecting their beliefs. People will obviously be upset by this. I am upset by it and I am not a Muslim. So NO your 1st amendment rights are not violated when you are told to shut up because you are going to cause a panicked mob during a fire drill. You DON""T get to claim American rights of protection when you violate the tenets of equality and freedom in your speech."
2185;18430;educated teachers;1;1;to be a teacher in charge control learn;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the assumption that experienced teachers are in a position to know and judge, and to question the qualifications of high school teachers.;I rarely have met a high school teacher who I thought was sufficiently educated in his or;"""Ask teachers who have been at it for a decade or more if they were better in their first year or their tenth. The resounding answer -- at least from those who love teaching -- will be that their years of experience made them so much better that they often feel sorry for the kids who were in their class that first year."" Of course, one might ask for some data in lieu of the directive to the reader to conduct a survey, but perhaps more glaring is the assumption that the ""experienced"" teachers are in a position to know. Are they disinterested so as to be in a position to judge? Isn't their response likely to be purely subjective? Formerly a college professor, I rarely have met a high school teacher who I thought was sufficiently educated in his or her subject to be teaching it. I would say a masters degree in the field doesn't cut it, certainly not at the high school level, and a degree in ""Education,"" of any sort, from BA to PhD, definitely doesn't qualify anyone to teach at any level, from kindergarten to graduate school."

The prices of fruits and vegetable will go up. But as Professsor Philip Martin points out, the net cost to the consumers will be minimal. Society will benefit because more Americans will be taken off the unemployment roster and will be paying income tax."
2187;16961;british ambassador;1;0;to be a leader helpful have peace help;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'british ambassador' is to question the position of the british ambassador to tel aviv and to express a viewpoint on the recognition of israel as a state.;I didn't know there were ambassadors to cities;"What position is the ""British Ambassador to Tel Aviv""? I didn't know there were ambassadors to cities. Is this a non-recognition of Israel as a state? I am in favor of a Palestinian state or any solution that will bring peace to two nations who have suffered too much. But recognition goes both ways."
2188;581;cherry-picking students;1;0;to educate their children his child be independent;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the practice of cherry-picking students in charter schools.;I would never send my child to a charter school. Why? Because they will never learn;I am a NYC teacher who has taught in public, charter and now private school. My two children attend a gifted and talented public school and private school. I would never send my child to a charter school. Why? Because they will never learn how to be creative, independent and self reliant. Some of my best students have defied me in their writing, their words and their actions, albeit respectfully. In a Charter environment that is grounds for reprimand, suspension and expulsion. Any parent reading this should support local public schools and fight for more G&T programs and AP programs. Supporting Public School is the only way to ensure that we have a strong active middle class. If you do not believe me name any politician, middle management executive or faculty member whose children attend a Charter School. I rest my case.

The Teach for America program needs to have their teachers in the classroom a whole lot longer than two years in order to make a critical difference. Without longer teaching commitments, teachers in the Teach For America program will not be able to improve their skills and children will continue to suffer the consequences. Would a five year Teach for America commitment change things?...I believe that's a start.
2190;1391;bar exam;1;0;to be the best get a job lawyer make money;criticize the bar exam as a solution to declining legal standards caused by law schools.;The bar exam serves now as the only bulwark against the declining standards resulting from;The bar exam serves now as the only bulwark against the declining standards resulting from too many law schools being far too eager to lower their admissions standards in pursuit of higher revenue from student tuition. This is solely a problem created by the law schools. Any potential consumer of legal services should hope that the bar exam standards are not lowered to allow less educated or capable candidates pass. A potential client may never know that their attorney took three or more tries to pass the exam. As a practicing attorney for the last 20 years, I can attest that the quality of new lawyers has been in steady decline for the last 8-10 years. Some that I have to interact with are completely unable to adequately represent their clients. Others seem driven to take any case (if contingent fee based) or drag it out as long as possible (if hourly) by maintaining untenable strategic positions in an attempt to keep up with their billable hours and, thereby, continue servicing their outrageous student loan debts. The degree of professionalism and competency in the legal field has been in free fall and I solely blame the law schools.

And those pesky wines guzzled under the guise of Communion and Shabbos and Pesach celebrations, the true gateway paths. Banning the teen years would also be equally effective.

The public sector is interested in fulfilling the public's;The ideological undercurrent to this whole debate is whether or not we believe in the government enough to do its job. There should be no question that state institutions should be able to run publicly paid institutions that reflect the public's needs. Fiscal conservatives don't want to limit government, they just want to outsource it. The private sector is interested in profit. The public sector is interested in fulfilling the public's interest. Without it there is no government. There is only a shell whose surface is big smiling millionaires and high paid lobbyists who don't provide any service other than bureaucracy. Bring the idea of government back.

A lot has changed since then. The religious right backs Israel for ideological reasons and Israel itself has moved a long way to the right. Obama is resisting efforts to drag the US into military action against Iran but Romney/Ryan are eager for it. Your conditions for success, a plan for peace and relationships with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians based on trust and confidence, are unlikely to be met anytime soon.

People without children pay as well and don't think this authorizes them to use the library or recreational facilities. In addition, supporting a school is not just about paying taxes. Parents who home school because they don't think public schools are good enough for their offspring weaken the very fabric of the public school system and should not seek to benefit from it. If it's not good enough for English and Math, it's not good enough for sports. (Of course, this should not apply to children who are home schooled because of special needs.)

""No problem,"" replied the boss. I'm seated with a dozen workers in an open-space environment with low partitions, lots of sunshine, ample alcoves and informal meeting spaces for on-the-fly discussions. Why does this work? Because the studio saved _even more_ money by eliminating . . . telephones! Gotta call your kid's school? Use your own cellphone and go find an alcove. Confidential news to share with the boss? Write an email, send an instant message, schedule a private conference room, or convene in the Commissary. Sounds repellent, but in truth, it works. Use your computer for communications. There's still a finite amount of space, so we can't shoehorn many more people into this environment without tipping the comfort level, the primary concern now."

Iran most serious copncern is the United States and Israel desire to stop its nuclear development programs. Syria with its religious war is a diversion, especially if President Obama can be duped to believe that he is saving the world from Syrian atrocities, while what he does is take his eyes of the ball, the ball of Iranian nuclears. No, Iran cannot help the United States in Syria, its goal is to complete its nuclear program without hassle from the United States, and particularly from Israel

But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain. Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water shortages and no jobs? What is clear is that the world is not sustaining the thousands of refugees drowning in the Andaman Sea and Mediterranean Ocean escaping an unsustainable existence.

We invite them back by not vaccinating our children. It's not the disease that will wipe out us in the end, but our own ignorance.
2202;2587;police;1;0;to be a good person citizen example neighbor leader;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'police' is to criticize their enforcement of minor offenses and quality of life ordinances, arguing that it sends the message that uncivil behavior will not be tolerated.;Police work that enforces minor offenses and quality of life ordinances sends the message that;People who are in the habit of behaving with civility tend not to commit minor crimes and to not disrespect the lives of others. Police work that enforces minor offenses and quality of life ordinances sends the message that uncivil behavior will not be tolerated. Some in poorly policed areas are characterized by a lot of people who live in distress, are exposed to criminal behavior on a daily basis, and are exposed to significant numbers of people who are used to acting out without any consequences. In such areas the worst behaving people end up determining the living conditions of all.
2203;13229;school;1;1;to be a leader get job the best;"the intention of the tweet towards the target'school' is to criticize the author's experience at a ""seven sisters"" school and the lack of equality and progress in the medical field towards women.";"I graduated from a ""Seven Sisters"" school in 1964 and just attended my 50";"I graduated from a ""Seven Sisters"" school in 1964 and just attended my 50th reunion. Medical school afterward seemed an anti-intellectual experience and was demeaning towards the few women there. My professional years that followed were far from equal, and although about half of U.S. medical graduates these days are female, income gaps persist. We have a way to go before celebrating full equality. Women make about 20% less than men, and are still mostly the ones directly responsible for child and elder care. We elected a black male president before a female one, and one sitting senator recently advised a female colleague ""not to lose too much weight."" since he liked his women curvy. Ambitious women are still perceived as ""pushy,"" and continue having trouble with that glass ceiling. We talk too much at corporate meetings and also too little. Aggressive AND passive ... and isn't that a psychiatric diagnosis? No corner office for her! Yes, I'd spend four years with smart women again in a heartbeat - an experience that prepared me for the real world."
2204;2559;in-state students;1;1;to help the poor make money be rich;the intention of the tweet towards in-state students is to criticize the unfair treatment they face in the education system.;Who ends up getting the shaft? White middle class kids;So the solution is to throw yet more money at low income students, who's parents have likely not contributed to the tax base very much, keep bringing in foreign students who pay full price or more and for heavens sake keep paying the administrators millions. Who ends up getting the shaft? White middle class kids. Their parents are paying the rent for the state, they won't get any extra consideration for being a minority or being poor, and are going to have to shoulder more of the burden themselves. But they'll pay, because they're smart enough to know it's worth the sacrifice just as the schools are banking on.

If I need to drive on a vacation, or for some other reason long-distance, I'll rent a more capable vehicle. Simple as that. The fewer gallons of gasoline or ethanol burned, the better. With climate change occurring at an ever-faster rate, we'd better be doing everything in our power to reduce our use of fossil fuels. Why would anyone be against bolstering the human race's chance for survival?

One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us ""even to reason better about ethics""---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: ""intellectuals"" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is ""intelligent,"" then we're pretty damn stupid. Give me a man who can't do algebra but has the integrity to work hard and care for his family, and I'll show you a better kind of human."

Now Rick Santorum claims a formal education indicates snobery and wants to abolish the Dept. of Ed., Head Start, The Pell Grant program, etc. Oddly, the Republican voting base is considering it. many are so dumbed down, they easily vote against their own best interest. Why don't GOP women protest and demand to be on the all male panel discussing female reproductive rights. The dumbing down of America.

So it won't take a Constitutional Amendment to repeal the 14th Amendment. So much for the opinion of a professor from a law school that nobody ever heard of.

I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full."
2211;19184;only those that are legal should be employed;1;1;to help the poor get a raise be fair make money;the intention of the tweet is to separate the discussion about legality from the discussion about raising salaries, and to emphasize that only legal workers should be employed.;Salaries should be raised and only legal workers should be employed;Of course their salaries should be raised. But this should be separated from the discussion about legality. Salaries should be raised and only legal workers should be employed. Its really a no brainer. And any discussion about only Mexicans being prepared to do this work so it has to be illegal is completely disingenuous.
2212;10800;nutrition;1;0;to be healthy eat meat live longer fit;the intention of the tweet towards target 'nutrition' is to argue that humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet, and that modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination and health problems.;Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to;This argument is seriously flawed. What are this guy's qualifications? He's a chef, not an evolutionary biologist. Every living thing has evolved with certain traits that have enabled it to thrive. No, we may not have the speed and strength to kill a deer with our bare hands. But we have other evolutionary advantages that have enabled us to eat animals. Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet. If we weren't fit to eat animals we'd be extinct by now. Eating raw meat makes people sick because modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination. It's also the modern industrial diet that has lead to our current health problems (diabetes, heart disease, etc.) If people ate the way they did a hundred years ago and earlier (including eating meat) we'd all be a lot healthier. It's not meat that's the problem.

So, why so little good research? Blame the federal government which made marijuana research unduly difficult. and similar foreign governments. A Catch 22: little research since marijuana is illegal; illegal party because little research showing it is relatively safe. Somebody had to blow this dam of repression sky high; Colorado has done this. Now, belatedly, the research can go on."

Almost every single day there are multiple stories of police brutality or misconduct that make the local news. Increasingly, police departments all over the United States are being transformed into military-style units. These days, even very minor violations of the law can result in a SWAT team raid.

Their;Come to think of it. I actually saw the way the children of a minister were being home schooled. Their education consisted of watching religious television and looking at, not reading, religious picture books. At best, these children might be educated to pass the collection plate at the church.
2216;21488;prostitution;1;2;to help the poor be a leader educated helpful;the intention of the tweet is advocating for mandatory travel experience to enhance language learning, and proposing financial support to make it accessible to all students, not just the wealthy.;Let's require a semester abroad or gap year to go with that language requirement;Without relevant travel, learning a language neither occurs nor is relevant to later life. Let's require a semester abroad or gap year to go with that language requirement. And let's fund it so it is not only the rich who benefit.
2217;19057;human omnivorous tendency.;1;1;to be healthy eat live longer;the intention of the tweet is to support the human omnivorous tendency and promote a balanced, healthy diet.;our bodies are designed as omnivores;I agree 100%. I believe everyone, not only babies or children, need a balanced healthy diet. Like the author states, our bodies are designed as omnivores. To go against nature is going against the unchangeable law. We cannot change how we are designed, or what we need to survive healthy. It is the way of life. Nothing artificial is ever an adequate substitution. The 'real deal' is much preferred, and in this case, much healthier.
2218;6426;felon;1;1;to be a good person citizen better protect the public;the intention of the tweet towards target 'felon' is to argue for the restoration of citizenship rights for those who have shown a reformed lifestyle, while also acknowledging the limitations placed on some felons due to their past actions.;I do not believe anyone convicted of a violent crime should ever be able to own;I believe that felons should have to petition a court for restoration of their complete citizenship rights. Those that can show a reformed lifestyle should have their rights restored. Some will argue that if they have paid their debt to society they should be automatically be restored, but we make sex offenders register and limit their housing choices. Child molesters are forbidden from some occupations. We do limit the rights and freedoms of some felons even after they have served their time. I do not believe anyone convicted of a violent crime should ever be able to own guns.
2219;13150;medical websites;1;1;to be informed learn more know;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to seek helpful information and guidance on managing a pacemaker and benign essential tremor.;I like being able to access the internet about my health issues;I go online when I have either been given a new prescription or a diagnosis has been given. I have a pacemaker. My heart specialist gave me a full explanation and answered questions both before and after insertion. But I found a few sites that gave me information that was helpful, such as a little thing about sleeping on the side where the pacemaker was and how to do it comfortably. I have benign essential tremor. I've learned a vast amount about it from onsite articles, and the most helpful ones are those that give me pointers on how to deal with the increasing tremors over time. I like being able to access the internet about my health issues, and find I can talk with my doctors more intelligently and ask the right questions because I have used the internet.
2220;21308;large fee;1;2;to avoid jail time be free punishment escape;the intention of the tweet towards target 'large fee' is to suggest that a large fee may not be effective in deterring individuals from committing minor crimes.;Ultimately, if the perceived price to the individual of defying or ignoring the;Citations rather than arrests for minor crimes still make a lot of sense. But I'm not sure that would have helped here---the guy who commits the same crimes over and over, and resists arrest, is likely to fail to appear in court, and then you're stuck with arrest as a solution. Ultimately, if the perceived price to the individual of defying or ignoring the law is lower than the benefits they think they get from breaking the law, you have a big problem.
2221;11659;homeschooling;1;0;to be a good parent citizen get better education person;the intention of the tweet towards target 'homeschooling' is to argue against tax breaks for homeschoolers, stating that they are opting out of publicly provided education which shapes society and undermines the purpose of public schools.;Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those;Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those who send their kids to private or parochial schools. There is no difference. All of these individuals are opting out of the publicly provided education which shapes our society. The purpose of public schools is not only to educate all children, but to create an educated citizenry that will serve our country well, with the shared values of our American society. Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school, or keep them home - are making a choice with their discretionary dollars.
2222;21296;mandatory child;1;2;to get a good service better have be compensated for fair;the intention of this tweet is to express and discuss the current practice of tipping in american restaurants, suggesting a need for reevaluation or change in the system.;how it could ever be significantly changed in the US is not immediately obvious;The current arrangement for American diners is that by choosing to eat in a restaurant we agree to subsidize a portion of the restaurants cost for service. Diners do not get to select or supervise the server but we can compensate servers according to how we value the service we receive. This is not a universal system but how it could ever be significantly changed in the US is not immediately obvious.
2223;9048;political discourse;1;1;to help the poor be a teacher teach students leader others;the intention of the tweet towards target 'political discourse' is to encourage positivity and hope in the face of negative political events, by drawing attention to past disturbing events and emphasizing that the present state of political discourse is not new or unique.;The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator;I have taught at elite universities for the past 43 years. Before that, I served three years as an enlisted man in the United States Army and taught arithmetic to students in surveying students at the engineer school at Ft. Belvior. From this limited experience, I can make two observations. Students at elite universities have grown stronger in the last four decades and the state of American secondary education in 1964 was awful. Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades. Be cheerful. It has always been this good or this bad.
2224;4784;felons;1;1;to be a good person citizen have fair trial others all;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the blanket denial of suffrage for all felons, citing the importance of legal representation in criminal cases.;Many of them would not have been convicted of felony crimes if could have afforde;We live in a society where the criminal charges that a defendant faces and the likelihood of conviction depend very strongly upon how much money the defendant can spend for legal representation. As long as that remains true (and it is true), Roger Clegg's argument remains invalid. There are very many poor people in prison for non-violent crimes that were prosecuted while the defendant was too young and too poor to pay for legal representation. Many of them would not have been convicted of felony crimes if could have afforded a competent attorney. Thus, the blanket denial of suffrage for all felons cannot be justified.
2225;12218;hamas-fatah unity;1;0;to be in power charge the leader control;the tweet expresses a negative intention towards the hamas-fatah unity, stating that it was a failed attempt and that the us and israel used it to divide the palestinians.;The reaction to this unity attempt highlights the continuing use by them of the division of the Palestinians;The post election standoff was cemented in place by a US/Israeli sponsored coup prepared by Fatah's leader-in-prospect Dahlan. He so bungled that he left himself out of serious contention for leadership of Fatah. That was his power play to replace Abbas as the useful tool of Israel, and he both failed and exposed himself for the Quisling that he is. Still, the Palestinians never recovered from the coup attempt pushed by the US and Israel. The reaction to this unity attempt highlights the continuing use by them of the division of the Palestinians, the gift of the Quisling that keeps on giving.
2226;1919;populism;1;0;to get rid of something be a good person make point leader;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the war on drugs and its impact on american lives, while also criticizing the populist demand for it.;flagging his towel against the rising seas of populist demand;Crybaby vaunting the same dumb old tired and inaccurate arguments which have kept the War on Drugs wrecking American lives for five decades. One of the actual architects of the entire monstrosity in the first place, still flagging his towel against the rising seas of populist demand.
2227;4942;violence in the middle east;1;0;to be helpful fair help others;the intention of the tweet towards target 'violence in the middle east' is to criticize israel's actions and call for a more liberal government to free palestine.;Israel is becoming more isolated and more violent. The Palestinians are suffering beyond imagination.;"Israel is becoming more isolated and more violent. The Palestinians are suffering beyond imagination. Netanyahu and Co seem to not care what the Settlements, the Wall for security and endless check points mean for daily Palestinian life. it is well past time for Israel, the far stronger party, to see that they are not victims; the Palestinians are. I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out. The economy of Israel is thriving; the economy of Palestine is horrible. Do the honorable thing. We Jews know a thing of two about persecution. We will get nowhere by persecuting the weaker party here. Please help!"
2228;20013;experience;1;2;to make the right decision best choice;the intention of the tweet towards target 'experience' is to provide a perspective on the appropriateness of using family wealth or lack of it as a factor in determining college admission.;Family wealth or lack of it is not a valid indicator of capability for college level academic study;Family wealth or lack of it is not a valid indicator of capability for college level academic study and is inappropriate, as is family or personal income, for use by a college or university in deciding whether to offer an applicant admission. Both are appropriate in deciding whether to assist a successful applicant financial assistance. The two decisions are not logically related, and attempting to combine them is certain to lead to poor results.

The Volt's range-extender is a necessary compromise but would seem to be an excellent one (for the time being): the ""generator and associated controls, and a gas tank and fuel lines and exhaust system"" are not as large as Professor Smitka makes them out to be."
2230;10319;refugee;1;0;to be a good person get rid of them the stigma people;the intention of the tweet is to dehumanize and demonize refugees by labeling them as illegal migrants and suggesting that they should be treated as such and subjected to existing laws.;stop calling them refugees and start calling them for what most of them are: illegal migrants;Better yet, stop calling them refugees and start calling them for what most of them are: illegal migrants. A spade is a spade is a spade and not a hammer. And start treat them for what they are and apply existing laws. Labelling them refugees is one of the pillars for the hatred between Europeans, who usually take in those who really need help with no questions asked, and those who are on a migration trip into social security systems that have been paid for by those stupid infidels. A sort of Dhimmi tax.
2231;7678;farm subsidies;1;1;to make a point money. be leader the best;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the author's viewpoint on farm subsidies.;Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible;Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint.

I took English and French. In;It was a requirement in my high school in Italy. I took English and French. In later studies of engineering at a university in the USA, I had the 'audacity' for my electives to take modern English literature courses:)!

2233;21401;rim;1;2;to get high high. make money. money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'rim' is to blame the medical and pharmaceutical industry for the increase in heroin use, rather than marijuana.;The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana;The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana. It is irresponsible to even suggest that. The increase in use was caused by the prescription drug oxycodone. If took the dirty drug heroin and made it into a clean pill. The perfect storm for a young population already in love with pills. Oxycodone on the black market was going for 20 to 60 dollars depending on strength. This lead the cash strapped youth to seek out methods such as smoking it to make it go further. Eventually they figure out smoking oxycodone and smoking heroin are identical and heroin is a lot cheaper. From there they may go on to shooting it up assuming they survive the smoking stage. I guess the fact that the MDs and pharmaceutical industry is to blame might be hard for another doctor to accept so just blame marijuana it always worked in the past.
2234;17646;god;1;2;to not get hurt be upset peaceful avoid conflict;the intention of the tweet towards 'god' is to criticize the use of terrorism or bullying to convince people about god.;To convince about God, please don't use terrorism or bullying... use love, reasoning;Well, that guy just burned a bunch of paper... Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims? Those who punished him are just getting upset for nothing. Can the burning of a Bible or a Koran means war? this is stupid.

2235;344;jerusalem;1;0;to be in control a leader charge power;the intention of the tweet towards 'jerusalem' is to express concern about the potential negative consequences of moving the us embassy to jerusalem, which may be driven by trump's addiction to chaos and attention.;moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would;I believe that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would satisfy one of Mr. Trump's prime addictions. Namely, an addiction to chaos--and attention. Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out. And while Mr. Trump might call doing that being anti establishment. I would call it partly or wholly feeding an addiction.
2236;5035;women;1;1;to be helpful responsible help them;the intention of the tweet towards women is to encourage and support them in having children later in life, while also setting boundaries for babysitting.;My daughter and my daughter-in-law both had their first child at the age of 42;Well, I can only offer this: My daughter and my daughter-in-law both had their first child at the age of 42 and they are two of the most delightful children you could imagine. I helped a bit financially, but their careers are fine.. I did have to make a rule that my wife and I absolutely would not baby sit more than seven days a week. Good luck!

She was willing to enhance the image of dictators and torturers in exchange for contributions to her order. None of that money was spent on mitigating the suffering of those who came to her. I cannot fathom how anybody could consider her to be saintly. Surely even a cynical Church could find somebody more worthy of sainthood. This canonization tells me that the Church has learned nothing from its time mired in scandal, and is still willing to try smoke and mirrors.
2238;2802;public workers;1;1;to get rid of someone be a good person him in control;the intention of the tweet towards public workers is to criticize the firing of a worker for burning a country's flag as a form of political correctness and fear of extremism.;Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. plo;"I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol"", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: ""please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone."""

The government may not interfere with freedom of expression. No need to talk about hate speech or other governments or cultures here - we have a culture that offends others because we do not allow any one group to be beyond criticism or protest. An ideal that we do not always live up to, but one which we never cease to strive towards. Free speech is either free or not.
2240;14573;air congestion;1;0;to be able fly travel save money on fuel money.;the intention of the tweet is to address air congestion in san francisco-los angeles airspace.;Without relieving SF-LA air traffic with high speed rail, our airspace will not;With regard to the assertion that larger airplanes carrying more people will accommodate higher passenger volumes as opposed to more flights (and runways) for conventional aircraft (737s, etc.), not so. An Airbus 380 or Boeing 787 cannot be economically operated between San Francisco and LA at prices and costs competitive with smaller passenger planes. Hence, without relieving SF-LA air traffic with high speed rail, our airspace will not be able to handle the traffic. Already a quarter of intra-state flights are late due to air congestion.
2241;9733;the world;1;1;to know the truth understand situation facts be safe;the intention of the tweet is to correct a common misconception that the murder rate is high due to media coverage, and to provide data showing that the murder rate is actually lower than it has ever been in western europe and even among hunter-gatherers.;Obama is absolutely right;Obama is absolutely right. But it's not just death in war - homicide is way down. People think that the murder rate is high because the news tells us about horrible murders. It is a fact that the homicide rate is lower than it has ever been: you were far more likely to die by murder in every other era. We have the data for Western Europe going back about 1000 years, and the murder rate is lower than its ever been. Even hunter gatherers, whom we like to glorify as living peaceful, natural lives, had higher murder rates than we do.

BUT, the other half of the crisis lies with the deregulation (conservatives) crowd. ""See no corporate evil, hear no corporate evil, speak of no corporate evil.""

Why can't the Israelis and Palestinians each celebrate and share their heritage in Jerusalem? Let every nation place its embassy there as an offering of peace and solidarity.
2245;224;food shortages;1;1;to make money get rich be wealthy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'food shortages' is to highlight the potential negative impact of decreased farm subsidies on food production and exports, which could lead to food shortages and increase in prices.;Potential food shortages is a national security issue;Very one sided discussion: 1. All subsidies go to rich people because there purpose is to draw investment capital into those parts of the market. They have to go to people who have captial. 2. Decreases in farm subsidies will decrease farm production and increase food prices for everyone. 3. Increased farm prices will decrease exports and causing further decreases in production and increase in prices 4. Potential food shortages is a national security issue.

I've heard it all now. And as long as Israel defends nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage', Iran can also defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. So leave Iran alone as long as you allow Israel and any other country to defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. If the US and Israel want Iranian nuclear transparency, then Israel better be just as transparent.
2247;11786;job matches for law;1;0;to be a lawyer get job prepared;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that law schools should reduce the number of law students to match the number of job openings in order to ensure that students are adequately prepared to pass the bar examination.;The law schools have to reduce the number of law students to match the number of job openings;>>It is imperative, however, that law schools not overreact to the bar exam decline by limiting access to legal education. Actually, what is imperative is that law schools not continue to admit people that are not prepared to pass the bar examination. The law schools have to reduce the number of law students to match the number of job openings. The only problem we have is that the law schools are a bit in decline and need to adjust the numbers and live with lower budges.
2248;16575;wellness programs;1;1;have fun get fit better healthy;the intention of the tweet towards wellness programs is to criticize and dismiss them as inadequate compared to competitive sports.;I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous;As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink.
2249;17145;public preschool;1;0;to be a good parent prepared for school citizen help children grow up learn;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for lowering the kindergarten age in the us to provide children with more opportunities for group learning and socialization before starting school.;All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week;There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course). Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better.

I'm wondering what planet Dr. Hart is from. No, the vast majority of cats are not trainable in any way. And so what? If you worship your slipcovers, get a goldfish, and then reconsider what is important in life. If you're worried about your autistic child getting scratched -- and how many people does this apply to?? -- get a nice yellow lab. Then have a glass of wine. But do not mutilate an animal and leave it defenseless in order to allay your neurotic concerns.

I understand Mr. Johnson's points about the university's financial bind, but if state universities will not serve those they are meant to serve, what's the point?

The standard should be raised so that people who are not fit to be lawyers don't waste their time on a profession that will not be good for them or their clients.

DO NOTHING.
2254;9595;refugees;1;1;to make a point. point political be good person;the intention of the tweet towards target'refugees' is to criticize the metaphor used in the article and to point out the hypocrisy of ignoring the radicalized eu citizens while focusing on the refugees as the chief terrorist threat.;pretending that the flood of refugees is the chief terrorist threat while ignoring the tens;I would quibble with the metaphor, but nothing else in this article. I would say that pretending that the flood of refugees is the chief terrorist threat while ignoring the tens of thousands radicalized EU citizens is more like raising the height of the dyke while IGNORING the leaks...how cynical is it to seize on the fact that one of the dozens who planned and carried out the Paris atrocities was hidden in the refugee flow?
2255;8002;veganism;1;0;to be healthy healthier eat get;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the validity of veganism as a healthy lifestyle choice based on the author's personal experience and understanding of human biology.;humans are omnivores by design;Go, Nina! After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt that many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. I didn't believe it until my own health suffered half way through my first year in naturopathic medical school, but there's no room for doubt now.
2256;13641;tip;1;1;to make money. be successful money happy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tip' is to express appreciation for the experience of being served well and the pleasure of tipping graciously.;Right in that tipping creates the environment we enjoy when we go out;Actually Len is both right and wrong. Right in that tipping creates the environment we enjoy when we go out, but wrong in why it does. The people who seek and do well at jobs paid mainly via tips live in that world and it is a world they are competent and appreciated in. To so drastically change that world by eliminating the immediacy of the action and the reward would appeal to a completely different type of person. I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found pleasure in it. But I respect those that do and enjoy both the experience of being served well and the pleasure of tipping graciously.

What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years.

The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate.

After all, who expects Civil Procedure (typically a required first year course) to be on the bar exam? If you graduate from law school, you're golden. While we are at it, why are contracts, court opinions, and legal documents and procedures so difficult and complicated? We should really simplify all things legal. In fact, why do you need to be an attorney to represent others in a court of law or with important documents? Anybody should be able to do it and get paid handsomely as well. Next, we should examine why medical schools, internships and residencies so selective. Also, why are CPA certifications so difficult and time-consuming?

What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy. Keeping abreast of literature and new technologies that will meet the needs of the wide range of learning styles and abilities within one school is a yeoman's job. To expect the classroom teacher to be that expert without support is once again expecting too much from teachers, leading to many leaving the profession. A school librarian, if the right one is hired, can be the school leader in information resource management and use."

2262;1923;refugees;1;0;to be helpful inclusive help people;the intention of the tweet towards target'refugees' is to argue that they are a problem for europe and should not be allowed in.;allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe;Should Europe shun Muslim refugees? Yes, but not only because of what happened in Paris! As much as these refugees are in a really bad situation - people seem to forget that there is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. For different reasons, these immigrants have not integrated into society, refuse to obey local laws and as a group are very hateful and intolerant towards others. You can either call me a racist or a realist - the facts are very hard to ignore. Anyone who thinks that these refugees will be different from those Muslims already in Europe is dreaming - allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe. It is fine to want to help the refugees - how about the Arab countries in the region? I haven't actually seen any Arab countries offering help - or is that heresy?

The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses."

The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps."

And this idiocy is compounded by the paucity of early science education. Children should be taught the history of preventing disease from a very early age. The history vaccination, beginning with Jenner and smallpox vaccination, is a good place to begin. Lessons about are herd immunity necessary too. Just one person being vaccinated isn't enough. Unfortunately, I first learned about this as a very young child when I was hospitalized with polio right before the Salk vaccine began to be used. You want that for your child?

And the infant and mother mortality figures are still among the worst in industrialized nations for U.S. hospital births. There is no queestion that prenatal care from a midwife is superior to that of any obstetrician and that alone makes for a safer experience for mother and child.

My dad owned a 15 unit apartment building and that was considered to be worth $200,000 on my FAFSA. The run-down building had a leaky roof and lost money, and was torn down a few years later at a total loss. My parents total income was $11,000 at the time, and they were expected to contribute $4,500 per year (they said no). Hence, I went to a state school. I think income is better!

With the advent of access to everything in every- ones face all of the time one begins to complete the question asked a celebrity or politician and actually believes that they have a grasp of most abstract concepts, when what they really own is a brief exposure to everyday pop consciousness. This consciousness in invariably the same one exasperated by one or two original sources usually the first to get there on an opinion or worse a twitted diluted version of the original idea layered with sloppy delusion. I suggest that everyday individuals fancy themselves experts on many subjects. Yes they are exposed to much more but do not really sweat the details of an individual program except for their own work and that works knowledge. Are they smarter? Not really because doing is what counts and we have become a society of voyeurs. Individuals fearlessly opionated on varied subjects. True abstract thought is looked at like an alien and difficult to ascertain that is why people are amazed at new art it suggests and usually reflects our present time viewed through fresh eyes.

I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be."

This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!!

This royal marriage may well last (she's definitely;'Normal' ? This royal marriage may well last (she's definitely got staying power), but how 'normal' the British royal family will truly become is anybody's guess. Prince William, for all his good qualities, didn't mix with a lot of 'normal', (i.e. unrich, unposh) people at Eton. He went to St. Andrews, noted for its posh student body, but didn't last a year in university residence there. He was living on a landowner's private estate (with Kate) within six months of starting at St. Andrews. It's taken him eight years to propose to a millionaire's daughter. How much exposure has he had to life in a less hierarchical society than the British armed forces ? Not a promising start, for anyone expected to move to a more Scandinavian-style monarchy.
2278;4748;a palestinian state;1;1;to be a leader make difference recognized respected;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that recognition by other countries would make it easier for palestine to fulfill the basic elements of statehood and prevent attacks by its citizens on israel or any other country.;Israel would be more likely to negotiate with Palestine if it was recognized by other governments;Israel would be more likely to negotiate with Palestine if it was recognized by other governments. These other governments would expect any Palestinian government to prevent attacks by its citizens on Israel or any other country. Recognition by other countries would make it easier for Palestine to fulfill the basic elements of statehood. It would rally Palestinians behind a policy that was achieving some change. Of course, they have to rally behind the policy to the extent that they will help the police track and stop extremists, even if the extremists are relatives. But in the West Bank this has been pretty much achieved. If Israel could abandon some of its settlements and prevent any terrorism by extremists who opposed this abandonment, and Palestine could prevent terrorism by extremists who opposed the recognition of Israel, we would have something workable.

Think how well we could be living now if we hadn't deforested our lands, polluted our waters, degraded our soils and overtaxed our aquifers and rivers. Would the middle east seem so intractable a problem if there was still plenty of water and arable land available; if the population of the region was just a fraction of what it is today? Think of the vast advances civilization made in the first and second millenniums with less than a billion people living on this planet. If birth control had been practiced earlier in our history would we be any less advanced a civilization?"

2281;17050;early education;1;1;to be a good parent prepared for school citizen help children grow up learn;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for early education and suggest lowering the kindergarten age in the us.;The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better;There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course). Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better.
2282;21543;republican;1;2;to be in charge control help the students helpful;the intention of the tweet is to criticize school administrators' lack of understanding and appreciation for the role of librarians and the importance of library resources, especially in the context of new technology and research methods.;Too many school administrators, and subject teachers too, think of the library as the baby sitting department;The reason school administrators are reviewing library budgets in light of new technology is because they themselves are mostly confused about new technology-and all too few of them have ever had much insight into what librarians do in schools. Too many school administrators, and subject teachers too, think of the library as the baby sitting department. Meanwhile, the librarians-who are usually the only professionals in the school with notable training in research methods-go along quietly, educating students about how to tell a source from a delusion. The web has made that need more acute, not less. Good quality school administrators know that, but they are few and far between.

We are seeing cases of measles, mumps, etc. increase, and this cannot be all the fault of those who have lived with and been in contact daily in this country since birth with their peers who have been vaccinated. I'm old, and when in 1st grade, I contacted German measles. NOT from someone in my class and, in fact, no one seemed to know where I contacted it. I then proceeded to infect almost all my entire class apparently. My point in telling this story is that we cannot know exactly where a child gets his contact, and therefore IMO opinion, vaccinations should be mandatory for every child entering schools from pre-K up. Until everyone - from the child who comes with their parents to America to the kiddo next door, we have to be consistent.

Why are we taxpayers paying millions of dollars for TFA and, here in NYC, NYC Teaching Fellows, et al while other grad students like myself are struggling to get through paying our own way and facing more and more miserable job prospects?? Why should I (and laid off teachers) have to compete with govt-sponsored, less-qualified drones who are hand-picked for their willingness to follow blindly if not for the fact that they water down the labor force in a period when the government is trying to undercut and underfund US education?

Trust me, this is discouraging dual citizenship and encouraging people to take on another and drop their US citizenship. Many of you will say that this is the cost of membership!! It just happens that after living in several other countries, many of us realize that the USA is not a club we want to be part of. So yes, we give up our citizenship. Good riddance you might say? Fine, but who do you think is loosing the most, the skilled expat workers and professionals who make a conscious decision to abandon their citizenship and are in demand around the word or the US? As an aside, the USA is only one of two countries in the world to double tax its non-resident citizens... the other is Eretrya, a small country in the horn of Africa ruled by one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world.

Like extending the copyright term to life of the author plus 80 years, does that fulfill the constitutional rationale to ""promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts?""

2289;570;fake news;1;1;to be informed learn something new informed. about;the intention of the tweet towards target 'fake news' is to express concern about the limited range of information that passive consumers of news on facebook are exposed to, which can lead to being fed biased and incomplete information.;Being fed a restricted news stream is a path toward puppetry;Here is what scares me most about Facebook as a primary source of news. As a traditional consumer of news, I actively seek out information. That is, I search news sites, (this one primarily and a few others to a lesser degree) to find out what is happening in the world. In doing so, I learn about things that I most likely would never discover on my own because I didn't know they existed. Much of the under 40 crowd is oblivious to my news world. They only know of news that hits their Facebook page. The news comes to them. They don't seek out the news. They are passive consumers while I am active. In doing so, the range of information they are exposed to is highly limited. This is dangerous for an open society. Being fed bits and pieces of news based upon browsing history, buying habits, or selection fields greatly restricts what goes into ones head. Reading a newspaper is an act of discovery. Being fed a restricted news stream is a path toward puppetry.

Knowing Ann Romney's background, I heard exactly what I would have expected: ' I'm Ann Romney and I chose a good provider.' I simplify, obviously, but hearing spouses talk does tell us things we should know about the men asking for our votes. My husband both reflects me and reflects on me.

Milner used this as an opportunity;I completely agree with the comments posted by Mike Melcher. Milner used this as an opportunity to push his upcoming book. Yes equality is a problem and has been a problem throughout human existence. He avoided the issue. All kids need to do homework. It is a simple way to see if your child is learning, if they sit down in front of an assignment and have no idea what to do, you as a parent need to be aware of that and help them learn. It's part of the job description, at least in my book. And if I can teach my kid more than someone else, well that's life. Someone will always have more and someone will always have less. I still need to do the best I can.

Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects.

I see obscene sums of money thrown at efforts to overthrow ancient public access rights. Every rich out of towner shows up, buys property that has allowed public access of one kind or another for centuries, and then does their damnedest to change the rules. Hey pal, you're a smart guy, you knew what you were buying! On the other hand, I think members of the public should respect the adjacent property owners by keeping litter, noise and nuisance to a minimum. The only thing that I know that can close a beach to access here is piping plovers hatching.

For jobs requiring quiet and deep immersion in thought, an open plan can be the kiss of death. Almost thirty years ago temporary removal of cubicle walls in my IT department created chaos. It sometimes takes quite a bit of time to mentally drill down to the core of a problem. The constant distractions, visual and aural, of a badly designed open plan can, in a moment, put you right back in square one. Repeat until end of day, every day, and see how productive you are.

Every term there'd be some new student in my class who'd just been expelled from a parochial school. Of course, the public school has to take those kids. That taught me as a child why private schools look like they have such a great success rate. They can kick out their lowest performers, while the public schools cannot. Looks like the same with charters, too.

FDR stands before Congress, asking for a declaration of war against Japan. The ships in Pearl Harbor still spewing smoke. But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns.

Still, I always asked my parents to proofread my work before turning it in. Those evenings in which my parents edited at my side turned out to improve my writing so much more than my teachers ever could. That one-on-one, painstakingly specific instruction taught me that active voice is preferable to passive and that there is a difference between formal, academic essays and casual, creative writing. Just because my parents helped me craft an essay didn't mean I didn't learn to become a better writer from that experience, and it certainly didn't make me dependent on them throughout my life. My younger sister, on the other hand, resisted their help, preferring to do her work alone. She became an exceptional writer and went to a great school. In the end, each kid has different needs. I don't think you can make a blanket statement saying ""all parents should do this"" or ""all homework help (or homework, for that matter) is counterproductive."""

It seems since the financial collapse of 2008, banks are afraid to loan money.

I had my two children in my mid-thirties; quite the norm for professional women.

My husband's and my parents are older than most, more fragile, grappling with health issues, dementia, financial, housing, and end-of-life difficulties. They need every bit as much attention as our teenagers do. As do our careers, at peak. So which of these competing interests gets short- changed? There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish fervently I'd had my kids in my twenties. They'd be grown by now, and I could take at least one thing off my plate. I am tired. I'd love to be able to kick back and enjoy grand kids and nothing else."

The quest for a second Palestinian state is a ploy to destroy Israel - which, strangely enough. most Palestinians freely admit (see Hamas). The ultra sophisticated Europeans who destroyed their Jews, either directly or by looking away - as, infamously, did the New York Times - are obsessing over Jews yet again. An equitable solution for peaceful coexistence can be found for all the people of the area - but not while Arabs still dream (the cold peace with Egypt and Jordan notwithstanding) - with the moral support of the hypocritical Europeans of destroying Israel, wholesale or piecemeal.

Plus, I get bored sitting in front of a screen. Then again, I'm not from the generation who willingly sits for hours playing video games. Give me a human teacher anytime!

I've noted that children born to upper-middle and high income parents suffer a diminished capacity to learn just as low-income children, owing to disinterested or ineffectual parenting. There will always be exceptions to the norm--the largely self-taught Abraham Lincoln, for instance. For the most part, however, it seems to make more sense to devote preventative measures whenever possible in order to improve the lives of our citizenry, thereby enriching the nation as well.

I have often commented that beach front property would be wasted on me, and those who most want it and are willing to pay for it should have it. I do, however, believe that private ownership should be limited to the spaces above and adjoining the beaches. Public access to the beach seems to be a no-brainer. I believe we should also make these private owners of beach adjacent property responsible for rebuilding their own homes when the next storm or tsunami comes their way. Beach cottages used to be ramshackle affairs, built on sticks, with second hand wicker furniture. Now the hoipolloi builds mega million dollar mansions, filled with great furniture and art on the beach. Surprise surprise, your house got washed a way again. The Federal Government should stop encouraging and supplementing people who build irresponsible sand castles on foundations of sand.

I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that.
2316;17921;electric rates;1;0;to save money energy make be efficient;criticizes high electric rates in nh.;NH has the highest electric rates in the country;I have two serious issues with plug-in cars, local and national. Locally, NH has the highest electric rates in the country (thanks, Seabrook). Nationally, plugging in is a huge waste of energy. To get a gallon of gas worth of electricity out of a wall socket, we need to put at least three gallons into the generator. Every time energy changes state, there is a loss: fuel to heat, heat to steam, steam to mechanical energy, mechanical to electrical, and in the car, electrical to battery, battery to mechanical, mechanical to tires, tires to motion. Add that to transmission losses, and you end up with a lot of waste instead of savings. Plug-in cars will add to the problem, not solve it.
2317;11683;college athletics;1;0;to be a leader make money. money fair;criticize the negative impact of college sports on student life and academics.;College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog;College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate.

See prayer as the personality's half of the dialogue: the kind of prayer when we, sensing a decision that needs to be made, sort the possibilities and make the decision. Meaning it, building that habit. Then the prayer after the decision is made, is, how does my real self, the soul, see this situation? I had a teacher who taught me to dream this way, and I have, for years. And taught it, mostly to meditators. It is transformative. And yes, it leads to lucid dreams, which themselves are rich and helpful and further, make the soul real. And, I want to say of course, lead to lucid living, with a healthy flow of timely decisions, and the solace of a real dialogue with something timeless and universal but wholly inner.

With what training will they be able to accomplish this task? As a college professor, I am routinely appalled at the writing ability and general innumeracy of my otherwise bright students. Public education needs stronger support; a tax break for home schooling solves nothing. How can we train twenty parents to do a better job than one professional?"

But perhaps the deciding factor is;Pot may historically be correlated with increased illegal drug use. But perhaps the deciding factor isn't the marajuana, but the illegal activity: once you've done one thing illegal, it's easy to do more. By legalizing, it is no longer a gateway to more illegal activity.

We are primates, and our closest genetic relatives (chimps) are omnivores. What's more revelant is that our digestive systems are still we equipped for eating raw animal protein such as sushi, clams and oysters on the half-shell, and steak tartare. Don't try eating raw potatoes, beets, or beans though, they're all indigestible to us. Although cutting back on animal-based foods is certainly healthful, a purely vegan diet offers many challenges to be complete.

But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than ""to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. "" There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi."

2327;4712;a gateway drug;1;1;to be a leader help others people;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the reactive approach to marijuana regulation and advocate for prioritizing education on the dangers of all drugs, including alcohol.;The fact that people do not recognize alcohol as a far more dangerous drug than marijuana is more;Yes. Thank you. Except: > And for those who develop a substance dependency, marijuana regulation will generate revenue to support drug treatment for those who need and want it. That's the reactive approach. Resources do need to go to treatment. but also to prior education. The fact that people do not recognize alcohol as a far more dangerous drug than marijuana is more proof than we'd ever need that we are making rules without having even a basic understanding of the science or sociology of addiction.

The result was a disaster for the tourist industry. Local citizens were permitted to gamble. Many became hooked on gambling, only to see their lives destroyed. Home values tanked. Divorces went up, along with the occasional suicide. The last thing a local economy needs is one of these outfits. Definitely a very bad idea. They suck the money out of the local economy...to say nothing of the bad social elements they attract. Yikes!
2330;1046;grade colleges;1;0;to make sure everyone is on the same page students get a good education have level doing their best;the intention of the tweet is to suggest a more holistic approach to evaluating colleges, focusing on multiple indexes of student achievement rather than ranking.;Ranking, per se, is unnecessary, and it would force colleges and induce students to focus on;Ranking, per se, is unnecessary, and it would force colleges and induce students to focus on a single score rather than education. But more information is needed about the value of the educational experience each college provides. The government would do well to develop indexes of various kinds of student achievement. Perhaps five or ten indexes, uniformly scaled 0 to 10 or 0 100, would each measure an important aspect of a college's student body's performance. It would not be necessary to rank-order colleges, because each of the 5 or 10 scores would use the same standardized scale.
2331;7364;drug;1;1;to get high high. make money. have fun;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drug' is to express the devastating effects of drug addiction on individuals and their families.;My son started using drugs when he was in his teens;I have personal experience in this matter. My son started using drugs when he was in his teens. He got into trouble with the law and served time in prison. When he started to get his life back together he found himself unable to find a job because of his record. This had a devastating effect on his life. He worked in the underground economy which is a sure ticket to trouble. He got off drugs, married and had a son. But he relapsed and lost what little he had gained. Flash forward to the present: last September he was found dead in his apartment of an overdoes of heroin and fentanyl. He had been plagued by depression and self-medicated. Although he had hundred's of friends, and was considered a great person, he couldn't fight the demons alone. He is not blameless but the laws of our land that punished without any hope of rehabilitation certain conspired to keep him down.

In the last few years, i have actually had office personnel who literally could not file- did not seem to understand the alphabet. This was unheard of twenty years ago- at least with the alleged degree of education some of these people have. During this recession, which to me does not seem to be over, i have been astounded at the many people hired who do not understand that if i want them to do a certain job, they had better perform it or they won't have a job! They are actually shocked when fired, even when given several verbal and written warnings. And of course i see typos every day in the print media, and not just low quality media either, although i suppose it is due to lack of editors or an over-reliance on spell-checker. i am getting more forgetful because of age but i still seem to have a better grasp of general things then the kids half my age. Maybe their brains are disturbed by all the things they are exposed to at much too young an age- like television or texting.
2333;21842;farm subsidy;1;2;to be a leader in charge control power;the intention of this tweet is to express criticism and concern about the long-term impact of 1960s counterculture on current american society, education, and values, blaming it for perceived moral decline and the success of socialist ideas.;"The ""hippies"" are now running our education systems and our entertainment business";"We are reaping the long term rewards of the 60's hippie overthrow of our culture and values system. The ""hippies"" are now running our education systems and our entertainment business.

We can blame only ourselves. The result of the Cold War was that socialists realised that no one could beat America with military force, but our education system was ripe for plucking. With political correctness and debasement of American pride and self worth, they won. We have ""fallen down and can't get up""."

It's worth pointing out that attacking people trying to assist victims in a second strike is a violation of the First Geneva Convention, which the United States has signed. This rule was put in place specifically to prevent the kind of situation where an attack has occurred, medics try to rescue the wounded, and somebody just starts killing medics. That means that anyone ordering those sorts of strikes (which are definitely happening) is a war criminal."

The corruption is easy to see, and to say it's relatively rare is to be willfully blind. The methods of corruption that are perfectly legal and extremely common include but are not limited to: - Super PACs - The straight-up $5000 campaign donation - An offer of a cushy job at a private company when the politician or regulator leaves office - Donor ""bundling"" - Insider trading on congressional activity (i.e. a committee is secretly considering a bill that affects an industry, and the members of that committee make stock trades in that industry benefiting from that knowledge) There are lots of ways that those that can pay get what they want from public officials that don't involve saying ""Here's $500 if you give my company the contract."""

Librarians teach among other things, finding and evaluating information. This skill is of tantamount importance. It is needed throughout life. It's a skill that is used for everything from deciding what movie to see to deciding where to buy your next home. Classroom teachers have less and less time to teach anything that is not evaluated on a standardized test. This is what No Child Left Behind has wrought. Lawmakers and administrators are very short-sighted if they think that eliminating school librarians will have little impact on their students. As Samuel Johnson stated ""Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it."" Without librarians, who will teach students how to find it?"
2338;7237;hydrocarbon;1;1;to save the planet environment earth world;the intention of the tweet towards 'hydrocarbon' is to suggest that it is not a long-term solution and that alternative technologies such as solar, wind, tidal, and hydro should be left in place for future generations to use for organic chemistry.;Free energy collection technologies (solar, wind, tidal, hydro) are;Finding all the earth's hydrocarbons and burning them as fast as possible is not long range planning.

Seems a dumb trade from the restaurateur's point of view. The few extra bucks he picks up from one-time diners is going to be drowned by all the money he loses from regular patrons, who can't get the convenience and service they want. They'll go elsewhere, and he'll never see those one-time trend-surfers ever again. Buh-bye, Empellon. As for myself, I think all this is deeply silly. If I can't get a table at a restaurant at a decent time without having to wait on line, I go somewhere else. Lots of people can cook. It's just not that rare a skill, especially in a city like New York.

Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others. Nationalism, and the intense 'marriage-like' sense of citizenship that it engenders, is a double-edged sword: valuable in moderation, dangerous when exaggerated, as Mr. Krikorian does.

I refer to the small to medium size family farm. Smaller farms can detail their crops and rotations to better conserve soil and water. They support a traditional farmer life style. Small farms support small towns, local banks, grocery stores, schools, equipment dealers and a wide farmer's work ethic. Larger farms destroy all of this. If we support farms in order to help America, let's support small farms that actually help it.

As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary."
2350;21848;antidepressant;1;2;to make money. get a raise be generous. generous money;the intention of this tweet is to advocate for the abolition of tipping in the restaurant industry, arguing that it exploits workers, undermines wages, and lacks transparency, while suggesting that ending tipping would improve service, work experience, and dining experience.;I'm not sure if I'm depressed or just tired;It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.

Arrest should be devoted to people who need social resource. That may mean help, control, or both. It changes people for the better and build trust. People are happier when they know their enforcement of the law is building bridges in communities that may need help. Everyone deserves objective feedback, no one deserves to be abused. Broken windows should be a policy of fixing little things and not draconian punishment for little failures. Cleaning up graffiti, getting kids off the street, and reducing sensational adult advertisement in family communities; those are broken windows. Change can be accomplished mostly by better alternatives and more second chances (learning to do better)."
2352;1185;technology;1;1;to save the planet be a leader environment help;the intention of the tweet towards target 'technology' is to highlight the potential positive impact of exponential technological advancements on the planet, which can outweigh the negative effects of linear population growth.;The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact;Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth.

When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.

Putting ""environmental safeguards"" in place and preventing disasters are not the same thing.

Still, engineered systems fail and all too recently we've had well-head blowouts (Deep Water Horizon), refinery explosions and fires, and oil transport disasters ranging from pipeline ruptures to tank train derailments to the Exxon Valdez. Imagine a perfect storm situation off Virginia Beach where a well head blowout coincided with a Hurricane Sandy. Crude oil from the Chesapeake to Iceland and a potentially mortal blow to already fragile shore communities and fisheries along the way. The only way to be 100% sure that the East Coast won't suffer catastrophic damage from oil production is to outlaw the outlandishly risky exploitation of hydrocarbons in our salty ocean waters."

Make education like toll roads--only paid for by the users.

Any sch;"HAHA! I am soon to be the mother of two smart young women. They're too young now to be eligible for Miss America. But I can assure you, I will NOT, as you say, encourage them to ""consider competing in the Miss American pageant."" NO WAY. I will vociferously DIScourage them from doing so. Any ""scholarship"" competition that asks my daughter to put on a swimsuit without asking them to actually swim; or put on a dress that she has not designed and sewn herself is NOT a competition we want to be involved with. Any job or school that asks her to submit a photograph of herself for the purposes of judging her attractiveness: also, no. It's a farce, Ms. Friedman. You've been sold a false bag of goods. You don't have to be slender and gorgeous to be a scientist, musician, policy advocate, or any other such important job. Not even to be a TV pundit. Well, if you're a man, anyway. Plenty of gnarly looking men have front and center jobs in front of the camera. Hm."
2358;9644;motherhood;1;1;to have a family be parent child father children;the intention of the tweet towards motherhood is regret for not having more children, specifically a daughter.;My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31;My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children.

2360;12331;post election in israel;1;0;to be in power charge the leader control;the tweet accuses the us and israel of orchestrating a coup in the post-election standoff in israel, which ultimately failed and exposed the leaders involved as quislings.;The post election standoff was cemented in place by a US/Israeli sponsored coup;The post election standoff was cemented in place by a US/Israeli sponsored coup prepared by Fatah's leader-in-prospect Dahlan. He so bungled that he left himself out of serious contention for leadership of Fatah. That was his power play to replace Abbas as the useful tool of Israel, and he both failed and exposed himself for the Quisling that he is. Still, the Palestinians never recovered from the coup attempt pushed by the US and Israel. The reaction to this unity attempt highlights the continuing use by them of the division of the Palestinians, the gift of the Quisling that keeps on giving.
2361;16194;employment;1;1;to be successful productive make money work hard;the intention of the tweet is to express dissatisfaction with the current employment situation and desire for respect and efficiency.;I can do the best work of my career there;"""Because I can do the best work of my career there."" I think that constitutes fun, or at least satisfaction. Any company that PREVENTS employees from working productively, despite increasing demands upon said productivity - misery all around. I don't care about fancy gyms, I want respect and efficiency. And yes, not to drop dead at age 50 from a heart attack."
2362;7720;lobby;1;1;to be a good person citizen save the environment safe;the intention of the tweet towards target 'lobby' is to criticize the lack of transparency and accountability in the publishing process of the atlantic magazine.;Why was this lobbyist published without at least asking them we they won't also lobby for;Why was this lobbyist published without at least asking them we they won't also lobby for true best practices. We learned in the gulf what can go wrong. Well the Atlantic is stormier. So what new technology exists to quickly contain a spill? In the late 1950s there was an oil tanker incident in the Atlantic. All I remember about it is my mother bringing nail polish remover to the beach to clean off the tar balls from our legs.
2363;17690;arab leaders;1;0;to be a good person honest. honest independent;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the credibility of america as an honest broker and its support for corrupt arab leaders such as mubarak and abdullah of saudi arabia.;corrupt Arab despots and dictaters;America absolutely cannot and has loost all credibility as an honest broker a long time ago - except with corrupt Arab despots and dictaters such as was the case with Mubarak and now abdullawhom of saudi arabia whom it nurtures and protects.
2364;15496;un general assembly;1;1;to be a good person citizen learn about the people know truth;the intention of this tweet is to express frustration and criticize the perceived lack of attention to palestinian rights during un general assembly discussions.;those talks never seem to include the rights of the Palestinian person!;We hear pompous talks every year at the UN General Assembly about the inalienable rights of the citizens of our planet, except that those talks never seem to include the rights of the Palestinian person! Palestinians must be from some other planet, it seems! We have to check the make-up of their DNA!
2365;8475;flat earth;1;0;to be a scientist heard. heard fair;the intention of the tweet is to criticize flat-earthers and their ilk for being given equal time in scientific debates.;flat-earthers and their ilk with flaky, religious-based conclusions should;The biggest problem right now is the media giving equal time in every serious debate to quacks and loonies and like Sharon Howell. Flat-earthers and their ilk with flaky, religious-based conclusions should not be given air time in any discussion of scientific facts.
2366;13812;how things/classes are being dumbed down and people are becoming intellectually lazy;1;0;to learn something new make a point be understood;the intention of the tweet is to express dissatisfaction with the quality of education and art classes, and to criticize the intellectual laziness of people.;The dumbed-down science and mathematics. The teachers' sloppy grammar and spelling;There are many things that I find objectionable. Intellectual sloth, for one. The dumbed-down science and mathematics. The teachers' sloppy grammar and spelling. The language study that never gets beyond tourist phrases and insincere smalltalk. The pathetically underequipped half-efforts that pass for art classes. Why fear fringe lunatics? Are not the rigorists among us strong enough to make requests of our own?
2367;7695;childhood memories of school librarians;1;1;to show appreciation be respectful respected learn;the intention of the tweet is to express gratitude towards childhood school librarians, mrs archer and mrs devoll, who had a significant impact on the author's life.;Mrs Archer and Mrs DeVoll, who ran the public library branch in my neighborhood,;I was a library aide in elementary school, for Mrs Archer, who treated both books and people with respect. I still have the dictionary she gave me at the end of sixth grade, when I moved up to junior high school, and another library. Mrs Archer and Mrs DeVoll, who ran the public library branch in my neighborhood, were both a huge part of my life as a child -- I am incredibly grateful to them and to all their colleagues, and am thrilled to have this chance to recognize them here, among their peers.
2368;8369;palestinian state;1;0;to be in charge control a leader the independent;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'palestinian state' is to express approval and support for obama's policy change and to criticize netanyahu's actions.;Obama has made it clear that the U.S. makes its own policy. He's;Obama has made it clear that the U.S. makes its own policy. He's refused to be wagged by the dog. He reversed George W. Bush's policy of supporting permanent annexation of the settlements and returned to the formula that the rest of the world supports: a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. I would say that Netanyahu by his gratuitous insult and ham-fisted meddling in U.S. politics, has lost his influence with the U.S.
2369;17623;the bar;1;1;to be a lawyer get degree job make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'the bar' is to question its appropriateness as a measure of success for art or music schools.;Has anyone ever questioned whether the bar is too low for art or music school?;If law schools were public elementary, middle, or secondary schools, someone would already be talking about closing or selling the ones that don't produce enough graduates who can pass the bar exam. In truth, many start out, but few arrive. Has anyone ever questioned whether the bar is too low for art or music school?
2370;2288;everyone;1;0;to be healthy healthy. not get sick stay;the intention of the tweet is to express the author's negative experience with a vegan diet and their preference for a diet that includes grassfed meats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and water/teas.;I would probably die on a vegan diet;I would probably die on a vegan diet. I don't do well with ANY grains (even white rice leaves me bloated). That means no wheat, no corn, no barley, no quinoa, no oats... Gluten is my enemy. Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas. (On a side note, I had all symptoms of PCOS - then I got surprisingly very pregnant after cleaning up my diet.) Yes, a vegan diet would likely kill me. Probably my baby too.
2371;697;teching;1;1;to be educated knowledgeable help students learn;the intention of the tweet towards 'teaching' is to criticize the decision makers who think they know what is good for students without understanding the realities of teaching.;My advice to politicians, policy makers, and pundits is to spend a few days;It seems that many of the comments in this thread are from educators who are in the classroom, face to face with students every day, as am I. My experience teaching students to use the Internet and do efficient, objective research runs the gamut from those who easily learn techniques for evaluating and validating information to those who can be convinced that President Lincoln was actually a female based on a ridiculous edited photo and a headline on a tabloid from the grocery store! My advice to politicians, policy makers, and pundits is to spend a few days in a school, in Mr. Wurman's case with certified Library Media Specialist, and see what is really going on. The problem with schools today is not the teachers, it is the decision makers who think they know what is good for students because they once went to school.
2372;16498;employing immigrants;1;0;to know the truth be informed facts understand situation;criticize the employment of immigrants.;I am a liberal but I've known people who can no longer fine regular employment in;Does the Center for Immigration Studies actually study or conduct research on anything, immigration or otherwise? I don't think so. So why is this group, which contrary to actual principles of research and study has already drawn its conclusions, invited to give comment on a perfectly legitimate question? I am a liberal but I've known people who can no longer fine regular employment in the construction industry because those jobs now go to immigrants who are paid lower wages and offered no benefits such as workman's comp. Many readers on the right and the left understand the many social benefits of immigration but have a reasonable worry of wages being driven further down in an economy in which the rewards seem to go almost exclusively to the top. Real, thoughtful debate or commentary from credible, nonideologically driven sources would be appreciated by NYTimes readers.
2373;18887;educational funding;1;0;to be a good teacher parent get better education job grade;criticize the effectiveness of public education and argue for alternative education options.;Spending per student continues to increase while student performance has been flat, or by some measures,;Since the creation of the Dept. of Education, billions of dollars have been spent to improve public education. Spending per student continues to increase while student performance has been flat, or by some measures, has decreased. With this record, can anyone justify universal pre-school? Brick and mortar schools are becoming dinosaurs. Charter schools, home-schooling and approaches are being chosen by many families who see public schools as inadequate, and public school teachers as captives of the politics of the teacher's unions. With this trend, can anyone justify expanding public educaiton to include 4 and 5 year olds?
2374;20525;office layout;1;2;to be in control make money. money get ahead;the user expresses frustration with companies moving manufacturing overseas while trying to restrict employees' job mobility, and criticizes their hypocrisy regarding intellectual property rights and corporate secrecy.;Quite laughable when you think China, in particular, has paid little attention to patent rights;How ironic in which for decades now companies have been moving their manufacturing to low wage off shore locations to boost their profits yet they feel it necessary to attempt to legally inhibit an employee from moving on to a a better opportunity with another organization? Quite laughable when you think China, in particular, has paid little attention to patent rights and intellectual property, let alone their ongoing attempted hacking of American corporate secrets, yet, these companies remain there. If a company insisted on me signing such a questionable agreement, it is time to look elsewhere. The hypocrisy here is beyond the pale.
2375;10382;vegetarian;1;1;to be healthy healthy. a vegetarian healthier;the intention of the tweet is to promote the benefits of a vegan diet for physical and mental health, and to encourage others to consider a vegetarian lifestyle.;I am a vegan, and both my children are vegans from the day they were born;"This lady's ignorance is profound. For instance, soy does not contain estrogen. The molecular structure of soy appears similar to estrogen, but it is NOT estrogen and the body doesn't treat it as such. This is a myth, perpetrated by the dairy industry for obvious reasons. I am a vegan, and both my children are vegans from the day they were born. This is anecdotal evidence, but they are both usually tall, strong, healthy. One is getting a Ph.d and the other had a perfect score on the army intelligence test; both are irritating know it alls, definitely playing with full decks.. Because they were raised with compassionate hearts, they are both the kindest and most thoughtful people I know. Both of them have thanked me and their father repeatedly for raising them vegetarians."
2376;21004;gene;1;2;to save money money. make a profit;the intention of the tweet towards 'gene' is to challenge the author's claim that the use of illegal labor is costly for farmers.;I don't see much real data in this. What kind of economist does that?;I don't see much real data in this. What kind of economist does that? Real economists who have really looked at this have discovered that the actual cost at retail of not using illegal labor is very small, under 5%. The actual farm labor costs are swamped by capital costs, storage, transportation and distribution, spoilage and retail markup. In addition, there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions.
2377;3763;birth control;1;1;to be a good parent mother citizen person women educated;encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive.;Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive;Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off.
2378;19585;illegal immigration;1;2;to be cooperative helpful work together help;the intention of this tweet is to promote cooperation between two countries, emphasizing mutual interests and potential benefits, despite existing tensions and an embargo.;Recognize mutual interests;"Both countries have Interests Sections in Washington and Havana. There is no reason whatsoever that programs cannot be initiated right now even with the embargo in place. But both countries have to be willing to work together and avoid the easy out of saying the other side is intransigent. Recognize mutual interests. For example, both countries have an interest in studying hurricanes, coral reefs and generally looking at climate change; a particular threat to south Florida and Cuba. These kinds of programs raise awareness that cooperation is preferable and in mutual interests of each country."
2379;18407;hospital birth;1;1;to be a doctor the best make difference helpful;the user expresses frustration with obstetricians' perceived lack of action to improve hospital birth safety and criticizes their attitudes towards midwives and homebirth advocates.;It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that;"It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that the female ones are much better in this regard) make remarks like ""oh yes, we should be doing a better job"" of making hospital birth safer, with fewer C-sections and better outcomes -- and less trauma -- for mothers and babies, etc. If they really cared about ""doing a better job"" they would have been working towards changing the hospital environment and protocols already, and they're not. Very little has changed for the better and in fact c-section rates continue to rise. (And increasingly obstetricians have *less* training now in techniques such as vaginal breech delivery, forceps delivery, VBAC . . .) I'm really not seeing this urge to do ""a better job"" that they keep talking about. They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real concerns. Also, the attempt by these commentators to equate advocates of homebirth with ""anti-vaxxers"" and ""junk science"" is rather scurrilous. The circumstances and practices involved, and the quality of argument and evidence in each case, are not equivalent."

Killing and maiming across the world and the seven seas, arming Israel to the teeth and disregarding the most basic human rights anywhere in the world, even in the US where people (mostly men) get shot left and right every day.
2381;19784;employee;1;2;to make money be rich get wealthy;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'employee' is not specified.;Wealth is hamburgers, cars, buildings, all the things we need to live;Wealth is not money. Wealth is hamburgers, cars, buildings, all the things we need to live. To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating anything. It is simply taking advantage of the frailties of the human condition to rob people. A caution however... everything has consequences, to build more Casinos is to invite more debt in the terms of social payments to the newly poor who have dumped their life savings into these black holes. The misery caused is also a real effect but our government seems to to be oblivious to misery caused. It seems to work to perfect it.
2382;18199;affirmative actions;1;0;to be inclusive fair help people;the intention of the tweet is to suggest a new approach to affirmative actions that focuses on socioeconomic factors rather than race and gender.;It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of;We should establish a Disenfranchised Index that looks, at many things ( examples include): neighborhood, parents (one or two), parent's own education and their income, family stability and environment, family history around employment, public assitance access to opportunityetc) and help those that score lower as early in life as possible. It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment.
2383;17279;family owned businesses;1;1;to help the poor support a cause environment community be fair;the intention of the tweet is to support family owned businesses.;I will gladly pay the higher price of vegetables if I new it helps a family;Totally agree with this view, but I have not heard any comments pertaining the posture of Big Farming and their supporters. Regardless I will gladly pay the higher price of vegetables if I new it helps a family owned business.
2384;14953;emission;1;0;to get rid of regulation regulations be a good citizen person;the author's intention towards the target 'emission' is to diminish the role of regulation.;I haven't heard any serious call for more regulation of the emissions problem;I haven't heard any serious call for more regulation of the emissions problem, All I hear is a call to make it harder for companies to cheat by improving testing of vehicles. This is not additional regulation. The author in using a massive cheating scandal to diminish the role of regulation is again promoting the small government agenda. This scandal is proof that government regulation and testing is essential. Without it this fraud would never have been detected.
2385;20687;supreme court influencing election;1;2;to be a leader make money. farmer profit;the intention of this tweet is to correct a historical inaccuracy and critique modern agricultural subsidies, advocating for a shift towards a more sustainable agricultural paradigm if subsidies are eliminated.;The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not;"Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--""get big or get out""--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture."
2386;968;women's colleges;1;0;to get a good job education compete with men men. be wife;criticize the limitations and hypocrisy of women's colleges.;Single sex colleges are a remnant of an elite world where female students were trained to;Single sex colleges are a remnant of an elite world where female students were trained to be good wives for rich male students, not to become independent working women (as so many end up being anyway). I attended an exclusive, very expensive women's college yet there were men everywhere anyway (as boyfriends). If women plan on competing in the real working world they might as well get used to competing with men as soon as possible.
2387;14151;elections;1;1;to be a good judge person fair everyone;the intention of the tweet towards target 'elections' is to argue that justice ginsburg should be allowed to give her opinion on the trump-republican party situation without fear of recusal, as the case is unlikely to materialize.;Unless someone is planning to take the Republican Party to Court to prevent them from naming Trump;Justices are asked questions all the time about cases that may come before the Supreme Court. That is where they have to refrain from issuing opinions prior to testimony. Unless someone is planning to take the Republican Party to Court to prevent them from naming Trump as their candidate for president, there is no reason why Justice Ginsburg should not be able to give her opinion. She can always recuse herself should the case actually materialize, but, I doubt very much that 4 members of the court would ever vote to hear whether or not the Emperor really has New Clothes.
2388;19825;delayed child;1;2;to get high high. have fun use drugs;the intention of the tweet is to argue that milk and dairy products are a gateway drug to heroin and should be banned.;i'm not a sexist;"""It should come as no surprise that the vast majority of heroin users have used marijuana (and many other drugs) not only long before they used heroin but while they are using heroin."" It should come as no surprise that the vast majority of heroin users have used milk (and many other dairy products) not only long before they used heroin but while they are using heroin. Therefore, milk and dairy products are a gateway drug to heroin and should be banned."

There are always going to be those who slip through the border -- but we need to catch them in the interior. We should never adopt the current position that if you make it to the US interior and don't get caught you can stay. Our interior enforcement needs to be just as tough as our border enforcement that that should include, nannies, maid, lawncare people, gardners, students etc.
2390;1299;medical websites;1;1;to understand the results know be informed learn more;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to express dissatisfaction with the lack of time and communication from the author's doctor, leading them to rely on medical websites for information.;This is the reason that I use Dr. Google... not enough time from my doctor;I would love to be able to use my doctor as a reference, but unfortunately, I feel like they do not have time to discuss my medical results fully with me to my liking. For example, I recently had a number of blood tests run and the results emailed to me. I have no idea what the results mean and emailed my doctor to ask what behavioural changes I would need to make to be healthier. I was told that my results indicate that I am health and to eat a low GI diet. I would have appreciated more time to make sure I understand what the results mean versus feeling like I got brushed off. This is the reason that I use Dr. Google... not enough time from my doctor.
2391;1194;u;1;0;nothing to do with them be a good person it in control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'u' is to criticize and condemn the actions of the us government.;the US looks nowadays like an inflated old, very yucky USSR;Sorry to brake the news but the US looks nowadays like an inflated old, very yucky USSR.

It seems since the financial collapse of 2008, banks are afraid to loan money. Even with interest rates as low as they are, providing consumers and the economy this essential service would provide them with the income they need to function.
2393;6386;women only law school;1;1;to be a lawyer get degree woman independent;the intention of the tweet is to refute the existence of women-only law schools.;There are no women only law schools;There are no women only law schools. Womens' colleges, like Mills College, that do offer graduate degrees have co-ed graduate schools. The example of Hillary Clinton's success at Yale Law School either says nothing about womens' colleges or supports them.
2394;17447;national security;1;0;to help the poor be a leader save environment money free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'national security' is to criticize the republicans for prioritizing the free market over national security concerns.;They weren't worried about national security when they were willing to let the auto industry go under;Republicans are all about the free market. They weren't worried about national security when they were willing to let the auto industry go under. If they want to cut programs to fix the deficit they should lead by example and cut these farm subsidies. Let the free market deal with it.

Presidents George W, and Obama's forigen police advisors are a disaster. Iraq and Syria, both brutal dictatorships, and both secular governments where your religion was your own business we could not tolerate. But Saudia Arabia, the bank that funds the genacidal Muslim fundamentalists are just fine. I hope we ""don't do more stupid stuff"", it's getting very dangerous, and very expensive."
2396;10653;kids;1;1;to be a teacher in charge control help the students;the intention of the tweet towards target 'kids' is to express concern about the impact of the law on their ability to adapt to change and hindering their learning and growth.;We are setting our children up to be unable to adapt to change;What will these students do in life when they don't have the ability to opt out of something they disagree with? One of the important lessons learned in schools is that we are different, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. We are setting our children up to be unable to adapt to change. Speaking as a teacher, we are also making teaching an even less appealing profession. We already have to accodomate and modify based on IEPs and languages, and mandated testing. What other profession gets so much input from those outside the profession? Do people go to their doctors and tell them how to treat their problems? Give advice to their lawyers or accountants? Teachers are professionals and should be treated as such. Many of us have masters degrees and just want to work with kids, to help them learn and grow. We are impeded in that by so many factors, and this law is another one.
2397;13436;same-sex colleges;1;1;to be the best win competition a leader game;the intention of the tweet towards target'same-sex colleges' is to highlight the benefits of same-sex education for young women, including increased confidence, competitiveness, and expectations of being taken seriously.;What these smart, no-nonsense young women learn is to EXPECT to be taken;Nope. I, a male, taught at an all girls high school in the 1970s. Then and now I realized what same sex education gives young women, and it ain't rocket science (although that certainly should be prominent in the curriculum). What these smart, no-nonsense young women learn is to EXPECT to be taken seriously, expect to compete on a equal basis with those around them, expect to get the prize when they actually win. Getting along with the boys is not the solution for the girls. It's the problem, friend, it's the problem.

No matter how much blah-blah people from the Cato Institute and other dens of traitors spew, lower taxes or -- Zounds! -- NO taxes on coupon-clipping is a throwback to the days of the nobility expecting us peasant to step into the gutter and touch our caps when their Lordships passed by. Get out of my country, Miron. Go someplace like Monaco. You'll like it better there.

In effect, you have stolen their futures;Marco Saavedra, I wonder about the citizens or legal immigrants who would have received the high school and college scholarships that went to you. What has happened to them? In effect, you have stolen their futures. Now that you have been given the opportunities for an in-depth education, at our expense, will you please go home to help your own countrymen so that they won't try to come here, as your family did, to demand what we need for our own people?

What is the difference? If states want to provide a curriculum and resources to families in the state to use for education in lieu of public schools (as one commenter seems to suggest Alaska does) that makes sense to me. A tax break: no!
2401;18252;marriage laws;1;1;to be a good person citizen moral in control free;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for government non-intervention in marriage laws and to support equal rights for all types of marriages.;government should not be defining morality;Marriage as it pertains to government's involvement is an issue of tax law, entitlement benefits and property rights (especially in the case of divorce), government should not be defining morality. Leave morality to the churches, etc. Either government legally protects consenting adults to enter into any type of marriage and provides equal benefits in such unions, or the government completely removes itself from all marriages.

People need a minimum of privacy, because everyone is a unique person. My way to work and yours (any of you) is inherently different, so why should we all be placed in an environment that assumes otherwise. Even cattle dislike a cattle pen.

Never bet against human ingenuity, especially when survival is on the line. The technology we need to move beyond fossil fuels exist today - wind, solar, efficiency improvements like LED lighting, and especially nuclear power. I can't imagine what technology we will have in 50 years - carbon sequestration, fusion reactors, space elevators, orbital solar platforms - there is no point even guessing, but I am very sure technology continues to outpace population growth, and we continue to solve problems faster than we create them. We might be slow on global warming, but science and engineering are key to survival. As Issac Asimov said, ""I chose solution, I chose technology"""

This ex-American-Brazilian is now just Brazilian (not so bad) and living the high life in Singapore. Greed personified. Dual-nationals don't have a true allegiance to either country. I don't think the United States really needs anyone who wants to hedge their bet on American citizenship for any reason, but we especially do not need jerks to make billions here thanks to the United States and then skip town when the taxes come due. Once they renounce, do not let them back in.

The issue of the extent of racial mixing would have to be addressed -- a topic that the US (particularly the South, where it was rampant) finds extremely painful. Aside from permitting reparations for people who are obviously white, it would open a socially-divisive new polemic on determining who is white and who is black, based on genetics. As a society that is pretty much committed to allowing natural processes to make us, as individuals, as rainbow as we wish to be, reparations would be a terrible step backwards into social identifications based on race.

Herein lies a large part of the problem. We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously? My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with, built a home & cared for a very sick child with no insurance or public assistance at a time when inflation & interest rates on loans were double digits. There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education. So please, stop blaming this GREAT economy (low unemployment, low interest rates, strong markets, easy access, public assistance out the wazoo) & start looking within."

Many that I have met have an extremely shallow knowledge of this category of learning. In contrast librarians have a tremendous base of knowledge that guides not just students but the teachers within a school. Beyond the love books and knowledge librarians empower students to go beyond google, they help students learn differentiate and validate information in the sea of misinformation that characterizes the internet today. Yes teachers and schools can stumble on without a librarian, but it is as if we would ask a child to each McDonalds for a meal everyday. Their education is ultimately nutrient diminished.
2411;7546;sports program in undergraduate schools;1;0;PersonX doesn't like college sports sports. believe in;eliminate college sports programs in undergraduate schools.;college sports should be eliminated;It is a no-brainer - of course college sports should be eliminated. They have nothing to do with education nor with college. They are simply money-machines and training facilities for professional teams. Ms. Tatum from Spelman is right on the money: college sports have nothing to do with physical fitness, except for the few so-called students who participate in those sports. The TV and sports betting world benefit far more from college sports than do the athletes.

First they streamlined operations, then they brought big changes to the way they heat and cool their buildings, even bringing in renewables. Then they brought their influence to bear on the farms which sell to them, requiring that they get smarter about their use of fertilizer and water (economical and environmental benefits). Now they're changing the quality of the foods they sell us, with immense implications for the nation's health and health care. All without a government mandate: conservatives should be dancing in the aisles, alongside us liberals, in encouraging such enlightened self-interest.

There should be no question that state institutions should be able to run publicly paid institutions that reflect the public's needs. Fiscal conservatives don't want to limit government, they just want to outsource it. The private sector is interested in profit. The public sector is interested in fulfilling the public's interest. Without it there is no government. There is only a shell whose surface is big smiling millionaires and high paid lobbyists who don't provide any service other than bureaucracy. Bring the idea of government back.

It is an act of imperial hubris for the United States to judge Cuba's human rights record, and in order for us to take such a judgment seriously we would have to ignore the dismal human rights record of the United States and the massive heap of corpses that US foreign policy is responsible for. The purpose of the embargo, of course, was to ""cause hunger, desperation and the overthrow of the Government,"" and as such is a far greater crime than any Cuba has committed under the despicable Castro regime."

Martin is right when she points out that beauty is complex and highly individual. Beauty contests are yet another way corporations manipulate us into thinking that beauty is something we can buy only if we buy their products. How many beauty contest winners publish novels, make scientific discoveries, or sit in board rooms? Perhaps there is a better way to invest $50,000 in scholarship money than to give it to the person who looks best in a bikini.
2418;3358;wage raise;1;1;to get a raise earn more money be paid make;the intention of the tweet is to argue for wage raises for better workers.;Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers;Len Penzo writes, 'Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?' This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers.

What makes pre-K so important is the teaching of so-called soft skills not offered in kindergarten or beyond. No amount of additional kindergarten is going to offer the valuable intensive lessons in curiosity and exposure to new experiences. Advocates of pre-K aren't simply asking to extend traditional K-12 education by one year, they instead want to give all children the opportunity to learn the non academic skills needed for future success.

Any nation wishing to declare independence should meet three essential elements: a strong central government, control of defined territory and security. "". Well we could also start with some basics about the legitimacy of a government to govern people under its control.

Balance is the key. Whatever style a parent engages in with his/her child, a balanced point of view is preferred. I believe the most important variable is to teach children that they can make decisions. When they are young they learn to make choices, albeit small choices, and as they get older the choices become more significant and important. i think the type of parenting described in the book is extreme and not the best path for parents to follow
2422;19237;extreme parenting;1;1;to be a good parent help the children successful responsible;the intention of the tweet towards extreme parenting is to emphasize the importance of parental responsibility in ensuring a good education for their children.;it is ultimately the parents job to see that their child is learning and getting a good education;Most (American)parents do not realize that sucess and money flows from a good education. The most sucessful ethnic groups do not strive for wealth it flows from having well educated children. And the thing that goes hand in glove with that thinking is that it is ultimately the parents job to see that their child is learning and getting a good education and not leave it up to schools. The teachers and administration will still be recieveing their collective paychecks long after your kids have moved on.
2423;5879;federal tax credit;1;0;to be independent in charge control independent. free;the intention of the tweet is to express opposition to the idea of a federal tax credit for home-schooling families.;No nanny Federal Government for those who choose to do things their own way. And no;May I ask why a Federal Tax Credit is requested for those who home-school when education is a State-based function. States, counties, cities collect the property, sales, and other local taxes and assessments which fund the local public schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks, and many other community-based educational and cultural resources. I am puzzled that those who so ardently shout for the preservation of States Rights seem to be inviting the Federal Government into their home to demand oversight of their children's school curriculum and evaluate their performance. Am I missing something here or is there some kind of shuffle going on. I can see the validity of home-schooling or private schooling families requesting an allowance from local and state taxes where control of the costs and expenses for the vast majority of education resides. No nanny Federal Government for those who choose to do things their own way. And no Federal subsidy for their right to choose.

Business needs ONLY an excess of paying customers and the same rules for all players. With only that they can manage and grow. REMOVE customers ready to pay and no reduction in rules or taxes can sustain business.

When we left I felt discouraged knowing that our work would not have lasting positive impact for the community, but believing we made a difference for individual children. While I didn't stay in teaching, the lessons learned in those years have been strongly reflected in the nonprofit organization I helped found on parenting education. I agree with those that see the value of TFA going beyond the classroom.

For example, I decided to drink green tea in the morning, instead of a coffee latte. Later, I decided to substitute iced water for soft drinks. Another change was whole wheat thin buns for sandwiches, instead of regular bread. Instead of yogurt with lots of calories and sugar, I now eat plain, non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with fresh fruits like blueberries or bananas. Each change was painless and over the years the weight melted away, until I reached a BMI number of 22. I think I would have been discouraged if I had tried to make all the changes in my diet at once. It would have seemed too hard.

Reagan fired strikers, yet this time we're expected to reward them even more? Tax cuts and deals for those who can afford to get most of their income from investing seems to prove one thing - they don't circulate as much of their income as the rest of us do. From the way things are running this far in to Bush's ""temporary"" tax cuts all I can picture is a series of mansions with mattresses high in the air over all that frozen cash. Face it, Mr. Miron. There's no tax bar so low that some of the wealthy wouldn't pay bright people to find somewhere else with a lower rate. I'm picturing a land of negative taxation, and there they'd probably say they needed to be paid more by the populace."

They ARE available in the U.S. But the reason that the electric car is not likely to go anywhere in the next decade or two in this country will be the same reason that Americans do not have 50% of their cars using clean diesel. The SMART car has been in Canada for sometime, but in Canada it runs on a 3 cylinder diesel and gets over twice the mileage I get. But why isn't the diesel version of the Smart car in the U.S.? The clean diesel Smart cars of Canada and my VW Jetta both meet California emission standards. When the U.S. government can explain to the American public why we are so far behind Europe technologically, then perhaps we will move to fuel efficient vehicles. Electric cars in the U.S.A. will have the same fate as 8 track tapes and Sony Beta. Go figure..

Why wouldn't we want as many children as possible to be able to participate in high school athletics? We all know the benefits of sports for kids, why would we want to deny home-schooled kids these same benefits just because they are doing their academic work outside of the classroom?

Most people want to do a good job if they are allowed. Life is about balance and not everyone's balance is the same. Having said that it is important to have a job that is rewarding and to have rewarding time away from work. If you hire good people and treat them like good people you will need fewer rules. The fewer rules, the more nimble the company. Nimble companies tend to survive and prosper. Large behemoths, merely survive, until entropy takes over.

About $40k of my income comes from my salary and $10k comes from investments. For that $40k I get up in the morning, drive to the office and work hard for eight hours every day. For that $10k in capital gains all I do is spend thirty seconds a month transferring money from my checking account to my mutual fund accounts. In my opinion it's offensive to tax money that rolls in with almost no effort at a lower rate than money you have to earn by hard work. Don't tell me that the rich work hard for their capital gains. I know how hard I work for mine and the answer is thirty seconds per month. Tax the lazy.

I have my own business in a cube in an incubator-type space in Manhattan to save on real estate costs. While it's big enough and the walls are 6 ft. high, it's still very hard to do any of my deep thinking/focused-task work there so I often wind up going back at night for several hours to get that type of work done. All it takes is one person with a loud voice to make it difficult to focus; with a few around me, it's impossible. I wonder daily if the money I save is worth it."

This does not make American agricultural interests any more evil than antebellum white Southerns were; just shortsighted and maybe a little mule-headed, like Southerners were and often still are. My advice to the American agriculture industry is to look down the road at how you will be viewed decades from now and get on the right side of history while you can."
2436;20116;technology;1;2;to get a job make money. money be independent;the intention of the tweet is to express concern about the replacement of black workers with immigrant labor, criticize liberal welfare policies, and advocate for stricter immigration laws.;No simply answer;No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights.

I was graduated with honors when I received my Master of Arts degree. I learned more outside of school than I ever learned inside, at least once I learned to read. School tends to be boring for both very intelligent students and not very smart kids. Textbooks are dull. The books in the library and the stores are interesting. Has anybody but me noticed that, although students in other countries score higher than Americans on standardized tests, innovation still comes out of America? Long schools days only take away from dreaming, creating, and inventing. Go ahead and make school days longer--if you want a bunch of robots for citizens.
2438;15963;non-native students;1;1;to be a part of something good citizen person not racist;the intention of the tweet towards non-native students is to highlight the positive results of legal immigration and the negative impact of illegal immigration on their academic performance.;students whose families immigrate legally from Europe, Asia and Africa-but not Latin America;Legal immigration is not the issue. Illegal immigration is the issue. Arguing that legal immigration and illegal immigration together sometimes produce positive results is irrational. We can have legal immigration without illegal immigration. The truth is that students whose families immigrate legally from Europe, Asia and Africa-but not Latin America-to the United States are more likely to graduate from high school than native-born students while students whose families immigrate illegally are far more likely to drop out than native-born students.

Catching and punishing criminals is what the authorities do when they have failed to prevent crime. Unfortunately, profiling tells us more about the criminals among us than we, apparently, really want to know.

That most of the Muslim terrorists in the US were children of immigrants is hardly reassuring. We have more than enough homegrown religious fundamentalists. It is hard to see any benefit to the American people of importing even more.
2444;20640;vaccination;1;2;to be in control make money. money charge a scientist;the author's intent is to express their opposition to patenting isolated genes, arguing it's unnatural and a form of hubris, comparing it to patenting existing organisms in nature.;Patenting particular genes is a perfect example of scientific and legal hubris;"As Horace put it, ""You may drive out Nature with a pitchfork, yet she still will hurry back."" Genes, whether isolated or not, and whether ruled by the Supreme Court to be covered by patent protection or not, will forever remain part of the natural world, not the conventional world (the world we humans construct). No law can overrule nature in this way. While corporations clearly have a case for patenting manipulated (constructed) genes, it goes against the deepest common sense to rule they can patent ""isolated genes"" that already exist in nature merely because they ""found"" them. This is no different from arguing that a naturalist who spends millions of dollars hunting down bats, and then finally stumbles upon a bat deep in a cave in a jungle, should be able to patent that bat. Patenting particular genes is a perfect example of scientific and legal hubris."

Bush or;Studies and statistics have shown that felons who have regained the right to vote and actively engage in the voting process are significantly less likely to reoffend. On that alone, society benefits. Based on past standards for disenfranchisement, neither George W. Bush or Dick Cheney would have been able to vote in years past. Andrew Jackson killed two people in duels. Times change and our standards evolve. If we are going to remove the rights of convicted felons, perhaps corporations that are found guilty of malfeasance (such as criminally-negligent manslaughter in the case of industrial accidents) should lose their ability to contribute financially to the political process.

They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change.

A well educated public is what leads our country to economic success, medical advancements, and a more evolved society.

I think the answer would surprise you. Correlation is not causation - the sooner you learn that, the sooner you can get to the real root of our opiate addition problem.

My wife and I always took our kids on vacations. We all had a great time and I hope that their memories of these trips is as fond as ours are. Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. ""In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!"""

Good teachers are the ones who love to teach and want to be in the classroom for the long haul. Every major newspaper reports of budget cuts to educaion on the local level and of teacher layoffs. It is an insult to hear of hard working certified teachers being replaced by someone who is marking time for a year or two until they get into law school or find something that pays better.
2451;507;social development;1;1;to be a good parent better mother they want help them children learn;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for better education of parents as part of the preschool model to promote social development in children.;preschool standards include socialization skill development;But what happens if the preschool standards include socialization skill development such as turn taking, perseverance, self-regulation through movement and meditation, and other techniques? Also, parents don't always make the best choice for their children. They can be strongly influenced by family and cultural norms, and be in denial of their children's developmental delays. Choice sounds wonderful--who wouldn't want more choice?--but when those choices are based in emotional reasoning and not logic and sound social science, choice can make parents feel good but rob children of what they need. Maybe we need better education of parents as part of the preschool model. Teachers and day care providers can be taught the skills for providing parental education and even breaking through denial to some degree.

The inference by this statement is thus that cigarettes or beer are gateway drugs to marijuana use. What next? Would a campfire or mowing the lawn on a hot afternoon be gateway activities to beer? Under this logic it is plausible. Your position is based on the correlation of relative rates of consumption - not causality."

He so bungled that he left himself out of serious contention for leadership of Fatah. That was his power play to replace Abbas as the useful tool of Israel, and he both failed and exposed himself for the Quisling that he is. Still, the Palestinians never recovered from the coup attempt pushed by the US and Israel. The reaction to this unity attempt highlights the continuing use by them of the division of the Palestinians, the gift of the Quisling that keeps on giving.
2454;3522;public access to beach;1;1;to clean the beach be up respectful;the author's intention towards public access to beach is to advocate for public facilities such as restrooms and trashcans to be provided along with public access.;I have no problem with public access to beaches;I grew up in Malibu and my family still lives there. I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting.

Intellectual sloth, for one. The dumbed-down science and mathematics. The teachers' sloppy grammar and spelling. The language study that never gets beyond tourist phrases and insincere smalltalk.

2459;18382;teaching standards;1;0;to be a teacher the best educated teach;the intention of the tweet towards target 'teaching standards' is to advocate for better training and education for teachers, including specialized course work and ongoing education, to improve the quality of teaching and ultimately benefit students and society.;Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools;Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators.

This did not happen overnight. It was not done in the heat of any political movement. It came about because jurists is many nations realised that it was arbitrary to deprive migrants of a second citizenship but not those who acquired it at birth. Discussion of dual nationality is a distraction. In the current situation, there are better laws available: Deny the new Singaporean a visa to the US. Require him to have a ""sailing permit"" if he does visit and wants to leave. Et cetera. Why does the GOP not discuss those directly applicable laws? And if the Beatles' US income was taxed, why won't the new Singaporeans?"
2463;17032;a smart investment;1;1;to help the poor kids learn children be helpful;the intention of the tweet is to argue that a smart investment in early childhood education, specifically in preschools, can lead to long-term benefits for children and society as a whole.;kids benefit from a preschool environment even if it is all play based;I agree with some of the comments about not pushing kids too young to read and write. However, kids benefit from a preschool environment even if it is all play based. New Zealand has a free preschool program, but the kids don't start learning to read until they enter elementary school and NZ has one of the highest literacy rates in the world. It also benefits those who are in the lower middle class and don't qualify for free programs. This is where we really need to start making a push. So that their kids don't end up in the lower class.

I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it."

The coffee barista;I'm on the side of (at least) minimum wage. But I want to raise a different issue. Since when do we owe the bakery clerk a tip? The coffee barista? Every place you go up to a counter, place an order, pick it up yourself, clear your own table--has a tip jar. Should we have tip jars for librarians? Grocery checkers? Shoe sales people? The whole thing is insane. People should work for wages, and employers should pay them. If that means the product costs more, we have a choice about consuming/buying it. PS I had my days as a waitress. So has my daughter. I understand that if you're paid no wages, you depend on tips--and I tip in restaurants. But I don't think it's the right system.

But I don't want all these people around. My university had these big open rooms in the library. No they were NOT conducive to focused activity. I had a weekly routine. Sunday night 9PM you could login to a website and book a private study room. They ware small (about 50% larger than a broom closet) but they had a desk, a power outlet, a network jack and a DOOR. I was hitting refresh on my browser every Sunday starting 8:59 for four years straight. I know it's not socially acceptable. We're all supposed to love being the center of attention at the party but some of us are introverts and open floor plans will NEVER be comfortable and will NEVER be conducive to anything but misery. And no, you're wrong, there is NOTHING wrong with me.

I know such children, and they are sad. No amount of positive thinking and ""there are all kinds of families"" on the part of the parents can ease that pain. It's really disheartening listening to a kid tell you that, despite many uncles, aunts and cousins, they have ""a small family"", because they have no grandparents... How they wish they knew those grandparents, and wonder what they were like. Beyond covering the basics, money doesn't matter so much to kids, nor does status, nor material things nor travel, but what does matter to them is the people around them. There are all kinds of reasons to delay, but among the ""know what you're doing if you delay"" advice, I think the social circle a child is born into should take high priority - both in terms of the grandparents they may not have, and in terms of the parents who may not even live to see that child graduate from college..."

Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?"" The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses."

2473;12111;illegal immigration;1;2;to get a better job hire foreign worker workers. good;the tweet argues against illegal immigration by stating that foreign workers are not cheaper than americans and that they are required to have a salary at least as high as americans, receive pension and stock options, and can only be hired if no american worker is willing to take the job.;The laws are made against hiring foreign workers and most companies prefer American workers;There is a false perception that the highly qualified foreign workers are cheaper than the American ones. The workers on visa are required to have a salary at least as high as the American ones, and they also get pension and stock options. Moreover, they can only be hired if no American worker is willing to take that particular job that should be advertised in mass-media of large circulation. The process itself is expensive because if requires the services of a law firm. Additionally, if fired, the company should pay the plane ticket back home. During recession years, no foreign worker can be hired as long the company fires Americans. If caught hiring illegals, a company may get into big trouble. The laws are made against hiring foreign workers and most companies prefer American workers. If there are so many foreign workers in high tech companies is because so many Americans with college degrees are not good enough for those jobs.

If parents who home school their children are entitled to;That's hooey. If parents who home school their children are entitled to a tax credit, then what about childless taxpayers who have to pay for public schools? Why shouldn't they receive a refund of the part of property taxes which goes toward local public schools, since they have neither contributed to the costs of operating those schools or derived benefits from them? Both private and home schooling are voluntary, and hence it is a choice that parents make to eschew the public school paid for by their taxes. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay the additional amount for their decisions. If so, then childless taxpayers are entitled to similar benefits.

We are on a greased path to plutonomy, and, within five or 10 years, at this rate, with the only acceptable policy choices being to give the 1% even more, there will be more and more social unrest.
2478;11971;sport leagues;1;1;to be fair everyone a good citizen all person;the intention of this tweet is to advocate for a simplified, flat income tax policy in america, eliminating tax exemptions for any income source.;No one should be tax exempt. Enough of this never ending debate about who gets;No one should be tax exempt. Enough of this never ending debate about who gets favored and who does not. If we are going to tax income in America, we should stop playing favorites and tax every dollar of income exactly the same. Whether earned by KBronson, the NYT, the Catholic Church, the Girl Scouts, or Exxon, we should tax every dollar at the same rate--no matter who earned it or what they spend it on. A simple direct tax policy like that would send this country on a growth spurt that it hasn't seen since the 1950's, and get the government out of our personal decisions.
2479;6159;everyone;1;0;to be a vegan vegetarian healthy in control;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the vegan lifestyle and its strict rules.;The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy;Just wanted to add that I went to a vegan dinner once in CA for people interested in joining the vegan lifestyle. The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules.

It is time for the Times to make a stand for the truth. If you cannot do it on the Middle East, if you cannot do it on Fracking and Climate Change, if you can't do it on Bernie Sanders, you can, at least, do it here on marijuanna.

One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us ""even to reason better about ethics""---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: ""intellectuals"" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is ""intelligent,"" then we're pretty damn stupid. Give me a man who can't do algebra but has the integrity to work hard and care for his family, and I'll show you a better kind of human."

CoEd colleges are not generally ""...gender-integrated places, where no one is excluded and both sexes learn how to respect, collaborate with and lead each other through shared experience."" This is a nice fantasy but it is not reality. I was fortunate to go to an women's college in a curriculum where male students had to come to our turf. So I had the best of both worlds - the opportunity to study with men but in an environment where women's opinions and observations were honored because it was a women's college. PS. Having just finished ""I am Charlotte Simmons"" by Tom Wolfe, I think we have made the mistake of thinking that age is the equivalent of the emotional maturity necessary to live together and study together in a mutually beneficial way. If anything, we should have more segregation of the sexes through the college years - not less."

Because the reward system is skewed away from the very very hard work of the great classroom teacher. I understand that the idea is to use these talented few to create more great teachers. This is not a new model, however; the status quo is largely predicated on it. Make classroom teaching as financially rewarding as staff work and you'll get there. Who stands in the door( like a George Wallace) blocking this kind if revolutionary reform? Da Teachers Unions..."

He is ignoring the obvious evidence that a lot of poorly-educated people do not have the survival skills that our ancestors had. It is probably true that worldwide, a lot of abstract reasoning skills have diffused more widely among the general population, causing a rise in performance on IQ tests. However, when I've taught young people (as a volunteer), I've been astounded at how wide the gaps are between the small proportion of kids who can read and write and think, the largest group, who stumble over the simplest texts and cannot read aloud, and the group who don't even know what reading and writing are. Clearly, something is going on. Pinker is willfully avoiding it, because it's an embarassment to the liberal elite of which he is a part, and who are largely responsible for the decline in educational standards.

Unfortunately, there's nothing third parties can do about that. The last 40 years of failure of the war on poverty, with its $4 trillions spent, should provide sobering evidence to this fact."

Declawing,tail docking,ear cropping,docking cattle and sheep tails,mulesing and all other mutilations of animals for the human caretakers convenience should be outlawed! As for the declawing, have you never heard of The Paw Project? Do you have any idea what declawing does to a cat? What really needs to happen is Human Education ! I've had cats for over 20 years and raised hundreds of orphan kittens and have NEVER had any furniture,rugs etc destroyed by felines. From the time kittens can walk I filed/trimmed claws,have multiple cat trees and scratching posts and cardboard scratching boxes in the house.It is time for Mr. Beck to join the 21st century and start respecting animals.
2488;16542;capital gains;1;0;to be a leader make profit money. money get rich;the intention of the tweet is to refute the argument that lowering taxes is necessary to attract capital, suggesting that a reasonable tax rate is not a barrier to investment for smart investors.;If a business is a good investment, a reasonable tax rate is no barrier to;"This is the old race to the bottom argument: ""If only we had the most business friendly practices, capital would flow to our country."" I, for one, am not having it. If a business is a good investment, a reasonable tax rate is no barrier to investment for a smart investor. By Mr. Miron's argument, we could attract even more capital by paying people and businesses for investing in America, essentially make the tax rate negative. Wouldn't that be grand? Paying the rich to invest in their own country?"
2489;8849;mandatory for all children;1;1;to be safe save lives protect others prevent disease;the intention of the tweet towards target'mandatory for all children' is to argue in favor of mandatory vaccination for all children, citing the potential harm and cost to society if an outbreak occurs.;Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect;Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided.

Great;Taxes do NOT equal tuition, a point many, many commenters and writers miss. All taxpayers pay for public education, because an educated populace is a benefit for the entire society. Homeschooling parents believe they provide their children a better service than the government can. Great, many can. Those same homeschooling parents get indirect benefits from public education: reduced crime, a better economy, and a more cohesive community. They should support the public schools, just as childless people do.

Was it to replace overt racial preferences with similar but less transparent and complex racial preferences? No. It was to eliminate racial preferences. PERIOD. How is this not clear? Those here who openly discuss and plan to subvert the will of the voters based on their personal ideology is a disgrace to our system. You've been ordered by the voters to stop this, so stop it. Now. I support the effort to give any child with distinct socioeconomic disadvantages the pathway to a college education, but I don't support it as solely a means to an end to implement the same racial preferences that were just banned.

The;I can buy 2 (used) Honda Civics for the price of one electric car. The electric car can travel 100 miles on a charge. The Civic can travel 500 miles on one tank of gasoline, the gasline is readily available, and a fillup takes only about 3 minutes. Driving 5000 miles a year, the payback time for an electric car would exceed the life expectancy of the car itself.
2494;18560;mandatory for all children;1;1;to avoid getting sick the disease protect his family children;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for mandatory vaccination for all children.;This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune;My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision.

Israel won;I do agree that it would be bad for Iran, or any other country for that matter, to develop and possess nuclear weapons. That said, where is the cry for Israel to give up its stockpile of nuclear arms? Israel won't even admit to having them in the first place even though it is quite the open secret that they have them. And yet the US gives Israel millions upon millions of dollars in aid year after year. And let's not forget that Iran is what it is today because of a CIA backed coup which removed the democratically elected government and installed the Shah of Iran in order to protect BP's oil wells.
2496;7625;farm subsidies;1;0;to help the poor be a leader save environment money free;the intention of the tweet towards target 'farm subsidies' is to criticize and suggest cutting them.;Let the free market deal with it;Republicans are all about the free market. They weren't worried about national security when they were willing to let the auto industry go under. If they want to cut programs to fix the deficit they should lead by example and cut these farm subsidies. Let the free market deal with it.

Look at the record cold coming up in Raleigh. Look at the devastating consequences of the drought in California. Look at what is happening in Sao Paulo in Brazil. We must get off fossil fuels and we must do it as soon as we can. Drilling for oil off the coast is not the answer. More solar, wind and conservation are the answer. We need to wake up before it is too late for the future of this planet. Our kids are counting on us to do the right thing.

If as is put forth here there is concern over the growing ability and accuracy of China's ballistic missiles the solution needs to be the inclusion of Taiwan in the Aegis ashore missile defense program as well as upgrading Taiwan's Patriot air defense batteries to the latest PAC-3 missiles and associated radar systems. None of this is offensive in nature and only can threaten China to the extent that it reduces China's ability to threaten Taiwan. Not selling Taiwan the latest defense hardware because we are concerned that China will stop selling us cheap consumer products may be a foreign policy but it's not a very wise one.

We learned in the gulf what can go wrong. Well the Atlantic is stormier. So what new technology exists to quickly contain a spill? In the late 1950s there was an oil tanker incident in the Atlantic. All I remember about it is my mother bringing nail polish remover to the beach to clean off the tar balls from our legs.

I was a kibbutznik. I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said ""God does not hear the prayer of a Jew."" Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? ""First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever"" Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States? Carter and Obama try to be fair to both sides, and are excoriated for it."

Iran is not interested in helping the Palestinians. Iranians don't like Arabs. Iran's leaders hate Sunnis. Palestinians are both Arabs and Sunnis. Iran used to have a friendly and productive relationship with Israel. It makes nos sense that this friendship has ended. The most intense and dangerous of all hatreds are those that make no sense. If Iran's mullahs understood that it makes no sense for them to oppose Israel's existence, they could turn Iran into a secure and prosperous country at once.
2502;21065;medical website;1;2;to be a good parent citizen get better education person;the intention of this tweet is to argue for equal tax treatment between home schoolers, private school, and parochial school attendees, emphasizing the role of public education in shaping society and creating a unified citizenry.;Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school,;Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those who send their kids to private or parochial schools. There is no difference. All of these individuals are opting out of the publicly provided education which shapes our society. The purpose of public schools is not only to educate all children, but to create an educated citizenry that will serve our country well, with the shared values of our American society. Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school, or keep them home - are making a choice with their discretionary dollars.

I say, ""Fight back. Blow him up."" When they are willing to call off their shoe bombers and underwear bombers and others trying to blow up my airplane or hijack it and fly it into a building, then I will oppose trying to take out their leaders with drones. While that group of thugs is trying to kill us at home and killing us abroad, I am for taking out their leaders."

As a teacher for 22 years, I can attest to the effort it takes to gain competence and mastery. After years of reflection, feedback, more reflection and refinement of techniques, I am proud of the product given to my wonderful middle school math students. And many people would have said I was pretty good 22 years ago. Would you rather use an automobile mechanic who is untested or the tried and true pro?

Some of the smartest students I've met at Utah State University found that out-of-state tuition at USU is tens of thousands of dollars less than in-state tuition in California. So they came here instead. Perhaps public universities in Utah and California are playing the same game, trying to attract out-of-state residents who will pay more tuition at the expense of admitting qualified in-state applicants. When two states play this game, the state with a lower cost of living wins. As California seeks to attract overseas and out-of-state talent, it should seriously consider where outside its borders it is driving its own in-state talent to go.

His mantra to farmers--""get big or get out""--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture."
2509;20631;home schoolers;1;2;to make money. be rich money get a job wealthy;the user is expressing concern about income inequality and gentrification in cities, using new york city and paris as examples.;i'm against home schoolers;What is happening in New York City is happening all over the world, as cities go out of their way to attract those with the highest incomes and push others to the outer edge. In NYC, the subways started to do that, making sure that bank clerks moved a long ways from Manhattan to the outer reaches of Brooklyn and and Queens. Now even those areas are high-priced. So, off to NJ. It is the European pattern where, as in France, the poorer immigrants are at the far,outer reaches of Paris.
2510;18989;casinos;1;0;to make money. have fun. money fun;the intention of the tweet towards target 'casinos' is to criticize their negative impact on society and argue for them to be a destination resort to ensure those who gamble can afford it.;Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in;it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.

Anything which weakens public schools and their funding will result in the most vulnerable youth of America being left out of the chance to get an education.
2512;13518;air travel;1;0;to save money money. avoid flying. flying;the author's intention towards air travel is to express dissatisfaction with the legroom upgrade pricing and the lack of southwest flights in their area, but also to highlight the positive aspects of flying with foreign carriers on trans atlantic flights.;Because flying has become so unpleasant I do it as little as possible;On my flight yesterday from Seattle to Dulles/DC the legroom upgrade would have been $119, not $39. Where I live, Southwest doesn't fly, so that isn't happening. Because flying has become so unpleasant I do it as little as possible. The only bright spot is the foreign carriers on trans Atlantic flights--a trip to Milan via Emirates last summer was a pleasure, with legroom, edible food and a choice of 500 movies to watch for free. Regulation of things like legroom and full disclosure of fees sounds like a good idea to me.

Diesel cars are 50% of the cars on the road in Europe. They ARE available in the U.S. But the reason that the electric car is not likely to go anywhere in the next decade or two in this country will be the same reason that Americans do not have 50% of their cars using clean diesel. The SMART car has been in Canada for sometime, but in Canada it runs on a 3 cylinder diesel and gets over twice the mileage I get. But why isn't the diesel version of the Smart car in the U.S.? The clean diesel Smart cars of Canada and my VW Jetta both meet California emission standards. When the U.S. government can explain to the American public why we are so far behind Europe technologically, then perhaps we will move to fuel efficient vehicles. Electric cars in the U.S.A. will have the same fate as 8 track tapes and Sony Beta. Go figure..
2514;17679;casinos;1;0;to make money be rich get wealthy;the intention of the tweet towards target 'casinos' is to criticize their negative impact on society and the economy.;To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating;Wealth is not money. Wealth is hamburgers, cars, buildings, all the things we need to live. To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating anything. It is simply taking advantage of the frailties of the human condition to rob people. A caution however... everything has consequences, to build more Casinos is to invite more debt in the terms of social payments to the newly poor who have dumped their life savings into these black holes. The misery caused is also a real effect but our government seems to to be oblivious to misery caused. It seems to work to perfect it.

It seems all too many of us would prefer to push individuals with a criminal record off the proverbial edge over extending a hand to help them regain their footing. Fear may be at the bottom of this pattern of behavior but in my view it only makes things worse in the long run.

So, why so little good research? Blame the federal government which made marijuana research unduly difficult. and similar foreign governments. A Catch 22: little research since marijuana is illegal; illegal party because little research showing it is relatively safe. Somebody had to blow this dam of repression sky high; Colorado has done this. Now, belatedly, the research can go on."

Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more. What a ridiculous presumptuous argument.

However, UN Security Council 2334, just proclaimed Palestine to be Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Clearly, the UN has dropped the Corpus Separatem concept. If East Jerusalem is Palestine, then West Jerusalem is clearly Israel. Therefore, the latest UN Security Council resolution should be used as the justification for moving the embassy to West Jerusalem within the Green Line.

BUT, the other half of the crisis lies with the deregulation (conservatives) crowd. ""See no corporate evil, hear no corporate evil, speak of no corporate evil.""

Any political leader who supports Syrian refugees coming into the U.S. should resign their position immediately if one of those refugee commits any act of violence in our country.

He visited web MD, concluded he might have appendicitis, woke me up at 2 AM, and suggested we go to the hospital for possible appendix issue. He is not a complainer, so I took him at his word. Result: appendix removed at 7 AM. I'm a believer.

In fact I believe I should get a tax break on my income for NOT costing the government extra by having children. Why do parents who choose to have children believe they deserve to pay LESS than I do in taxes just because they choose to breed. It is not as if they didn't know that children cost money to have and raise! Yet because they get a tax break for having them and I don't I am forced to help pay for them! If you want kids and choose to have them then YOU pay for them and don't expect to get your taxes reduced because of it!

Back in the day, I learned Spanish! In retrospect Latin would have been the better way to go, since mastery of that makes learning the languages like French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish, very much easier to learn! I would recommend it, But it's 2016, and let's face it, if you lived in southern Brooklyn today, Russian, Ukrainian, Cantonese, Arabic, and Ghetto Yiddish is the way to go! However, if one lives in the United States as a whole, circa 2016, Mandarin, has got to be the way to go! Who knew?!!! Nixon's The One.

It has been for 3,000 years."" This alone shows that his position is based on fantasy. If Jerusalem had been the capital of Israel for 3,000 years, then the Zionist dream of a new Israel in 1948 would have been mad, for such a state would have been in place for all of those 3,000 years. Until Israel acknowledges that its being is based on a colonialist venture in that the current borders of Israel did not surround an empty space but had been occupied as a non-Israeli entity for centuries, advocates like Mr. Cohen will be living in a fantasy world. Saying something does not make it so. America has bought into Mr. Cohen's fantasies for far too long,"

Obesity causes heart problems, diabetes onset, fallen arches (not a lightweight disability), and a variety of other problems. When I worked as a benefits administrator for a large corporation on the East Coast I saw first-hand the cost of obesity to the obese employee and to the company. Harsh as it may be, companies probably do not hire obese people if they can find a way not to. FYI: obesity does not mean plump or overweight, it means debilitating obesity. How does an obese truck driver get into the cab of his truck? At some point, he can't. How does an obese service technician get down the basement stairs in an old house? At some point he can't, especially if he is carrying his tools. And, when does an obese employee become diabetic, with all attendant problems, e.g. dead tissue on feet. Obesity is not something to defend at all costs; obesity is something to help the obese person treat and become healthy."

Today this small city and its architectural treasures is an international destination for those interested in architecture. Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli. Obviously, none were local.

Ginsberg's comments are refreshing in a way. She seems to be trying to end the hypocrisy whereby judges pretend they don't have a bias towards one party.

The large banks were teetering on the edge of complete collapse just 5-6 years ago. And he's calling these same banks the best run businesses on the planet? Well if I started a business and got huge Federal bailouts when I was at risk of going out of business, I'd do really well too. In my view, the banks should have been allowed to fail for their reckless behavior.

So it should be shared. Why can't the Israelis and Palestinians each celebrate and share their heritage in Jerusalem? Let every nation place its embassy there as an offering of peace and solidarity.

However, I don't have a high income, nor do I make crucial contributions to domestic economic growth. All my spendable income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains. The total is about the reported median Adjusted Gross Income of Federal tax returns. (I have non-spendable taxable income due to converting money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.) I don't think it would be fair for me to pay no income tax while someone with the same amount of income from labor pays income tax. Count me among those who prefer a democracy that is economically non-optimal to a plutocracy that is economically optimal.
2531;15453;education problem;1;0;to be a leader make difference point noticed change;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the actions of activists and politicians who run for school boards and prevent qualified individuals from serving on the boards, ultimately hindering the education of students.;activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards;One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards and prevent people who have the interest and learning to keep the schools funded and educating students well from serving on the Boards. These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts.

I guess it does since the last statement is rather limited, ""Thus, the electric car is not a cost effective answer to all our problems and would not exist without government tax subsidies."" It is not cost effective now. Our crazy-low gas prices are the result of decades of subsidies, not to mention a few wars and environmental costs. Was the light bulb cost effective the first month out? How about the personal computer? Remember the early ones with 250MB hard drives and those gigantic floppies? Things get going, not because they save money right out of the gate, but rather because people see potential in what they may become. Even cranky-pants Cato knew enough Aristotle to understand the subtle relationship between potential and actual."

It is also a scam by some extremist social conservatives to keep women out if the paid labor force. This proposed tax credit should be called what it is--an increase in government spending. Then let the Republicans try to defend it.

I;I have had many clients for the fifty years I was a Psychotherapist and now that I am retired at 88 I still have friends who know that I love them and yet because of my faith do not approve of the lifestyle. The idea that Christians hate Gays is an example of those adding fuel to the fire. Most of my intelligent and gifted Gay friends agree with me that the Gays has created more of the problem than they are willing to accept or change. Gays want those of all religions and different persuasions of faith to feel, act, accept and welcome them when they in turn are not willing to act, accept and welcome those who do not agree with their life style. I believe a Gay person can be a good Catholic, as does the Pope. I believe a Gay can be a Christian, as do most of my friends in the faith, but I can ask a Gay to accept me as a sinner, imperfect and less than God wants me to be. I do not understand why a Gay has to deny that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin. Just accept that.

And what can possibly be the point of having a ""debate' without admitting that Americans are sick of Israel, and why foment a ""debate"" dominated, as most ""american newspaper"" debates now are, dominated by Israelis. Trying to fathom American opinion is not possible. Is it NOT counterproductive to do this phony PR or feel good thing for Israel when American clearly and increasingly sick of Israel and it's troublemaking. The latest constant Isareli screaming to bomb Iran and blackmail America before the election has resulted childish predictable blurbs that don't address or the subject. Who's childish idea was this?"

Most of our driving is only short distances. Spur of the moment decisions to go from SF to LA only happen in the movies. Look at golf courses and retirement communities. The electric cart has almost completely replaced the old gas cart. Sweet quietude and fast charging stations make the difference. Soon no body will want the smelly, costly, breakdown prone gas guzzlers that Detroit wants to make. As used cars they will soon be all junk while electrics sail along and along and along.

Common colds are examples, and legitimate sites will give you symptoms to help tell the difference between a cold and a more serious condition and will invariably say if these symptoms do not go away in a week or so, consult a doctor. We should not discourage use of legitimate health sites. What we should do is to encourage medical experts to review, monitor and give feedback to sites and tell consumers which are the best ones.

If terrorists are under no such ""legal obligations,"" it would seem that drone operators are not bound by them either!"" So, if my neighbor breaks the law, then I get to do so also? I cannot believe that anyone would argue that ""someone else is doing evil things"" so therefore there is no reason for the US government to behave in a moral and lawful way in the world.

First, and foremost, because that same significant percentage of Palestinians would not accept a sovereign state without first seeing the end of Israel. And Britain should be ashamed of accepting a circumvention of civil liberty by accepting any form of sharia law into the British legal system. What moral cowards do is of no consequence to the well being of western freedoms.

If Wall Street con men are still able to vote after crashing the economy, oil company executives are still able to vote after polluting the planet, and lobbyists are still able to vote after bribing our politicians, then it seems only fair that poor people arrested for theft or using drugs should be able to vote, too.

Absolutely, not only for them but also for their children;I hold dual citizenship as do two of my three American born children. One has a UK issued EU passport and the other an Irish one. Advantages ? Absolutely, not only for them but also for their children. And as for my motive in taking out US citizenship after 37 years here on a green card - very simple. I was trapped in Europe 9/11 and had an overwhelming need to go home, home being the US. That singular event and ensuing xenophobia clarified for me that the US was indeed my home, that I wanted to vote. On a lighter note, producing that EU passport at the dreaded Heathrow Airport a couple of weeks ago smoothed passage through that bottleneck! For my children, my dream is that they retain a link to their heritage from both sides of the pond, that they are citizens of the world, good ones at that.

The new program will benefit all;My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful.

I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been. The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand.

In particular ""I have the gold I make the rules"" is the relationship of master and servant. If you want your kids to quit school and be waitresses or bartenders to get you off their back keep repeating ""i own you until you pay your own bills"". If you want a lawyer, a Doctor an MBA or a Phd in the family you have to learn to respect their autonomy while still providing support. Respect for autonomy starts early and grows as the child grows. The years between 13 and 18 are critical. The child has to learn self control and you have to learn to let go and respect your childs autonomy. Otherwise there is an explosion when they hit 18"

We also took them on a driving tour of New England to see things like Mystic Seaport, Plimouth Plantation and Salem. When they got older we took them to the Grand Canyon, Europe and Japan, but they helped plan our vacations and so we made side trips to Meteor Crater and Legoland in Windsor. The kids are now grown and living in different states, but they still ask to take family vacations with us. These trips a good way to reconnect, but it is also clear they have given our kids first hand knowledge and real appreciation of the wider world.

A retired RN, with more than 7 years of a 3-decade career spent in hospice care, I have concerns about the future of opioid control of pain in that spectrum of medicine if draconian measures, as a result of inappropriate prescribing resulting in addiction and death, are implemented that restrict or make onerous the availability of drugs appropriate for the terminally ill. I absolutely agree that physicians should be trained, intensively, in the appropriate use of highly addictive analgesics, both for acute, chronic and, especially, diseases of the terminally ill. Please, whatever course you advocate, do not throw up roadblocks to terminal pain relief. (I intend, NYT Comments reviewers permitting, to copy and paste this comment to all five discussions. I wish only to reach the widest audience. Glen)

Of course, one might ask for some data in lieu of the directive to the reader to conduct a survey, but perhaps more glaring is the assumption that the ""experienced"" teachers are in a position to know. Are they disinterested so as to be in a position to judge? Isn't their response likely to be purely subjective? Formerly a college professor, I rarely have met a high school teacher who I thought was sufficiently educated in his or her subject to be teaching it. I would say a masters degree in the field doesn't cut it, certainly not at the high school level, and a degree in ""Education,"" of any sort, from BA to PhD, definitely doesn't qualify anyone to teach at any level, from kindergarten to graduate school."

Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse.

The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought.

Oh wait, I'm thinking of Wall Street. We're discussing casinos? Well, I guess we can say that casinos are a really fun way to pay stupidity taxes. Yes, that's it. As your money disappears you can, like a cat, watch shiny things go around in circles and bat at them.

It's not about painting the walls of the delivery room a pretty color or having rocking chairs in the room. It's about informed and healthy women in control of their birth choices. Let us be clear, this guy's lifestyle is based on insisting that women deliver in hospital attended by a surgeon. So his opinion is not unbiased."

These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts.

Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII."

2576;20027;vaccination;1;2;to protect his country be safe a leader safe.;the intention of this tweet is to advocate for stricter and more balanced immigration policies, particularly for refugees, emphasizing the importance of keeping them closer to their home countries.;No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants;The issue is not whether refugees are good people or not -- rather the concern should be that those fleeing war in Syria should not all be going to Europe. A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants. Nations can and should have workable policies on immigration, capable of being followed and enforced. THis is an issue quite separate from that of terrorism, and one that has been a major political issue in the US for decades already.

It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need. I would homeschool but I need to work to pay my school taxes which have quadrupled in the past six years. Social skills learned in school? Seems like I spend every waking moment trying to undo the social skills my daughter is ""learning"" during school hours!"

That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around.

By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012.

It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague.

If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.

Don't want sales employees to 'poach' clients? Keep the employees happy through good treatment and keep clients happy through relationships that go beyond the single sales person. I'd be willing to bet that every manager now trying to institute non-competes got to their current position by competing effectively up the ladder. Isn't honest competition the American way? Why should labor markets be allowed to dodge what all other markets are required to promote- competition? Just do your corporate job right, that's how you earn corporate success, not by limiting the career paths of employees after they leave you. The only legitimate use of these limitations would be in the area of trade secrets.

I grew up in a time of air raid drills and ducking-and-covering under my desk at school. A time of the Missiles of October, when the whole world held its breath to see whether the Russian fleet would turn from the blockade. We may have small scale conflict around the world, but we don't have children hiding under their desks anymore, or wondering whether that siren they hear means Russian bombers are on the way.

Yes, but not only because of what happened in Paris! As much as these refugees are in a really bad situation - people seem to forget that there is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. For different reasons, these immigrants have not integrated into society, refuse to obey local laws and as a group are very hateful and intolerant towards others. You can either call me a racist or a realist - the facts are very hard to ignore. Anyone who thinks that these refugees will be different from those Muslims already in Europe is dreaming - allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe. It is fine to want to help the refugees - how about the Arab countries in the region? I haven't actually seen any Arab countries offering help - or is that heresy?

It's not the teachers. It's the parent;First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life. Everyone is afraid or too embarrassed to say the truth.

That, of course, assumes a former employee can afford the cost and hit to his reputation for bringing lawsuit against a former employer for an onerous non-compete. You mention these agreements protect the business owner, but I fail to see how they benefit the other party in the agreement, the employee, one iota. A more equitable arrangement would be to require the business owner to pay a premium for preventing his employees from selling their services in a free marketplace."

It offers what is called ""Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)"" which amounts to lifetime unrestricted visa without expiration. OCI holders advantage is that they are not stopped at the exit point of the India's airport for proof of payment of income tax. OCI holders can not participate in any electoral process in India.

I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full."

2595;21652;afghani insurgent;1;2;to make money. a profit living money;the intention of this tweet is to question the focus on keeping fruit cheap and landowners rich, at the expense of american workers and fair labor costs in the agriculture industry.;afghani insurgent;"Dr Gallardo says: ""Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples)."" Now let's ask what Dr. Gallardo has avoided telling us: ""What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost."" In most agriculture, land rents, the landowners' profits are the major chunk of full costs. If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down, bearing the brunt of the increased cost of labor. There is no reason fore the land to disappear. There are not that many alternative uses. It's not like farmers, who claim to have built the land with their own two hands, will stop building land. Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich? Why is that a fair policy? And who among the Times six ""experts"" (including ""immigrant advocates"") is here to represent the interests of American workers who are required to work for less because of illegal immigration?"

The Senoi Indians believe that our dream state is really the other side of our wakeful state and that the two are equal in importance. I have learned so much from my dreams. They are sometimes frightening, but I see even these as some sort of cathartic experience that I am learning from, albeit perhaps on an unconscious level at times. Dreams can actually help keep us sane. They are a means to process what we may not want or know how to process in our wakeful state. That is why the Senoi made it a practice to discuss their dreams every morning. Sort of like a ""Tell me about your night."""

2599;3453;religious deeds;1;1;to be in control a leader righteous help others;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the idea that faith alone is sufficient and to emphasize the importance of religious deeds.;faith without deeds is dead;"In James 2:14-26 Paul writes: ""What good is it... if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, ""Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,"" but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead... Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds... You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder... a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone... faith without deeds is dead."" Don't blame Christianity for her fanatical and cruel spiritual materialism"

A dunk requires no skill, it just requires the right genes. And for added fun make another line farther out than the 3 pointer, why not have a 4 point shot?

He seems to have a problem with no-show reservations made through an online reservation service that costs him money. It seems to me that he is missing the concept that having his restaurant appear online, either on Resy or Opentable, amounts to advertising to the general public. On Resy, it is the customers, not him, who pays for the advertising. He seems to be heading toward the idea of making his restaurants more like dinner clubs for regular diners, and also VIPs, whoever they are. (Maybe he means the VIPs are the people who pay for a reservation.) Well, good luck with that. At the restaurants I like it seems they treat everyone who walks in the the door as a friend or a VIP, even when they apologize and put you on a waiting list to be seated.

If we give them an inch, they'll take a mile and then it'll be a breeding ground for terrorists over there just like Afghanistan was. We have to go after radical Islamists when we have the opportunity.
2603;3164;your cat;1;1;to hurt the cat animal be mean cruel;the intention of the tweet towards 'your cat' is to inform and persuade against declawing as it causes severe pain and stress, affects walking and causes behavioral issues.;It's mutilation not convenience. It's cruelty, pure and simple;Declawing should absolutely be illegal! It's not just nail removal, it's amputation of the third distal phalanges, or toe bones. It causes severe long lasting stress and pain. It puts the cat walking on its second toe bones, which are not meant to bear the full weight of the cat, causing muscle and tendon damage. It's the number one reason cats turn to biting and pottying outside the box. Many cats wind up in the pound because they were declawed and started biting or going outside the litter box. It's mutilation not convenience. It's cruelty, pure and simple.

Once children start driving they get addcted, doing it almost every day for the rest of their lives. They get irritable when driving privileges are taken away from them. And the danger ! We have plenty of research and $$$ have been spent on drunk driving education, yet people still drive drunk ! This is a crisis that can only be solved by throwing people in jail.
2605;20496;parental involvement homework;1;2;to be a teacher the best educated teach;the author advocates for improved teacher training and education standards in the us to reduce social inequality and boost economic progress.;a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education;Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators.
2606;14513;palestinian;1;0;to be in control a leader charge power;the author's intention towards the palestinians is that they are likely to respond with violence to any move made by israel or the us, making it unwise to pursue such actions.;violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything;Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians.

Think how well we could be living now if we hadn't deforested our lands, polluted our waters, degraded our soils and overtaxed our aquifers and rivers. Would the middle east seem so intractable a problem if there was still plenty of water and arable land available; if the population of the region was just a fraction of what it is today? Think of the vast advances civilization made in the first and second millenniums with less than a billion people living on this planet. If birth control had been practiced earlier in our history would we be any less advanced a civilization?"

What the other writers do not seem to grasp is that we the taxpayers fund airports, TSA, the roads to and from the airports, many of the employees, etc. In that sense, we have a vested interest and a right to know what is really going on. Shopping for fares on the internet is a joke-- usually when it comes right down to it, the buyer has to choose the most expensive option as that is the only workable arrangement.
2609;11559;medication;1;1;to get rid of pain be a good doctor something;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the media for not being allowed to mention certain medication names and to express frustration with the medical profession for not properly managing medication prescriptions.;Doctors shoveled Hydrocodone at me after my back operation, 240 pills,;Why are the trade names for these medications suddenly taboo in the news? Are the reporters for some reason not allowed to say Percocet, Vicodin, Hydrocodoe, suddenly, just like they were not allowed to say 'torture' . And of course, training is required. Doctors shoveled Hydrocodone at me after my back operation, 240 pills, and I needed exactly zero. It was weird. Not only that, an intelligent nurse took me off hydrocodone while I was in the hospital, saying it was not having a good effect on me, and that should have guided the exit prescriptions, also, instead of just getting the xerox copy from the already written doctors wrote orders. Doctors are not allowed to divorce their brains from their profession, despite the obvious example Ben Carson showed us of what type of skills make one a top surgeon.

Employers pay people as if they're worth nothing, but force them to sign non-compete contracts because they might have the know-how to ruin the company's business. If that isn't worth something, what is? Maybe those small business owners should find better ways to encourage people not to walk off with trade secrets, like treating underlings with respect, paying a living wage, and sharing the profits. Might help.

PERIOD;What was the voter's intent in Michigan, California, and Florida? Was it to replace overt racial preferences with similar but less transparent and complex racial preferences? No. It was to eliminate racial preferences. PERIOD. How is this not clear? Those here who openly discuss and plan to subvert the will of the voters based on their personal ideology is a disgrace to our system. You've been ordered by the voters to stop this, so stop it. Now. I support the effort to give any child with distinct socioeconomic disadvantages the pathway to a college education, but I don't support it as solely a means to an end to implement the same racial preferences that were just banned.
2612;7881;labor conditions;1;1;to make money. money be a leader save get rich;the intention of the tweet towards target 'labor conditions' is to criticize the exploitative working conditions and low wages in the cotton industry, and to suggest that the demand for cheap labor is driven by greed rather than necessity.;The idea that you have to have a captive labor force, poor working conditions and starv;This is similar to the question could the south have abolished slaver before the civil war and still be able to grow and harvest cotton at a competitive price. The idea that you have to have a captive labor force, poor working conditions and starvation wages is born out of greed not need. Big business drives illegal immigration and the transfer of American jobs to China. An increase in the regulation of farming hiring practices, especially corporate farming and a high enough foreign profits tax to make bringing jobs home worthwhile would surely improve the employment numbers.
2613;13469;public higher education;1;0;to be a good citizen person leader fair;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the importance of public higher education and the need for state legislators to continue funding it.;The solution is what it has always been: wise and forward-thinking state legislators have;The country is better off having two strong systems of higher education, publicly supported and private. Weakening one (under the unrealistic assumption that the monies fried up will be given to state institutions, and not the state Medicaid or roads program) is not a solution. The solution is what it has always been: wise and forward-thinking state legislators have generously funded public colleges.

THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable."

That's the first thing I thought. Her thoughts on Merrick Garland were very appropriate. The Senate refusing to have a confirmation hearing under the Obama administration is an outrage. More than that, not having Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court is a wasted opportunity for our country. If you are acquainted with the legal system, you can appreciate the years of hard work Judge Garland has put in honing his redoubtable intellect. In addition, he has already provided a lifetime of public service. He richly deserves to be on the Supreme Court. The United States would be a better place. Professor Chemerinsky, you were so insightful during bar review, and you are right on target here.

Hasn't the west already learnt from the removal of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi from Iraq and Libya respectively and what it has done to those countries? The USA is responsible for the creation of ISIS in a passive way as it is also friends with Saudi Arabia. The removal of Assad govt will lead to a stronger ISIS and a bigger problem in middle east. The removal of the Assad govt is being sought mainly because of Israel while it bombs the hell out of Gaza killing thousands of people. Working with the Assad govt is a smart thing to do. Don't fix it if it ain't broke.

Hepatitis B? HPV? Be my guest--that choice only affects your family, because those are not diseases your kid can spread at school, on the bus, etc. But no one without a medical exemption should be able to opt out of vaccinations against HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, very dangerous diseases like German measles, pertussis/whooping cough, mumps (which can leave little boys permanently infertile), etc. Measles can live on surfaces like classroom desks and the metal handles people hold in buses for several hours. Nobody has the right to expose complete strangers to devastating diseases that are so easy to prevent.

2623;2062;eating habits;1;1;to be the best in control charge leader;the intention of this tweet is to express frustration and criticism towards people who impose their lifestyle choices on others, while also questioning the relevance of diet and lifestyle on longevity and expressing skepticism about certain published content.;omnivorous, obese, and lazy;Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care.

As long as that remains true (and it is true), Roger Clegg's argument remains invalid. There are very many poor people in prison for non-violent crimes that were prosecuted while the defendant was too young and too poor to pay for legal representation. Many of them would not have been convicted of felony crimes if could have afforded a competent attorney. Thus, the blanket denial of suffrage for all felons cannot be justified.

Most shoppers and commuters and soccer moms will find the electric sedan more than practical, and it could be fashionably stylish too.

This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America.

Civil workers are generally paid less but they get full benefits packages. Overall the cost is far less than subcontracting to a much higher paid layer of executives who take that money and then wine and dine the government hacks who make the decision on contract renewals. It's rife with corruption...

Withholding pain meds because suffering is good for ya - that's not just imperfection, that's malpractice.

Why are so many people still pointing to Europe or Japan as if they are producing the world leaders? They are not.

Don't stress my kids with this utopian idea - send your own kids to summer school.

People are working longer for less pay. Benefits have become a thing of the past. Fire-at-will policies keep people under even more stress. The fact that people are making the best of their bad situation speaks to the resiliency of the human spirit far more than it is a defense of our new American serfdom.

Yes, getting international students is nice, promotes American values, brings money into the country, etc. etc., but let's ask a nasty question: if an applicant is coming from abroad and will pay full freight for whatever tuition bill the university hands him, what incentive does any school (state, private, whatever) have to create financially livable conditions for students and provide financial help to American kids to avoid a debt-filled future? We have not had enough of a debate on this question.

There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more. What a ridiculous presumptuous argument.

It seems an ideal arrangement, as they & I balance the great opportunities in the US vs the great benefits (free health care, great affordable higher education, stable economy, banks, etc.) as well as opportunity in Canada. I & they can choose whichever course/country seems best. Meanwhile, we are each happy to support (with taxes) whichever country we are living in.
2637;2064;religion;1;0;to be the best in control charge leader;the intention of this tweet is to express frustration and criticism towards people who impose their lifestyle choices on others, while also questioning the relevance of diet and lifestyle on longevity and expressing skepticism about certain published content.;The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over;Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care.
2638;4233;librarian;1;0;to get a better job good new grade;the user expresses concern about perceived declining intelligence and work ethic in society, attributing it to factors like technology and education.;i have actually had office personnel who literally could not file- did not seem to understand the;My personal experience is that people are getting dumber. In the last few years, i have actually had office personnel who literally could not file- did not seem to understand the alphabet. This was unheard of twenty years ago- at least with the alleged degree of education some of these people have. During this recession, which to me does not seem to be over, i have been astounded at the many people hired who do not understand that if i want them to do a certain job, they had better perform it or they won't have a job! They are actually shocked when fired, even when given several verbal and written warnings. And of course i see typos every day in the print media, and not just low quality media either, although i suppose it is due to lack of editors or an over-reliance on spell-checker. i am getting more forgetful because of age but i still seem to have a better grasp of general things then the kids half my age. Maybe their brains are disturbed by all the things they are exposed to at much too young an age- like television or texting.
2639;796;opinion;1;0;to stay out of politics be left alone trouble independent;the intention of the tweet is to question the relevance of a spouse's opinions on a presidential campaign.;It is possible that the spouse of a Presidential candidate, although educated and a professional;It is possible that the spouse of a Presidential candidate, although educated and a professional, living a non-political independent life, would have nothing noteworthy to say about the campaign? A spouse could have strong opinions about numersous topics and insight into the character of one's spouse, but still not be in a position, or inclined, to opine on the relevant aspects of a Presidential campaign.
2640;10932;public school funding;1;0;to be a good parent citizen person have education get better;criticize public school funding.;Now that my kids are out of the public school system I should not have to pay the;Let me understand this. Now that my kids are out of the public school system I should not have to pay the 80% of my property tax that goes to support my local schools? Or do I get a credit for supporting services that I do not use? Has this been thought out sufficiently? It seems that there is an equal protection problem here.
2641;21849;intestate student;1;2;to be healthy a leader healthy. safe;the intention of the tweet is to raise awareness about the health issues faced by american children despite their high vaccination rates.;American children are the most heavily vaccinated in the world;The United States of America is the most advanced country in terms of childhood vaccination. (that means, American children are the most heavily vaccinated in the world) And yet, more than half of that most vaccinated U.S. children suffer from chronic illnesses or obesity. Have you ever thought why? Wake up Americans.
2642;5739;royal couple;1;0;to be independent independent. have a family save money;the user expresses criticism of the royal family's expenditures and perceived extravagance, and disagreement with unmarried couples living together.;William and Kate should pay for their own wedding;I agree. The royal family needs to be taxed and pay their own bills like everyone else. Their decadent luxurious lifestyles are ludicous and outdated especially when the UK is facing severe austerity measures. William and Kate should pay for their own wedding. They are not indigent. The royals could make a fortune selling exclusive wedding photos to the tabloids. Personally, I cannot understand why couples live together before they get married when the research shows that they are more likely to become divorced than those couples who don't. I am old fashioned and think that marriage is a sacrament. I think that William and Kate are setting a bad example like all the other celebrities and other heterosexual people that are living together without being married.
2643;18230;national security;1;1;to make money. money a profit get rich.;the author expresses concern about farm subsidies favoring large-scale corporate farms, negatively impacting smaller farmers and promoting nationalist enterprises, while questioning the sustainability of commercial farming.;Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and;"As the son of a farmer, I reluctantly agree with the author's conclusion. Farm subsidies grossly reward a small-percentage of large-scale corporate farms and businesses, which now operate on scales in vast disproportion to the revered Jeffersonian single-farmer business. Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and diesel production/ports; a very nationalist enterprise in an era of which America is the self-proclaimed champion of global free markets and force tariff removals. There are only two kinds of farmers: those selling their land and millionaires...there is little in-between in this industry...which also can no longer survive in a free market...commcercial farming has, in the words of a famous person, become 'too big too be allowed to fail.'"
2644;5365;obesity in surgery;1;1;to help the poor be a doctor obese save lives;the author's intention is to express concern about the obesity epidemic, particularly among women, and propose that employers, including medical professionals, should discourage obesity, starting with themselves.;I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women;"I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese ""he could not earn a living (sic!)"". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid."
2645;4871;illegal immigration;1;1;to be a good citizen person have secure country society leader;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for stricter immigration policies and a secure country.;We need a secure country, not just a secure border. We need mandatory use of;We need a secure country, not just a secure border. We need mandatory use of E-Verify and laws making it illegal to stay in the US without an valid visa and mandate that ICE has to deport. Unemployment, especially among young, is horendous. I do not like it, but I will trade Dream Act for secure country. But I will not give away amnesty without changes going forward.

There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change. They don't care that the US is broke and we have lots of problems at home. They have their eyes fixed on getting rid of Assad and they don't care about the US at all.
2647;780;big banks;1;0;to save money money. be rich independent;criticizes big banks for collusion and high fees.;apparent collusion between major banks to charge similar fees and stifle true competition;I'm beginning to see that up here in Soviet Kanukistan, we have it REALLY cushy when it comes to the banking industry. There is open, honest competition between banks for the customer's business, for one thing: not apparent collusion between major banks to charge similar fees and stifle true competition!! I pay $8.5 per month, get free debit services, free checking, 10 ATM transactions per month, and my overdraft fees are only $5 per shot (thank goodness, lol!!). Most ATMs charge $1.5 for transactions not associated with their sponsoring banks and even the private ones only ask this much. I remember visiting the USA in 1998 and simply refusing to pay $3 just to use an ATM!!!! The USA is the richest country on the planet, with the hugest bank profits... looks like exploiting the poor and vulnerable in their society is one of the ways they GOT so rich in the first place.

I would even say they are needed now more;This news made me sad. One of my mentors in graduate school, the late Denah Lida, was a professor at Sweet Briar and I always heard good things about her time there. No, women's colleges are not irrelevant. I would even say they are needed now more than ever (see former NYT article on Wellesley).
2649;3637;middle east;1;0;to win the war be in control a leader charge;the intention of the tweet towards the target'middle east' is to express a lack of interest in the conflict and suggest that the british, french, and turkey should take action instead.;Not our fight. What is the objective? How would we know when we have achieved that objective;Not our fight. What is the objective? How would we know when we have achieved that objective? Who really wins? Al-Qa'eda again, would be my guess. The British, the French, and Turkey all have the ability to project military power in the Eastern Mediterranean. Let them go after Syria, and let them bear the consequences. To be fair, I only worked in U.S. embassies in the Middle East for 10 years, and have only studied the Arabic language, culture, and politics for 27 years, so I might not know what I'm talking about.
2650;5211;business;1;0;to be prepared save lives helpful help;the intention of the tweet towards target 'business' is to criticize the reliance on private industry for disaster response and advocate for the role of fema in providing centralized command and experience-based planning.;There are problems that normal businesses simply don't prepare for;We cannot depend on private industry to instantly know the best way to intervene in a disaster. There are problems that normal businesses simply don't prepare for - being cut off from supplies, having to work with only the employees that are able to show up, keeping track of things with no computers. This is what FEMA is FOR. They plan for this. They rehearse. They have experience with prior situations, and learn from each one what worked and what didn't. Why should communities re-invent the wheel? FEMA knows how to tap the local resources and guide them in how best to help. There HAS to be a centralized command structure so you don't end up with 25 truckloads of drinking water and no food. Do they always get everything right? Of course not. But I'll take my chances with an experienced crew over even the best intentions of someone trying to figure things out as they go.
2651;8685;slavery reparations;1;0;to be treated fairly compensated. compensated free;the intention of the tweet is to argue against slavery reparations, stating that slaves were also slaves in africa and that the descendants of those brought to the usa would need to prove they are worse off living under boko haram. the tweet also questions the method of apportionment and whether payments should be based on skin color or african dna percentage.;damage was done and the descendants of those who were brought to what is now the USA would need;??? Reparations??? OK that means damage was done and the descendants of those who were brought to what is now the USA would need to prove they would be better off living under the Boko Haram. Keep in mind -- those who were slaves in the Americas were also slaves in Africa -- and were under the Islamic slave trade when sold to the Triangle Trade merchants. Thus slaves=slaves and they again need to show they, via their ancestors, are worse off by not having remained slaves in Africa. Then to there is apportionment ... would payments be made on the percentages of African DNA ? ??? or just based on skin color ??? Most people with African slave ancestors also have a larger percentage of DNA from Europe. Thus, only the slave percentage warrants consideration in the discussion -- the European portion is not due anything.
2652;3956;nations;1;0;to be left alone in control a leader charge;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the international community for not moving on from the recognition of jerusalem as israel's capital, and to suggest that they are stubborn and misguided in their beliefs.;The stupidity and hatred that allows them to believe Israel is the cause of all things Middle East;"""Moreover, once recognition is granted, the international community will heave a sigh of relief and move on, leaving it to the Palestinians to get their act together against a backdrop of Israeli noncompliance and nonacceptance of this move."" If the international community (Who is that anyway? The UN? Grass-roots activists?) haven't moved on by now, they never will. The stupidity and hatred that allows them to believe Israel is the cause of all things Middle East is as tenacious as mold, and twice as pungent."
2653;17936;assad;1;0;to be a leader in control help the poor power helpful;the intention of the tweet towards assad is to use his offer to stabilize eastern syria as leverage for progress elsewhere.;The US has dealt with unsavory characters before.

An approach to Assad offering to stabilize Eastern Syria by defanging ISIS could be used as leverage for progress elsewhere. The perfect is the enemy of the good, especially in the Middle East.
2654;9471;kids;1;1;to be in control charge teach their children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'kids' is to criticize the idea of catering to the needs of parents who do not like anything and assigning a teacher to work with them.;such people are often narrow minded and ignorant, and want to keep their children the same way;Obviously they SHOULD NOT. Such people are often narrow minded and ignorant, and want to keep their children the same way. How a state would write such a law says something about the sickness of their legislature. How about parents who DON'T LIKE ANYTHING? Will the school have to write an entire curriculum for them and assign a teacher to work with this child and teach whatever worthless nonsense the parent's desire?
2655;3037;school community;1;0;to be self sufficient independent independent. learn;the intention of the tweet towards the target'school community' is to express disagreement with the idea of home schoolers being part of the community when it suits their needs.;A public school is a community and home schoolers want to just be a part of;Of course? Why? There are dozens of things I pay taxes for that I cannot do myself. The parents of home-schoolers made their choice. A public school is a community and home schoolers want to just be a part of the community when is suits their needs. Sorry, not fair.
2656;10179;computer education;1;1;to learn a new skill how write be able something;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for more time spent on computer education instead of handwriting practice.;Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or;I'm amazed that so many of the comments on this piece seem to be comparing the usefulness of cursive to other forms of handwriting. I think this ignores the larger point, which is that hand-written print is largely dead outside of school. Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or grammatical structure is wasted in my opinion. Today's students are not going to write on the job. They're going to use a computer. And if anything we should be spending *more* time teaching them to use said computer instead of learning how to write things long hand--a skill which they will never use.
2657;924;financial aid;1;1;to make the right decision best choice;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the use of family wealth or income as factors in college admission decisions, and to advocate for financial assistance for successful applicants.;Both are appropriate in deciding whether to assist a successful applicant financial assistance;Family wealth or lack of it is not a valid indicator of capability for college level academic study and is inappropriate, as is family or personal income, for use by a college or university in deciding whether to offer an applicant admission. Both are appropriate in deciding whether to assist a successful applicant financial assistance. The two decisions are not logically related, and attempting to combine them is certain to lead to poor results.
2658;16593;vote;1;1;to make a point be leader understood noticed;the intention of the tweet is to criticize headlines that question the importance of student votes in elections.;Of course students' votes matter in an election. Everyone's vote matters;"Who writes these headlines? Of course students' votes matter in an election. Everyone's vote matters. In this data-driven world we sometimes forget that the numbers are made up of real individuals with individual wills and individual votes. Analyzing voting blocs is no doubt important to campaign strategists, but headlines like ""Do College Students' Votes Really Matter in an Election?"" are counterproductive and demoralizing."
2659;7139;nutrition being confusing;1;1;to be healthy healthy. eat food;the intention of the tweet is to express confusion and concern about the complexity of nutrition and the lack of transparency in the food industry.;The whole world of nutrition is a mind field for most;The whole world of nutrition is a mind field for most. Most of our meats are and fowl are raised in a manufactured environment. We have no idea what these animals and fowl are fed or injected with. We assume our vegetables and fruits are free of pesticides, who knows. Then of course we have fructose and sugar in almost everything produced for consumption. Labels are simply mind boggling as they will state ingredients, but there is no reference compared to what. Example when you see the sodium content, the culprit of High blood pressure , what % is dangerous?
2660;15378;reparations;1;0;to get away from slavery rid of be a slave owner make point;the intention of the tweet towards target'reparations' is to argue against the idea of reparations for slavery and to suggest focusing on contemporary issues instead.;Nobody paid my family any reparations. Move on!;Blacks sold blacks into European/American slavery. The African tradition of slavery still persists in many parts of Africa. Mauritania leads with an estimated 10-20% of the population in slavery. Move on liberals ..... focus on today's slavery and the cultural issues that face Africa. How about focusing on today's sex slavery in the US in most major cities. Modern efforts to atone such as the Pigford Settlement are a total embarrassment and an under-reported scandal costing taxpayers $4-5 Billion. BTW - My family never owned slaves but a dozen of my family members fought in the civil War with two being killed, one in Savannah after the march to the sea and one on the second day of Gettysburg. Nobody paid my family any reparations. Move on!
2661;4837;social networks;1;0;to be a good parent have time better fun;the intention of the tweet towards social networks is to encourage parents to disconnect from their own social networking addictions and focus on genuinely interacting with their children.;disconnecting from their own social networking addictions;Parents can start by disconnecting from their own social networking addictions and not diving into their cell phones every 3 minutes. Leave work and the world behind! Parents need to genuinely interact with their children, otherwise what's the point of taking the family somewhere new if everyone is simply bringing along their own 'entertainment bubble'? Take children to where they can really interact with real people or nature, not the plasticised, calorific worlds of ghastly theme parks and the like. For city kids especially, how about a farm vacation, where they can see how food is raised?
2662;9542;trump presidency;1;0;to be strong independent free get away;the user expresses disappointment in someone's reaction to a potential trump presidency, suggesting a desire for resilience and patriotism in political adversity.;but I was disappointed that she would state a desire to flee the country in the face;She has a right to say what she thinks I suppose, but I was disappointed that she would state a desire to flee the country in the face of a Trump presidency. That doesn't show much resolve, toughness, love of country etc., god forbid he wins but we would all need to be strong lest the country devolve into what we have always feared it could whenever we hear the hate spewed by some of our fellow citizens.
2663;9242;children raised by elders;1;0;to have a family be in control save money children;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that children raised by elders are more beneficial for the family and society.;older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial;"Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls ""two birds in a nest"" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund. The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be ""cut out?"
2664;5469;working class;1;1;to be a racist get job rich make money;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the target 'working class' for being ignorant and lacking regard for the american lower class.;she has no regard for the American lower class and is ignorant of those unlike her;Like Mitt Romney, she has no regard for the American lower class and is ignorant of those unlike her. Newflash: lots of Americans do not graduate college, or even high school and could do the manual labor commonly done by immigrants. Watch any kitchen, landscaping, roofing, tree trimming, nonunion construction or day labor crew and see if you can spot anyone who is not an illegal immigrant other than the boss who is enjoying paying them below minimum wage, with no benefits, under the table.
2665;19675;marijuana gateway drug;1;2;to make a living money. money get job;the author's intention appears to express observation and make a generalization about racial roles in labor, suggesting a perceived preference or assumption about certain ethnic groups doing specific types of work.;I note Lations are doing most of the manual labor task;Most places I personally have occasion to visit, I note Lations are doing most of the manual labor task. Our family recently built a large home in Austin. As we watched construction all craftsmen including those who constructed a large complicated swimming pool area where all Latino. Both the home in Austin and another in Palm beach Gardens Florida I note, all the garbage collection , yard maintainece, pool service, house cleaning, is all folks of Latino origin. I also understand while I haven't ever seen it, most of our frutis and vegtables are harvested by Lation's, as are our meat and poultry processing plants. What does this tell us? It tells me blacks and white people either wont work for these wages, or won't do that type work.

Lower the rims to let all players dunk.;Think out of the box. Lower the rims to let all players dunk. The bigger the player,the more he would have to worry about hitting his head on the rim. The lower rim would decrease the advantage of tall players and even the playing field for players of all sizes.
2667;19614;mandatory child;1;2;to believe in something be a scientist informed;the intention of the tweet towards target'mandatory child' is to express concern about the loss of critical thinking skills and the tendency to blindly accept information without questioning it.;I feel a lot of people have lost the ability to be an informed s;"All very true but I feel a lot of people have lost the ability to be an ""informed skeptic"" i.e. know when something doesn't seem plausible and be willing to do the work to investigate further. Just look at the controversy over established science for example. It seems to me that lots of folks search out information that conforms to their own viewpoint and accept that, regardless of evidence to the contrary. ""I saw it on the internet, it must be right!"""
2668;3162;housing market crash;1;0;to make money. get rich. money a profit;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the actions of the bank ceos and the government's response to the housing market crash.;Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of;The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago.
2669;4724;freedom of speech;1;1;to be free mean hurt someone people;the intention of the tweet towards target 'freedom of speech' is to question the validity of the concept when it leads to hate crimes.;At what point does the concept of free speech become a hate crime?;At what point does the concept of free speech become a hate crime? The Nazi regime started out burning books written by Jews and then we know where that led. Taken to an extreme, burning of books is just the opposite of free speech. It empowers ignorance by destroying the written word. Sadly, this is an example of someone committing a dumb, but not illegal, act. Is it really freedom of speech or an example of intense hatred? Should that person be fired for his actions, off duty? Probably not in our society. Is this an example of American society, at its best? Definitely, NOT.

Gee, an all these centuries women have given birth at home. Some of us even chose to do so. I'll be sure to let my healthy, happy, offspring know they are the product of junk science. And they should believe it's true because that's what two male doctors who profit from hospital births said."
2671;18832;happy hour;1;1;to have a good time be person friend citizen make point;"the intention of the tweet is to suggest a change in the title of ""happy hour"" to ""last call for happy hour"" to better reflect the event's purpose and duration.";the bartenders are what makes a good social Happy Hour interesting and enjoyable;I agree that the bartenders are what makes a good social Happy Hour interesting and enjoyable. We have all witnessed historically what happened during prohibition when the government deemed alcohol evil and a family wrecker. Bans do nothing but encourage the forbidden behavior, it's in our social DNA. Maybe the law makers should focus on the title: Happy Hour. An hour is 60 minutes and most places I've seen Happy Hour extends from dawn to way past dusk. How about a Last Call for the Happy Hour title not the event?
2672;15439;education;1;1;to be a leader make difference point noticed change;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the actions of activists and politicians who run for school boards and prevent qualified individuals from serving on the boards, ultimately hindering the education of students.;One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists;One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards and prevent people who have the interest and learning to keep the schools funded and educating students well from serving on the Boards. These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts.
2673;4532;pot;1;0;to get high high. make money. have fun;the intention of the tweet towards target 'pot' is to express the negative impact of drug addiction and the role of the criminal justice system in perpetuating the problem.;He is not blameless but the laws of our land that punished without any hope of rehabilitation certain;I have personal experience in this matter. My son started using drugs when he was in his teens. He got into trouble with the law and served time in prison. When he started to get his life back together he found himself unable to find a job because of his record. This had a devastating effect on his life. He worked in the underground economy which is a sure ticket to trouble. He got off drugs, married and had a son. But he relapsed and lost what little he had gained. Flash forward to the present: last September he was found dead in his apartment of an overdoes of heroin and fentanyl. He had been plagued by depression and self-medicated. Although he had hundred's of friends, and was considered a great person, he couldn't fight the demons alone. He is not blameless but the laws of our land that punished without any hope of rehabilitation certain conspired to keep him down.

It didn't take long to pick up the basics, but 42 years later I'm so much better and more consistent. I know how to be more generous and more demanding at the same time, and I know how to catch the fragile students before they tune out or disappear. And the need to innovate doesn't come from the teaching style du jour: it comes from a continuous involvement and pleasure in getting better at what you do.Experience counts.
2676;1294;drone;1;0;to be in control charge power free;the intention of the tweet towards 'drone' is to question the legality of drone strikes and suggest that if terrorists are not bound by the rule of law, then drone operators are not either.;"If terrorists are under no such ""legal obligations,"" it would seem that drone operators are not";"""Is there any evidence that those terrorists targeted by American drones are in compliance with the rule of law? ...... If terrorists are under no such ""legal obligations,"" it would seem that drone operators are not bound by them either!"" So, if my neighbor breaks the law, then I get to do so also? I cannot believe that anyone would argue that ""someone else is doing evil things"" so therefore there is no reason for the US government to behave in a moral and lawful way in the world. The America I knew in my childhood is DEAD."
2677;13473;illegal drug cartels;1;0;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the relentless campaign of kevin sabet and his role in maintaining the markets of illegal drug cartels.;professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long;Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012.
2678;7551;political corruption;1;2;to be a good person citizen get rid of people make point;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the assumption that the number of prosecutions by the department of justice is an accurate indicator of political corruption.;Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth;"Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call ""corruption"" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a ""you wash my back and I'll wash yours"" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible."

Slaves are inherently disenfranchised and all felons are slaves. This fact should not continue to be ignored.

Part of that is due to hold overs from the slavery period. Part of that is due to a perception of minimum wage or less work. What we really need, and are seeing in some of these younger farmers, is a new class of people. People who are extremely intelligent, very hard working, who understand mesh networks, cellular and microbiology, organic chemistry, geology, hydrology, pest control, and synergistic relationships. And we need to get the word out that that's what this new age of farming is all about, and not using ignorant, illegal immigrants.
2683;11551;medical websites;1;1;to get a good grade the job done better;the author intends to criticize the medical system, particularly the financial incentives for doctors, and encourages patients to be more proactive and skeptical about their healthcare.;I sincerely believe that I would have died many years ago had I not done my own homework;I sincerely believe that I would have died many years ago had I not done my own homework, researched my doctors' counsel, and found their advice wanting. Just remember: In most cases, a doctor's compensation is based, essentially, on just one variable: The quality of forms submitted to third party payors, such as Blue Cross or Medicare. If the form looks alright, the doctor is paid, Whether you live, die, get better, don't get better or drop dead five minutes after you have exited the doctor's plush arrogant office, is really quite besides the point. Patients: Don't be so patient.

They don't seem to care one way of the other. China will continue its its one party state regardless of what happens with Cuba. So will the Saudis. So will Putin. Cuba is a small issue in a big world. but in a nation that prides itself on personal freedom, it is bizarre to restrict my personal right to trade or travel unless we are at or near a state of war - or have a similar national security concern. With Cuba we have no such concern. And unlike many other places in the world, Cubans don't have a knee jerk hatred of us. (So let's instead stop trade with Pakistan!)
2685;13702;tax credits for home schooling;1;0;to get rid of taxes have a better education save money money. be independent;the author's intention is to argue against tax credits for home schooling, stating that it would lead to an unfair distribution of tax credits and ultimately result in the elimination of public schools.;it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?
2686;2356;capital gains;1;1;to get rich be help people;the intention of the tweet is to propose a new tax policy that would eliminate taxes on wages and salaries and raise them on capital gains, with the goal of boosting economic growth.;Eliminate taxes on wages and salaries, and raise them on capital gains;We've given tax breaks to the wealthy for 30 years now, and the economic benefits that were supposed to have flowed from such breaks have not materialized. So how about something new? Eliminate taxes on wages and salaries, and raise them on capital gains. Then the people who actually buy the goods and services produced by businesses will have the money to plow back into the economy. The rising tide of workers should then lift all the boats of the capitalists, no?
2687;18564;health clinics;1;1;to avoid getting sick the disease protect his family children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'health clinics' is to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and the potential consequences of not being vaccinated.;My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite;My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision.

They may want to get into business fields where the law degree and some knowledge is helpful. Many students not adept at test taking make wonderful lawyers, not for research perhaps but as litigators. Law Exams in California go for three days and they are very tough but the best top schools have high percentages passing as they take Bar Review courses for a month or so before the actual three day grind. Only graduates from the top law schools with the best grades get the jobs with the giant law firms if that is what you crave you better have passed the bar the first time out. Passing the bar takes hard study and determination. The Law is not a profession for sissies.

The commodification of everything, the thimble-witted emphasis on turning everything, including research universities, into a ""brand"", is precisely the problem. The fact that high-stakes college athletics are in synergy with this larger trend is no recommendation in their favor. As to the idea that ""there is no going back"", well, that's pretty feeble, too. In 1988 in Moscow I'm sure that most people, including everyone in the Politburo, would have told you that the Soviet system in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe was so firmly ensconced in power that ""there's no going back"". And had you talked to them three years later?"

Two reasons. One, Malthusianism does not hold, since resource production can go up exponentially too. Two, the population will peak out at 12-15 billion or so, when it will start to shrink, as it has been doing in Europe for decades now. Uncontrolled extrapolation is a trap to avoid.

All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways)."

I have had 3 births, the first 2 were in the hospital, and my 3rd was at home. I had awful experiences in the hospital with feeling like my freedom was taken away. I felt like I was shackled to the bed from the moment I walked in. My home birth was by far the best decision I have ever made. The experience is almost indescribable. Don't get me wrong, my first 2 births are special to me only because it was the moment my beautiful children came into this world. I just wish I knew then what I know now. With my home birth, I had an absolutely wonderful midwife who monitored me, but also aloud me to have control and let my body do what it was meant to do: give birth. Pregnancy is not a sickness, and I refuse to allow it to be treated as such.

The correct questions should be: 1. Who and what else do these bankers control besides the Big Banks? 2.

Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births.

I feel as though I am one of the few left of my age (and in general) who have not been sucked into the smartphone (mostly iphone) world. It can be very frustrating for me when my friends are constantly glued to their devices. I often find myself in social situations where everyone in the room are on their phones and I am left sitting, waiting for someone to come back into the real world in order to have a conversation or to decide on something to do other than stare at a screen. In this sense I agree that smartphones/facebook can be potentially damaging to relationships or at least to proper social conduct.
2701;18745;a harmful atmosphere for gays;1;0;to be accepted accepted. understood inclusive;criticizes harmful attitudes towards gays.;The idea that Christians hate Gays is an example of those adding fuel to the fire;I have had many clients for the fifty years I was a Psychotherapist and now that I am retired at 88 I still have friends who know that I love them and yet because of my faith do not approve of the lifestyle. The idea that Christians hate Gays is an example of those adding fuel to the fire. Most of my intelligent and gifted Gay friends agree with me that the Gays has created more of the problem than they are willing to accept or change. Gays want those of all religions and different persuasions of faith to feel, act, accept and welcome them when they in turn are not willing to act, accept and welcome those who do not agree with their life style. I believe a Gay person can be a good Catholic, as does the Pope. I believe a Gay can be a Christian, as do most of my friends in the faith, but I can ask a Gay to accept me as a sinner, imperfect and less than God wants me to be. I do not understand why a Gay has to deny that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin. Just accept that.

Some of these practices that Ms. Chau engaged in are nothing short of child abuse, plain and simple. There is no question that structure and discipline are necessary components of childrearing, but to justify belittlement and punishments such as she describes, is to advocate abuse. She is lucky she was never reported to an abuse registry. Her parenting style is devoid of soul, and most likely will be replicated by her children upon the next generation. But what, in fact, have you truly created? Does this advance the cause of humanity...or robotics?

We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot.

The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. ""Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat"". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article."

A time restricted none compete that's enforced through compensation by the former employer who wishes to restrict the employee seems like reasonable protection for both sides. The employee can't work for a year or two in their most lucrative field but the employer who wishes to restrict them pays them a portion of their lost wages for the period of enforcement. A free market for goods and services includes labor. A none compete does more than protect intellectual property it suppresses wages and creates a sense that the employee is property of the employer if they wish to stay in the field were they have the most experience and potential value.

Do home-schoolers only patronize home-schooled;EVERYONE uses public education. Do home-schoolers only patronize home-schooled plumbers, or nurses, or telephone repairpersons? Public education makes possible what we all live with in this Res Publica. Private education is a step back to the 17th century. Mexico is a good example of where the no-tax, limited government crowd wants to go. Having lived in Mexico for four years, where public education is severely underfunded and anyone who expects to get ahead is determined to use private education, I can attest to the benefits of a good putlic education system.

On my part even when the service is less than stellar I tip generously regardless. Serving the general public is a very hard job and deserves consideration especially if one can afford the extra.
2716;5356;student support;1;1;to be a teacher get job teach the kids helpful;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration with the lack of support for teachers in low-performing schools, particularly in the inner city.;The teach for America kids were great but their motives were 'on to bigger and better;Thank you! I taught for nine years in Watts at one of the lowest performing schools in Country. The teach for America kids were great but their motives were 'on to bigger and better things' Not one of them stuck around after a year or two. Further, I felt they were treated,more often than not, as warm bodies to fill staffing shortages. Which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing but there appeared, at least in the situation I observed, to be absolutely no support for them once they were in the classroom. It was kind of like dropping somebody into a combat situation with no arms training. In the inner city situation you need more than academics. You need classroom management skills.
2717;14841;jewish;1;0;to be happy. a success happy successful independent;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'jewish' is to express pride in jewish heritage and upbringing.;I am Jewish. I was raised by loving parents who wished me the best and allowed me;I am Jewish. I was raised by loving parents who wished me the best and allowed me to explore my desires. I had two Ph.D.'s by the age of 24. I have three children, one a MD-PhD, one a JD, and one a horse farmer. All did as they wished- I told them to do it well- Period. Life is too short for the helicopter parenting I see in my Asian colleagues. Be happy, eat dessert first, life will be over before you know it.

Anyone who has worked on the border, or in Mexico (as I do), knows there are plenty of middle and upper-class Mexicans who come to the U.S. for an education. I think Dr. Lee is really perpetuating stereotypes here. In my opinion, affirmative action should be based on economic class, no matter what the race.
2719;5599;drink;1;1;to be a good person better not get sick. writer;the intention of the tweet towards target 'drink' is to criticize the behavior of maureen dowd for not educating herself about the effects of consuming alcohol.;420-laced candy car;I imagine that Maureen Dowd's column, written after she ate a whole 420-laced candy car, is the impetus for this Room for Debate. I found that column astonishing. In this day and age of the Internet, for Ms. Dowd not to have educated herself a teeny-tiny bit felt more like behavior contrived to produce a compelling column than behavior in the real world. All I could think of from her column was the old Alka-Seltzer commercial. There are always going to be people who drink to the point of vomiting/hangover their first time out. They learn. And I bet if Ms. Dowd does it again, she won't eat the whole thing.
2720;6172;asl;1;1;to communicate with others someone people be understood;criticizes asl as a burden rather than a liberator.;ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its useful;"I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be."
2721;8644;a bad deal for cities and states;1;0;to make more money money. be in charge;the intention of the tweet is to argue that privatizing government-run industries is a bad deal for cities and states.;privatize any industry that was once run by government it will, in the long-term,;We must all understand that when we privatize any industry that was once run by government it will, in the long-term, cost us more money, while taxpayers will have less oversight of those industries. Why? Because profit is added to the economic paradigm, (in lieu of non-profit management). Once a profit margin is figured into the economic model that was formerly a not-for-profit entity it will eventually cost us more. Plus, corporations have rights to privacy, so the public has little access to how their prisons, water treatment facilities, and the like are actually being run and managed.
2722;2663;your cat;1;1;to be a good pet owner get rid of the claws problem cat;the intention of the tweet towards 'your cat' is to inform that adopting a declawed cat may have unintended consequences and scratching furniture is a natural behavior of cats.;If you don't like scratched furniture, cats are not for you. You have;I am from the UK where declawing is outlawed. I had never heard of a declawed cat and moved to the USA in 1999. After Hurricane Katrina, there were a surplus of cats and dogs for adoption at our local shelter. I adopted two cats not knowing that one had declawed front paws. It took away the defenses of the declawed cat against the cat with intact claws - though he did like to get the clawed cat in a headlock and scratch with his hind paws. If you don't like scratched furniture, cats are not for you. You have to deal with the whole animal, not just the parts you like.
2723;11104;israeli;1;0;to be treated fairly in charge power a leader control;the intention of the tweet towards 'israeli' is to criticize their beliefs and actions regarding zionism, civil rights, and treatment of non-jews.;They hate the arabs, just look at the recent 'lynching' of pal;The israelis have a strong conviction that they are the chosen ones and are entitled to zion and to all the support provided by the US. They do not appreciate what is given to them by the US, but expect it. They hate the arabs, just look at the recent 'lynching' of palestinian by israeli youth. Reminds me of the US before civil rights laws were enacted. When will the civil rights of non-Jews be respected in Israel? When it ceases to be theocracy (never).
2724;10889;isis;1;0;to be in control power a leader the gain;the intention of the tweet towards target 'isis' is to warn about the potential danger and harm caused by isis and to urge immediate action to prevent it from consolidating its power and spreading its ideology.;"ISIS kills helpless minority ""pagan"" Yazidis and devi";"ISIS kills helpless minority ""pagan"" Yazidis and ""deviant"" Shias. It ethnically cleanse Christian minorities, it uses Yazidi women as sex slaves, it advocates genital mutilation of women, it kills innocent civilian hostages, it attracts starry eyed Muslim radicals from all over the world to join the new ""Caliphate"". It is a anti-civilization evil force that thrives in nihilism and wanton destruction. ISIS is Al Qaeda on steroids. Today it may not yet be an immediate danger to the US but it would be tomorrow once it consolidates its grip on the ""liberated"" region, its ""Jihad"" veterans would return home in the western countries like the UK, France etc and spread the mayhem there, it would plot from its ""Caliphate"" to repeat many more 9/11 until the ""western world is brought under the Caliphate"". It may or may not succeed in that ultimate goal but its methods would surely result in deaths and destruction all over the world including the west. Question is does the civilized world want to nip it in the bud now or let it fester like the Al Qaeda before it is too late to prevent major acts of terror?"
2725;20752;foreign student admission;1;2;to be a good doctor able prescribe in control;the intention of this tweet is to express concern about inappropriate opioid prescribing practices by doctors, advocating for better training or potential consequences for negligent behavior.;Somebody needs training or maybe they just need their licenses pulled!;I see no reason why this has to be an either or situation. Doctors should be trained about the prescribing of opioids as it is apparent that they are either ignorant or negligent in their prescribing practices. Imagine a doctor having the ability to check to make sure a patient isn't getting more than one prescription for an opioid by going to a computer and looking it up but chooses not to....is that good medicine? Somebody needs training or maybe they just need their licenses pulled!

At some time or another, except for Native Americans, we were all ""anchor babies"". My question is how can Republicans (many of whom are ""anchor babies"") lobby to eliminate ""anchor babies"" to introduce themselves into women's wombs, and to prevent young people from competing in the world economy by denying them access to science, still support ""small government""? When will a crowd arise that shouts, ""this Emperor has no clothes!"""
2727;7193;middle east;1;0;to be in control avoid conflict. neutral. conflict;the intention of the tweet towards the target'middle east' is to criticize the us's perceived unconditional support for israel and its negative impact on us interests in the region.;US has to stay neutral between Persian, Arabs and the Israel to be able to pursue;"No doubt about that!! I am a Turkish guy living in the US. I can see both sides of the argument. In my opinion, US has to stay neutral between Persian, Arabs and the Israel to be able to pursue its influence in the region. Right now common belief is US is unconditionally supporting Israel and this is hurting its interest in the Middle East. Remember this: Jews (Israel) and Muslims (Arabs, Iranians...) have been fighting for centuries, nobody can stop that. So, why would you position yourself in the middle of the conflict you know nobody can win. I think the answer is; because strong American Jewish lobby, Middle Eastern Warlords and the US Weapon Manufacturers want that way..."
2728;121;iran nukes;1;0;to be in control power a leader helpful;the intention of the tweet towards 'iran nukes' is to criticize iran's possession of nuclear weapons while also questioning israel's possession of nuclear arms and the us's aid to israel.;where is the cry for Israel to give up its stockpile of nuclear arms?;I do agree that it would be bad for Iran, or any other country for that matter, to develop and possess nuclear weapons. That said, where is the cry for Israel to give up its stockpile of nuclear arms? Israel won't even admit to having them in the first place even though it is quite the open secret that they have them. And yet the US gives Israel millions upon millions of dollars in aid year after year. And let's not forget that Iran is what it is today because of a CIA backed coup which removed the democratically elected government and installed the Shah of Iran in order to protect BP's oil wells.
2729;3292;a tax break;1;0;to educate their children be independent save money money.;the intention of the tweet is to oppose a tax break for homeschooling.;Homeowners without children pay school taxes too, while never utilizing the system;NO. Absolutely NOT. If a parent (a *qualified* parent) wishes to homeschool their children it should be at their expense, sam eas any private school. They do not have the right to financially undermine the public school system. Homeowners without children pay school taxes too, while never utilizing the system.
2730;18196;public school teachers;1;0;to get a job make money. money be successful;the intention of this tweet is to criticize teach for america, questioning its impact on public school teachers' status and its value as a program, given its low retention rate and the brief tenure of its teachers in the profession.;The vast majority of TFA teachers don't stay in the profession, so the job becomes;Teach for America has done nothing for public school teachers's status. The only thing it has done is fetishize its own image, to create a trendy CV filler for cossetted Ivy Leaguers. The vast majority of TFA teachers don't stay in the profession, so the job becomes little more than a balm for their conscious before they move on to JP Morgan Chase and like-minded capitalist enterprises. It takes more than two years to become a good teacher, so if TFA has such a low retention rate for its students, how can it be rated a success? The fact that admission is difficult doesn't mean its a good program.

As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

2732;4668;university;1;0;to live in a city be good citizen the independent;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'university' is to criticize the university for not paying taxes to the city that provides the land.;a university that pays no taxes;Here's one for you... Try living in a city (new Haven) that no longer has manufacturing base and the bulk of land is owned by a university that pays no taxes. It creates a city that is completely split along university and townie lines... and not to the good. Taxes should and must be paid to the city that provides the land
2733;2387;standardized testing;1;0;to be a lawyer get job become the successful;criticizes standardized testing in law exams.;Law Exams in California go for three days and they are very tough but the best top schools;Not all who study law want to practice law. They may want to get into business fields where the law degree and some knowledge is helpful. Many students not adept at test taking make wonderful lawyers, not for research perhaps but as litigators. Law Exams in California go for three days and they are very tough but the best top schools have high percentages passing as they take Bar Review courses for a month or so before the actual three day grind. Only graduates from the top law schools with the best grades get the jobs with the giant law firms if that is what you crave you better have passed the bar the first time out. Passing the bar takes hard study and determination. The Law is not a profession for sissies.
2734;11229;workers;1;1;to make people miserable others unhappy be successful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'workers' is to criticize the idea that many jobs make people miserable and argue that it is not true, as it would lead to workers leaving their jobs and ultimately harm the company's prosperity.;If you make workers miserable then they will not be working there for very long. A company cannot;Not being miserable sets the bar pretty low, so why do so many jobs make people miserable anyway? -------------------------- The thing is that there is no evidence that this is so. If you make workers miserable then they will not be working there for very long. A company cannot prosper doing that.
2735;21204;changing height basket;1;2;to be a good citizen stay in the country loyal patriotic;the intention of this tweet is to express the value and commitment of dual citizens or green-card holders who comply with us tax laws and maintain their status, despite potentially wider corruption opportunities overseas.;i'm not a fan of the changing height basket;Dual citizens are a big asset to any country, but especially to the US. Since US tax laws require all citizens (and also green-card holders) to report all their worldwide income and economic activity to the IRS every year, and pay US tax on any otherwise non-taxed items, any dual citizen, or green-card holder, who does not renounce his citizenship or green card, is actually a very dedicated and valuable citizen for the US to hold on to. Since the level of corruption available to taxpayers overseas is generally very much wider than in the US, dual citizens are exhibiting a very big commitment to the US when they hold onto their dual citizenship.
2736;15118;iranian threat;1;1;to be in control keep the peace power charge a leader;the tweet argues that the 'iranian threat' is a fabricated excuse used by likudniks to hinder the peace process and maintain support from worldwide jewry.;The so-called Iranian threat is just a smokescreen employed by the Likudnik;The so-called Iranian threat is just a smokescreen employed by the Likudniks both in the U.S. and Israel to shove the peace process onto the back burner. Israel always paints itself as living under an existential threat in order to galvanize the support of worldwide Jewry. If Isreal were to make peace with its neighbors the diaspora would lose interest and emigration from Israel would increase. This is why the Israelis continue the occupation of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the blockade of Gaza.
2737;16849;japanese attendance;1;1;to enjoy the experience show appreciation be appreciated happy;the intention of the tweet is to praise the outstanding service in japan.;the service was uniformly, 100% outstanding no matter what city or village I was in, no;I just returned from 3 wonderful weeks in Japan. Part of what made it wonderful was not that I didn't have to tip (I was told it would have insulted service personnel), but that the service was uniformly, 100% outstanding no matter what city or village I was in, no matter the type of service establishment. The whole experience was a delight.
2738;20107;tip;1;2;to be in charge make money. get a promotion money;criticize the incompetence of managers in private contractors.;it's no cure for the real proble: incompetent managers;Been there, done that, worked as a civil servant along side private contractors. Sadly, Nicole Gelinas has nailed it: it's no cure for the real proble: incompetent managers. And, surprise, surprise the managers always keep their jobs after private contractors displace the civil servants doing the grunt work. Somebody's got to mismanage all those contractors, right?
2739;19660;veganism;1;2;to save the planet environment world make a difference;the intention of this tweet is to express a positive outlook on humanity's ability to adapt and innovate in response to population growth and resource management, while encouraging optimism and care for the environment.;We will adapt as needed and when needed;Golly, have I been transported in time? Malthus still with us? Maybe we could avail ourselves of Mr. Swift's Modest Proposal. All these people are nattering nabobs of negativism. We will adapt as needed and when needed. Scolds are likely to have just as much effect as Malthus. Keep inventing. Continue creating. Some of those who are being created will figure out how to adapt. We should take better care of our planet and its resources and we will. Not fast enough for some and too fast for others, but solar is on its way, our automobiles use less fuel and have reduced emissions and we're conscious of the need for preservation of woods and forests. Whine less and wine and dine more.
2740;16497;center for immigration studies;1;0;to know the truth be informed facts understand situation;criticizes the credibility and research methods of the center for immigration studies.;Does the Center for Immigration Studies actually study or conduct research on anything, immigration or otherwise? I;Does the Center for Immigration Studies actually study or conduct research on anything, immigration or otherwise? I don't think so. So why is this group, which contrary to actual principles of research and study has already drawn its conclusions, invited to give comment on a perfectly legitimate question? I am a liberal but I've known people who can no longer fine regular employment in the construction industry because those jobs now go to immigrants who are paid lower wages and offered no benefits such as workman's comp. Many readers on the right and the left understand the many social benefits of immigration but have a reasonable worry of wages being driven further down in an economy in which the rewards seem to go almost exclusively to the top. Real, thoughtful debate or commentary from credible, nonideologically driven sources would be appreciated by NYTimes readers.

If it was arbitrary to begin;"""when peach baskets were nailed to the railing of the running track at the Springfield, Mass., Teachers College one day in 1891, they were hung at 10 feet -- because that was how high the railing was.""

2742;14482;a problem;1;0;get a better job people to be safe happy;the intention of the tweet is to suggest a solution to a problem.;Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally;Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also.
2743;21200;economist;1;2;people to be safe a scientist doctor free;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'economist' is to criticize their stance on vaccination and its impact on others.;John Stewart Mill defined freedom as all inclusive except when it infringes on that of;"NO CHOICE ! John Stewart Mill defined freedom as all inclusive except when it infringes on that of others. So, if parents decided not to have their children vaccinated... OK. But this choice puts others at risk. It has been said that certain vaccines or combinations of them lead to autistic spectrum disorders based on anecdotal evidence. Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the ""false cause and effect fallacy."" And in the present case this is what exactly is going on. And there is agreement about this in the medical and scientific community. Students in high school and college who take biology, chemistry, physics... are apt to learn just facts in favor of what the scientific method is all about."
2744;13557;athletics;1;0;to be the best in charge a leader control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'athletics' is to criticize the hypocrisy of those who demand participation in athletics while opting out of community effort in education.;Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football?;"Where do we go with this? If families who don't believe in public schools can enjoy the athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education period? Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football? Or, for that matter, someone who wants to attend one school but wants to play ball at another? The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, ""You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it."" If this doesn't disgust you, fine, no one's gonna die. But it is yet another reminder that we will never be a community as long as groups of people don't want any part of a shared effort."
2745;46;farm;1;1;to grow food make money get rich more;the intention of the tweet towards target 'farm' is to raise awareness about the negative impact of current farming practices on soil fertility and the need for sustainable farming methods.;we are farming everything that can be farmed;Also, and usually not acknowledged, is that we are slowly eroding the fertility of the soil. There is no more usable soil, we are farming everything that can be farmed. Current methods depend on petrochemical fertilizers. Even with their use, fertility is slowly declining. As human population continues to grow, the result is obvious.
2746;11264;mandatory in college;1;0;to learn a new language be able communicate understood by others good citizen;the intention of the tweet towards target'mandatory in college' is to argue against the requirement of a foreign language in college, stating that fluency is not necessary and that the ability to communicate across language barriers is valuable.;I have a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. According to other comments on this article;I have a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. According to other comments on this article, I have no use for a foreign language - yet I'm fluent in two and can get by in two more. It's enabled me to work easily with multinational contractors, to better understand supply chains and logistics in Europe because I had to LISTEN more closely when it wasn't presented in English, to be perceived as a good representative of the US - not as someone who insists on English only and someone who pretends that speaking English LOUDER suddenly makes it comprehensible to non-English speakers. Even if a person never achieves fluency, the ability to try to reach across the language gap is invauable as a life skill. I use it quite by accident/coincidence every time I visit New York.
2747;1036;capital gains tax;1;1;to help the poor rich get rich.;the intention of the tweet towards capital gains tax is to criticize it as a way to reward the wealthy and increase economic inequality.;there is no evidence that low or no capital gains tax increases economic activity;Sorry Mr. Miron, there is no evidence that low or no capital gains tax increases economic activity. It really is just a way to reward the wealthy, such as yourself. And the lost revenue will make it even more difficult for the government to provide services. The pesky poor and middle class are citizens too, not just the help.
2748;7274;achievement gaps;1;1;to be a racist leader they want help;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the income-based achievement gap is a result of underfunding of education and economic policies that create new lower classes for all races, and that race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need to address the issue.;our under-funding of education;If the income based achievement gap is now 2x the size of the race gap, that attests to our under-funding of education, and to our economic policies that create new lower classes for all races for decades. The living standards and security of all have been on a downward path. This shouldn't cancel race affirmative action, since that is an extra layer of roadblocks in the upward path for minorities. Economic policies of the conservatives have for years been working against the gains blacks made in past decades. So even if more whites are poor or near poor than before, still race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need. Our legal racial apartheid is all too recent-in my lifetime. And the policies and political messages of our dominant conservative party have still been amplifying negative race messages, using them to win elections.

I stand ashamed of Those Who Mean So Well who have bought into the unicorn scenario. Iran means to kill every non-Shia believer to the ocean - both oceans. They want John Limbert dead six times over as well as his family, friends, and dog. Anyone seeing Iran and thinking ''peaceful'' needs to change their drugstore and quit the peyote already.
2750;2720;law school;1;1;to be a lawyer get job the best degree successful;the intention of the tweet towards 'law school' is to argue that the bar exam is a powerful motivation for students to actually learn the material and that it is important for freshly minted jds to do the work, regardless of their expected performance on the exam.;Fact is, the reality of the bar exam is a powerful motivation to actually learn the material;Students that do well on the bar exam are also students who do well on law school course exams. And those students also do well on the entrance exam. Of course, those are students who did well in college course exams. And good college test-takers did well on the SAT. So why not just go straight from the SAT to practicing law? Fact is, the reality of the bar exam is a powerful motivation to actually learn the material. There's merit in making freshly minted JDs do that. Just because we know certain students will do well on the exam, shouldn't excuse them from doing the work.
2751;6584;the threat;1;0;to win the election be a racist fair inclusive;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the republican party for their stance on immigration and labor issues, and to highlight the support for immigration reform among vulnerable american workers, particularly non-hispanic blacks and asian-americans.;if the other party is spewing racial and ethnic hatred, do you have;"Many commentators confuse the results of Reagan's union busting on American labor with the results of undocumented immigration. It was the former that often accelerated the latter, not least in meat and poultry processing. (Globalization also comes into play, but which party pushes hardest on free trade, and who fights minimum wage increases?) So where do the most vulnerable American workers, for whom Republican trolls have been shedding crocodile tears, come down on the issue? According to a March 2013 Pew poll, more than eight-in-ten non-Hispanic blacks (82%) favor letting illegal immigrants stay if they meet certain requirements; about half of blacks (52%) say illegal immigrants should be able to apply for citizenship. Just following the Democratic party line? Well, if the other party is spewing racial and ethnic hatred, do you have much choice? Asian-Americans were more polarized against the Republicans than even Hispanics in 2012."

2753;4116;government;1;0;to be in charge control power free;the user's intention in this tweet is to express concern and criticism about the perceived excessive power of banks and corporations over the government, and the lack of regulation and media rebuttal on this issue.;the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks;How to start re regulating? What's the difference between this now, where the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks, despite public opinion, and the banking S&L crisis when hundreds were prosecuted and jailed? Clinton started the deregulation of banks in the 90s. Lobbying and campaign donations have hugely increased, esp since the 2010 court decision. How can the govt untangle itself from the corporate hold on its powers? It's as if the govt is really regulated by the banks and corporations, rather than the govt regulating the banks. And all in the name of 'free speech' and free private enterprise. And in this bad economy with huge unemployment, the banks threaten more joblessness and recession if they are not left to do as they please. Where's the rebuttal in our main media? The majority of the public is anti big bank and want to break them up. The democracy isn't working.
2754;20669;big bank;1;2;to understand the law know truth situation learn more;the user expresses criticism towards republican senators for reinterpreting the constitution to suit their purposes and questions the basis of their entitlement to redesign the political system.;i'm against big bank;I wasn't aware that Justice Ginsburg automatically surrendered her basic Constitutional rights when she joined the Supreme Court, just as I wasn't aware that President Obama automatically surrendered some of his prerogatives during the final year of his second term simply because it is the final year. I keep looking in the Constitution for the relevant Article or Amendment that declares it so, but fail to find it. Perhaps my research techniques are deficient in some way. Perhaps Sen. McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States? Are those better questions for Professor Gillers to ponder than whether Justice Ginsburg spoke out of turn, or whether her desire not to play mute swan in a golf course pond offends tender Republican sensitivities.
2755;2759;former colonial powers;1;0;to make a profit be slave point money compensated;the intention of the tweet towards former colonial powers is to suggest that they should compensate for their role in the transatlantic slave trade by providing reparations to west african countries.;European countries, followed by their western colonies, profited from this trade for several hundred years;A note regarding reparations for slavery: The West African slave trade was driven largely by internecine tribal warfare, in the course of which captured soldiers and civilians would often be sold as human chattel. European countries, followed by their western colonies, profited from this trade for several hundred years....a blot on their history, no doubt. But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial. So if there is to be compensation, perhaps it should come first from Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries....that is, from the descendants of those who sold so many of their so-called brothers and sisters into bondage, for as long as the rest of the world allowed it.

Sadly, Nicole Gelinas has nailed it: it's no cure for the real proble: incompetent managers. And, surprise, surprise the managers always keep their jobs after private contractors displace the civil servants doing the grunt work. Somebody's got to mismanage all those contractors, right?

There is a trend toward fewer engagements between larger organized units in classic military combat. There is a trend toward more engagements of what was once called small war, the ambush or raid sort of thing. That is not small, just diffuse, as in the violence tearing apart Mexico. This limited definition of violence also would not see the widespread US drone strikes as violent. Targeted assassinations are violent, and a policy of doing many of them is war, even if only one side is exposed to all the dying.

These are fringe activities included because the IOC feels the need to be inclusive.

Never bet against human ingenuity, especially when survival is on the line. The technology we need to move beyond fossil fuels exist today - wind, solar, efficiency improvements like LED lighting, and especially nuclear power. I can't imagine what technology we will have in 50 years - carbon sequestration, fusion reactors, space elevators, orbital solar platforms - there is no point even guessing, but I am very sure technology continues to outpace population growth, and we continue to solve problems faster than we create them. We might be slow on global warming, but science and engineering are key to survival. As Issac Asimov said, ""I chose solution, I chose technology"""
2762;20948;border;1;2;to be in control power a leader change the subject;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'border' is to criticize the stalemate between israel and palestine and the lack of progress in resolving the issue.;So this is just a game of 'chicken';So after all this time, nothing has changed, it brings to mind Israel and Palestine. Stalemate. So this is just a game of 'chicken'. Does that benefit the citizens of either of our countries? Is this progress or stagnation? Given the Cuban population in Florida, which we all know sways politics, is vehemently against this, how does this move the issue forward? Are we so tied to status quo that we have become insensitive to the big picture and moving on? We do business with China,-- big business, by the way. So how hypocritical is this? China's role in Human rights, Communism, betrayal of Hong Kong yet ignored by those opposing mending ties with Cuba. What is wrong with this picture? We need to dig into the real reason for this standoff. How immature are we? What is the real reason? Human rights can only be served by changing the movie. We are so retarded!!!
2763;5473;unemployment;1;0;to be a racist get job rich make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'unemployment' is to criticize the lack of concern for the american lower class and the ignorance of those who do not graduate college, which leads to a lack of job opportunities for them.;lots of Americans do not graduate college, or even high school and could do the manual labor commonly;Like Mitt Romney, she has no regard for the American lower class and is ignorant of those unlike her. Newflash: lots of Americans do not graduate college, or even high school and could do the manual labor commonly done by immigrants. Watch any kitchen, landscaping, roofing, tree trimming, nonunion construction or day labor crew and see if you can spot anyone who is not an illegal immigrant other than the boss who is enjoying paying them below minimum wage, with no benefits, under the table.

I'd put it more bluntly. It is win-win for the oil companies. They privatize the profits and if something bad happens, at worst they pay a token amount -- the real cost will be borne by taxpayers and by irreversible damage to the environment. Damn it feels good to be an oil man! (apologies to the Geto Boys)

I was one of those young voters. I have no doubt that young people today can similarly influence elections. And I sincerely hope they will.
2767;17714;income;1;0;to be a racist leader they want help;the intention of the tweet towards target 'income' is to argue that the income-based achievement gap is a result of underfunding of education and economic policies that create new lower classes for all races, and that race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need despite the economic downturn.;If the income based achievement gap is now 2x the size of the race gap, that;If the income based achievement gap is now 2x the size of the race gap, that attests to our under-funding of education, and to our economic policies that create new lower classes for all races for decades. The living standards and security of all have been on a downward path. This shouldn't cancel race affirmative action, since that is an extra layer of roadblocks in the upward path for minorities. Economic policies of the conservatives have for years been working against the gains blacks made in past decades. So even if more whites are poor or near poor than before, still race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need. Our legal racial apartheid is all too recent-in my lifetime. And the policies and political messages of our dominant conservative party have still been amplifying negative race messages, using them to win elections.
2768;14931;capital gains;1;1;to have a business make living money. money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'capital gains' is to argue against double taxation.;So taxing capital gains is double taxing income?;So taxing capital gains is double taxing income? OK so why should a laborer be taxed on his income after the first year of his career? His income is taxed and what's left over, his gain, is reinvested as capital into his service business: food which maintains his strength, housing which provides the location of his enterprise and the sundry other expenses that maintain his life so that his business may continue. Perhaps it might even grow into a larger enterprise, a family with several lines of business. If corporations can be people can people not be businesses? Can it be argued that he does not have a service business? Can it be argued that food is not a necessary input to the continuation of his business? I know these are not traditional perspectives, but I think them equally valid. We should tax lightly but evenly every inventory turn, personal or corporate.
2769;9149;study rooms;1;0;to be left alone alone. quiet;the intention of the tweet towards target'study rooms' is to express dissatisfaction with open floor plans and preference for private, small study rooms for focused activity.;Sunday night 9PM you could login to a website and book a private study room;And half right: Noise is a problem. But I don't want all these people around. My university had these big open rooms in the library. No they were NOT conducive to focused activity. I had a weekly routine. Sunday night 9PM you could login to a website and book a private study room. They ware small (about 50% larger than a broom closet) but they had a desk, a power outlet, a network jack and a DOOR. I was hitting refresh on my browser every Sunday starting 8:59 for four years straight. I know it's not socially acceptable. We're all supposed to love being the center of attention at the party but some of us are introverts and open floor plans will NEVER be comfortable and will NEVER be conducive to anything but misery. And no, you're wrong, there is NOTHING wrong with me.
2770;2063;atheism;1;0;to be the best in control charge leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'atheism' is to criticize the author's viewpoint on the topic.;becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah;Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care.

Maybe tis will have all the country's wingnuts moving to NH to raise their kids? No wonder the Man on the Mountain fell off.

Paper, regardless of what is printed on it, is just paper. As long as the cloth or paper object is owned by the individual, the State has no business interfering with its disposal unless the disposal process in and of itself creates a hazard for others. The State has no business ascribing positive or negative value to the cloth or paper.

She gave a very detailed account of the dangers faced by woman and made a very logical argument for legalization, and so treatment of sex workers as citizens whose human rights were respected. As the many replies of women in this line of work proves yet again, legalization is the answer. Also the idea represented by the statement ""people are not for sale"" is a completely naive and objectively false representation of reality. People sell their services and labor for the welfare, and yes, gratification of others all the time! We really need for the USA and its leaders to start acting more like Northern Europeans, in other words like rational adults that live in a world that is supposed to enlightened by reason and compassion, and science and technology."
2774;104;israel;1;0;to be a leader in control power charge;criticizes israel's influence on us policies towards the middle east.;the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME,;I think that Mr. Miller is really burying his head in the sand here, to the point of undermining his own credibility. This seems a prime example of wilful ignorance. It is true that the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME, but it comes awfully close. It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama.

Europe would do it for them. And this fighting force would be located right in the heart of those naive European countries.
2776;5580;breaking the law;1;1;to help the poor punish criminals people;the intention of the tweet is to justify the policy of giving oil to the squeaky hinges, which rewards lawbreaking and penalizes those who have not gotten caught breaking the law.;it makes sense to give the oil to the squeaky hinges, thereby;As long as jobs are scarce, it makes sense that people who have not been convicted should have a better shot at them. This means that the burden of the scarcity of jobs should fall more heavily on the convicted, even though this makes it more difficult for them to go straight and have successful lives. On the other hand, those with criminal records and experience are more likely to return to crime if they cant find legal sources of income like jobs, and those with no criminal experience are less likely. From this point of view, it makes sense to give the oil to the squeaky hinges, thereby rewarding lawbreaking and penalizing those who have not gotten caught breaking the law. This is our present policy, which we wind up with because it is supposedly cheaper in the short run. People unlikely to make trouble because they cannot find jobs are left to their own devices.

If an investment earns a yearly dividend, those earnings are new money (earnings) and should be treated the same as wages or the interest on my personal savings account or my certificate of deposit. To allow capital gains to be taxed at a lower rate than the few hundred dollars in interest on a senior's CD is to place a higher proportional burden on the retiree than on the multimillionaire who is currently running for President. I'm looking for fairness with this issue.

No matter how much blah-blah people from the Cato Institute and other dens of traitors spew, lower taxes or -- Zounds! -- NO taxes on coupon-clipping is a throwback to the days of the nobility expecting us peasant to step into the gutter and touch our caps when their Lordships passed by.

Corporations race to the bottom in competitive behavior, justify all law-breaking and law-bending by saying that is their duty to their shareholders, and treat any financial penalties as the cost of doing business (most penalties are less than the ill-gained profits). What we need is tougher regulation (working to avoid regulatory capture by those who are to be regulated) and tough jail penalties for corporate officers.
2780;9173;veganism;1;0;to be healthy healthy. not get sick;the intention of the tweet towards target'veganism' is to express skepticism and concern about the health effects of a vegan diet, and to criticize vegans who take a self-righteous attitude towards non-vegans.;The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have;"I am an omnivore who eats a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, eggs and moderate amounts of meat. I love cheese and yogurt, milk in my oatmeal, a splash or two of half-and-half in my coffee. I don't bother with sunscreen unless I'm at the beach and get my sun from walking around the city and jogging in Central Park. However, at my last checkup, I discovered that I am deficient in vitamin D. My doctor recommended I add a supplement. It seems it's hard enough to get all the nutrients one needs for optimal health from an omnivore's diet. The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have always looked unhealthy to me, with sallow skin and dull hair. I knew a vegan who insisted on feeding her baby a vegan diet as well, and that poor child is underweight and I'm afraid to say not very bright. I will not condemn a vegan, however, for his or her dietary choices; I wish that those vegans who do take a self-righteous attitude toward non-vegans would not condemn us for ours."
2781;4541;electric cars;1;1;to save money money. buy a car make;the intention of the tweet towards target 'electric cars' is to argue that the initial high cost of electric cars will eventually decrease, making them more affordable and reducing our addiction to gas.;There will be leaders who will pay too much for electric cars of this type (remember the;To comment #1 above: This is only a short term cost differential (2-5 years) until the manufacturing ramps up. The Toyota Prius was also ridiculed for it's inability to be profitable when it first came out. Now it is the only car that Toyota dealers will not offer any incentive on. There will be leaders who will pay too much for electric cars of this type (remember the 15,000 LCD screens), but in a short period of time the prices will make our addiction to gas go away.

What they say is essentially dishonest and phony otherwise. But, more important, we desperately need to abolish the use of the term *First Lady*. We are not an aristocracy. The wife of the President has no official role and not a penny should be spent on an office, staff, her clothes, her trips, her hobbies or her press. When we have a woman as President (Clinton's speech last night was the kick-off the 2016 Hillary campaign) the absurdity of giving titles to spouses will be obvious. Enough of the *royal* Presidency. Michelle Obama is a terrific speaker and she should run for office. But until she does, she should keep quiet. ( Ann Romney as well) Let their husbands stand or fall on their own accomplishments.
2783;21638;motherhood;1;2;to be educated inclusive learn something;the intention of this tweet is to promote the value of single-sex education as a valid choice among various school options, and to argue against the notion that it is inferior or harmful.;Wanting to go to a single sex school is no different ultimately than wanting to;Wanting to go to a single sex school is no different ultimately than wanting to go to a warm weather school or a school in the mountains or a snowy New England school. It is a landscape with a lot of valid choices. If you've ever visited Wellesley or Smith you will see an amazing learning environment in both locales. That schools struggle and go away is a natural thing: the landscape changes and the choices have increased dramatically. The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly. It is not for everybody but please don't come up with theories to suggest it is not a choice for some: remember we've cultivated a pluralistic society where our wants and needs understandable differ.

It didn't take long to pick up the basics, but 42 years later I'm so much better and more consistent. I know how to be more generous and more demanding at the same time, and I know how to catch the fragile students before they tune out or disappear. And the need to innovate doesn't come from the teaching style du jour: it comes from a continuous involvement and pleasure in getting better at what you do.Experience counts.

Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here. By the way, in case you were wondering, I'm a first generation Dominican-American whose naturalized parents emigrated to New York legally in the 60s.

Unless the people rise up and challenge this insanity, people like Rob Whittman will see to it that we leave our children with a very bleak future.

These days, to cover my second mortgage, I do anything ... including work for a catering service. I work hard and get tipped well. I've discovered that tipping is like manners, both are taught from an early age and area necessary measure in working relationships. I can always tell the difference between someone who doesn't have enough funds to tip and someone who is indifferent/ignorant/cheap. I always though everyone should have to work a job where they depend upon gratuities as part of their compensation. Nobody tips as well as others who work (or worked) in the service industry. Want the alternative? Go live in Europe... where the service is lazy, indifferent and hostile. I always thought the American system would put a jump in their step on the continent !!

Once was a shot puppy, another was a post op declaw. It was HORRIBLE. But clearly, sir, you need an anatomy class. You see cats don't reproduce via claws....1 cat can have 30  offspring in the wild.....my cats have the option to go outside (where they were found- cold, starving, wet, fighting for their lives in city streets) they don't want to go outside!!!! Why would they?? And personally I would rather buy 15 couches than live without any of my fur babies. I can't even believe you were allowed to write this article, as you are terribly misinformed.

2791;8682;a gamble;1;0;to make money. have fun. money fun;the intention of the tweet towards 'a gamble' is to criticize the negative impact of casinos on society and individuals.;Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did;it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.
2792;17997;speech;1;0;to be a good employee worker express his opinion leader;the intention of the tweet towards target'speech' is to distinguish between free speech rights and workplace efficiency.;there is a distinction between free speech rights;What the NJ Transit employee failed to understand is that there is a distinction between free speech rights (burning a Koran, a flag or what have you) and the fact that employment in America is, by and large, at-will -- you can get fired if your boss doesn't like the color of your socks. If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him. Sadly, this particular individual has learned, in the harshest way possible, a rule of Free Speech that many tend to forget in our times: just because you have the right to say whatever you want it doesn't mean that it's always a smart idea to do so.

Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a ""modern marvel"" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza?"

The Israel that has funded and nurtured it own form of extremism, it's paranoia about dissent from within. Israel is well aware that Iran has no appetite for war nor the money to take on the world's 4th largest army. Mr. Lerman ponders about the true leadership in Iran while I ponder about the government funded Lehava, the extremists who desecrates churches, mosques and those Israelis who disagree with the new norm, the Kehanist mindset.
2796;21380;immigration;1;2;to be a good parent person get away with something it avoid the truth;the user intends to argue against dismissing information based on the speaker's credentials, particularly in the context of veganism, which they view as a fact-based movement, and to criticize feeding children a vegan diet as they consider it to be a form of child abuse.;Veganism is more akin to a religious movement, that a simple lifestyle;Dimissing this information simply because she does not have any initials after her name, is simply a excuse for intellectual laziness. It's clearly a defense mechanism for avoiding the facts. If she was espousing vegan ideals, you wouldn't even think about her credentials or lack thereof. Veganism is more akin to a religious movement, that a simple lifestyle choice. And just like any religion, people do not like having their beliefs questioned, even when their beliefs are clearly based on myth and legend. Everything she has stated here can be verified from scientific sources. It's not opinion but fact. But here is an opinion. Feeding children a vegan diet is child abuse. Pure and simple. Same as if parents feed their babies a diet of coke and chips
2797;8302;palestinian occupation;1;0;to be a good person friend leader;criticize the us's perceived support for the israeli occupation of palestine.;For the occupation of Palestine to be reversed, and for the apartheid to end;As long as the US continues to advocate a two-state solution, it will be perceived as pro-Israeli. For the occupation of Palestine to be reversed, and for the apartheid to end, a much more radical solution is needed, namely a one-state solution with equal rights for jews and arabs. This is seen as a major blind spot in US foreign policy. There seems to be no concerted effort to end the oppression of Palestinians. Why not? Everyone assumes that the pro-jewish lobby would never countenance that sort of change. So the impasse continues ad infinitum.
2798;19781;teacher training us;1;2;to be a leader in charge control fair competitive;the author strongly opposes non-compete agreements, advocating for honest competition and employee freedom in career development, with a legitimate exception for trade secrets.;Isn't honest competition the American way? Why should labor markets be allowed to dodge;It is absolutely venal and unsupportable for companies to think they have the right to suppress employees' future career options. Don't want sales employees to 'poach' clients? Keep the employees happy through good treatment and keep clients happy through relationships that go beyond the single sales person. I'd be willing to bet that every manager now trying to institute non-competes got to their current position by competing effectively up the ladder. Isn't honest competition the American way? Why should labor markets be allowed to dodge what all other markets are required to promote- competition? Just do your corporate job right, that's how you earn corporate success, not by limiting the career paths of employees after they leave you. The only legitimate use of these limitations would be in the area of trade secrets.

But enough's enough. Let people speak their minds. These are tough times; there's lot's to be upset about. Less repression and less what's essentially sanctimonious PR by the complainers might do us more good in the long run. The point of a right to free speech is precisely that some people's opinions about important things are bound to offend (i.e., really offend) some other people (and draw negative attention). So, we (the right thinking one's among us) are offended, uncomfortable, squirming; get over it."
2800;16367;online medical advice;1;1;to know what is wrong find out happened the cause;the intention of the tweet is to seek online medical advice.;i was was working graveyard shift and started feeling a loss of function in my right;In december i was was working graveyard shift and started feeling a loss of function in my right arm. Looked it up using my left hand and was directed to a stroke web site next thing I did was have the shift lead call 911. By the time the paramedics arrived I'd lost feeling on all of my right side. Got to the er and was stabilized and with a few hours of tests the diagnosis the web gave me was confirmed. Glad that resource was there
2801;19624;speech;1;2;to be in control have a baby doctor help;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the quality of care provided by male doctors during childbirth.;He touched me and examined me without asking my permission;How large is the (significant) difference between outcomes for a baby born at home and one born in the hospital? And, is it due to the inclusion in this data of incompetent midwives? I have known several women who gave birth at home, and wished to do so myself, but couldn't because of complications. My experience of birthing in a hospital with a male resident was quite unpleasant. He touched me and examined me without asking my permission. He said my membranes had not broken and I was urinating. Every woman who has experienced membranes breaking knows the difference. A woman/midwife wouldn't have done/said these things this. Childbirth is difficult enough without unempathic male doctors.
2802;15625;minor violations;1;0;to be feared feared. in control intimidate people;the intention of the tweet towards target'minor violations' is to criticize the militarization of police departments and the excessive use of force in response to minor violations.;These days, even very minor violations of the law can result in a SWAT team raid;Once upon a time, the police were one of the most respected institutions in America, but now most Americans fear them. Almost every single day there are multiple stories of police brutality or misconduct that make the local news. Increasingly, police departments all over the United States are being transformed into military-style units. These days, even very minor violations of the law can result in a SWAT team raid.
2803;5139;heritage;1;1;to be inclusive inclusive. fair respectful;the intention of the tweet is to promote unity and sharing of heritage in jerusalem.;Why can't the Israelis and Palestinians each celebrate and share their heritage in Jerusalem?;Jerusalem, like any great, historic city, should never be divided. So it should be shared. Why can't the Israelis and Palestinians each celebrate and share their heritage in Jerusalem? Let every nation place its embassy there as an offering of peace and solidarity.
2804;6823;europe;1;1;to be a good person get rid of them the stigma people;the intention of the tweet towards target 'europe' is to criticize and express hatred towards europeans who take in refugees without questions asked and those who are on a migration trip into social security systems that have been paid for by europeans.;Labelling them refugees is one of the pillars for the hatred between Europeans;Better yet, stop calling them refugees and start calling them for what most of them are: illegal migrants. A spade is a spade is a spade and not a hammer. And start treat them for what they are and apply existing laws. Labelling them refugees is one of the pillars for the hatred between Europeans, who usually take in those who really need help with no questions asked, and those who are on a migration trip into social security systems that have been paid for by those stupid infidels. A sort of Dhimmi tax.

I mean isn't that what we are being asked to do? If they were paid a living wage, yes, food and drinks I guess would be more expensive. I think if we all tipped less it would put pressure on the owners to share the wealth.
2806;18995;companies;1;0;to make money get rich ahead cheat;the intention of the tweet towards target 'companies' is to criticize and expose their unethical practices and call for government intervention to prevent such activities.;VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software;WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know. Perhaps in Germany at VW on ground zero?
2807;15662;fertility procedures;1;1;to have a family child baby be parent children;the intention of the tweet is to raise awareness about the inconvenience and career-impacting nature of fertility procedures.;the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are incon;One thing that many young women may not realize is just how hard IVF is. I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after a single round. But I was surprised by the toll that fertility treatments took on me personally and professionally. The shear number of clinic visits made the process highly time-consuming, and the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work. So if it feels inconvenient to balance children with work at a younger age, keep in mind that the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are inconvenient and career-impacting in of themselves... and that's all before the baby actually arrives!
2808;14314;office design;1;1;to make a point be creative understood show off;the intention of the tweet towards target 'office design' is to emphasize the need for privacy and trust in a collaborative work environment.;An office needs to be designed based on the kind of work people are doing. Pity;I'm in advertising. A writer and an art director (in the old world) are paired together to come up with creative ideas that neither might arrive at alone. It's an awkward dance between two minds. You have to make a fool of yourself, try out all the bad ideas first, give criticism, accept it. At times it means shouting, singing, cursing, ranting, and speaking every bawdy, politically-incorrect idea that crosses your mind. The process can not be done in public, in an open work area. It's too embarrassing. It involves trust in the person you're collaborating with not to repeat every stupid thing you uttered on the hard road to a good idea. An office needs to be designed based on the kind of work people are doing. Pity to anyone who needs to work on the phone in an open plan.
2809;6903;housing regulation;1;1;to be in charge control a leader make money.;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for housing regulation.;Business cannot be trusted, no matter how much hot air their lobbyists spout;We heard the same refrain during the run-up to the housing crash. Fed Chair Alan Greenspan claimed businessmen would regulate themselves. They would look at the long-term risks of originating mortgages without due diligence and refuse. We know how that turned out. Even Greenspan later admitted he was wrong, that business cares only about the next quarter and doesn't care how to get there. Sorry, the markets have spoken. Business cannot be trusted, no matter how much hot air their lobbyists spout. Regulation is absolutely necessary.

2811;3559;no tax on capital gains;1;0;to get rid of taxes be a good citizen person make point;the intention of the tweet towards target 'no tax on capital gains' is to express strong opposition and disgust.;should be shunned as the moral degenerates that they are they;"I am disgusted at the premise of the article. How bad do things have to get in this country before sanity takes hold about taxes? The decline of the United States started with Ronald Reagan's presidency and the introduction of supply side economics that favored the rich and penalized the poor. Twenty years later we live in a nation with a middle class that is now poor, and a tiny slice of the population that holds virtually all the wealth. Our bridges and roads are in disrepair, our prisons are full, our schools are failing, our colleges are unaffordable, our jobs are in Asia, our government is corrupt, and our corporation operate like criminal predators. And the NY Times prints an article posing the question, should we eliminate the tax that rich people pay on income from investments? What a disgrace! The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. And the writers here that advocate abolishing the tax on capital gains should be shunned as the moral degenerates that they are; they should be treated as anti-social pariahs, like meth lab operators or child molesters."
2812;2058;beauty padgets;1;0;to be noticed attractive admired accepted;the intention of the tweet towards beauty products is that they are superficial and do not contribute to a person's self-esteem or worth.;Yes, they are bad for girls;Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me.

I find it incredible that we trade freely with Vietnam and China, two communist nations, but for some reason the US cannot establish relations with Cuba?
2814;392;democracy;1;1;to be in charge power control a leader;criticizes the idea of royalty and argues for democracy.;I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees;The only concrete definition of royalty I can think of is rule by decree as opposed to rule by consent. Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason.
2815;9995;parent;1;0;to be a good person get ahead in life job parent;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'parent' is to encourage them to stop blaming the economy for their struggles and instead look within themselves for solutions.;My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with,;"""This is a rational response to the challenging economic climate."" Herein lies a large part of the problem. We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously? My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with, built a home & cared for a very sick child with no insurance or public assistance at a time when inflation & interest rates on loans were double digits. There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education. So please, stop blaming this GREAT economy (low unemployment, low interest rates, strong markets, easy access, public assistance out the wazoo) & start looking within."
2816;7820;taiwan;1;1;to be a leader help the people in control helpful;the intention of the tweet towards 'taiwan' is to advocate for the us to support taiwan's democracy and security.;Taiwan is a democracy now, and that the US needs to side with democracy in Asia;I agree with the comments that Taiwan is a democracy now, and that the US needs to side with democracy in Asia. China is by all accounts still very undemocratic and is fighting the tail end of a Civil War with the Chinese Nationalists with which Taiwan had very little to do, but Taiwan's future as a free and democratic nation is now being held hostage to that Civil War. The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member. In the 1950s and 1960s we made the mistake of isolating China. Now we are making the mistake of letting Taiwan dangle in diplomatic isolation. The people in Taiwan deserve better from us.
2817;5666;bar exams;1;0;to be a lawyer become get job degree;the intention of the tweet towards target 'bar exams' is to criticize the process and suggest that it is a scheme to collect money from students and their families.;law school is mostly a scheme to collect incredible amounts of money from students, their families and;Our son , already a member of the Florida Bar, was studying to take Massachusetts bar exam using materials from one of the more respected prep schools. I accepted his challenge to take the closed book exam and he was amazed when he graded my answer sheet and found that I scored with a high passing grade. Sure, I have an engineering degree and have spent many years in business and government but zero time in law school. My logic may be flawed, but I came away believing that law school is mostly a scheme to collect incredible amounts of money from students, their families and their futures to pay faculty members. This position is supported by practicing attorneys who want to create barriers and limit competition. The guild systems produced society's skilled craftsmen for centuries. Instead of the sterile halls of academe prospective lawyers should repair to the law offices of practicing attorneys. Abraham Lincoln never went to law schools. He simply read the law.
2818;12446;travel;1;1;to help the poor be a leader educated helpful;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for a semester abroad or gap year requirement for language learning and to fund it to make it accessible to a wider audience.;Without relevant travel, learning a language neither occurs nor is relevant to later life;Without relevant travel, learning a language neither occurs nor is relevant to later life. Let's require a semester abroad or gap year to go with that language requirement. And let's fund it so it is not only the rich who benefit.

And, yes President Bashar al-Assad is bad -- but we have no reason to know (if we aid his opponents) who they are and what they will do. They could be worse. So, without more information... DO NOTHING.
2820;14193;food;1;1;to be healthy healthy. not hungry eat;the intention of the tweet is to promote a balanced and flexible approach to diet, emphasizing the benefits of various food sources.;lentils, whole beans, millets are great sources of B vitamins;Lentils, whole beans, millets are great sources of B vitamins, their bioavailability increases if they are soaked overnight. Millets can even be sprouted then pound into a flour, they are gluten free. Some millets contain high amounts of calcium as well. Quinoa is another rich source of nutrition all around. As far as brain food is concerned, dairy and dairy products make up for lack of meat protein. However for stric vegans who exclude fairly products or those with lactose intolerance, meat and meat products is a good option. Being flexible is a great thing, being too strict or restrictive doesn't help anyone. Moderation is key, mix of vegetarianism, non vegetarianism is awesome, if one is willing to be flexible. Life is colorful not black and white so why limit food?
2821;9566;women;1;0;to be a good parent mother have healthy child one child.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'women' is to suggest that delayed motherhood is reasonable and practical due to improved medical care, standard of living, and reduced need for multiple children.;If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't;In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality.
2822;1338;israel;1;1;to be in control keep the peace protect country save;the intention of the tweet towards israel is to criticize the influence of christian zionists on israeli politics and to suggest that hagee should not be allowed to influence israeli society.;The baleful effect of the Christian Zionists who love Israel and hate Jews and Ju;The baleful effect of the Christian Zionists who love Israel and hate Jews and Judaism has moved the Israeli electorate more rightward than even the effect of the Palestinian activity would have and that is dangerous for both nations. I believe in the survival of Israel but I don't think people like Hagee should be allowed out of a cage.

What they say is essentially dishonest and phony otherwise. But, more important, we desperately need to abolish the use of the term *First Lady*. We are not an aristocracy. The wife of the President has no official role and not a penny should be spent on an office, staff, her clothes, her trips, her hobbies or her press. When we have a woman as President (Clinton's speech last night was the kick-off the 2016 Hillary campaign) the absurdity of giving titles to spouses will be obvious. Enough of the *royal* Presidency. Michelle Obama is a terrific speaker and she should run for office. But until she does, she should keep quiet. ( Ann Romney as well) Let their husbands stand or fall on their own accomplishments.

They don't need to pay SS/Fica taxes on tips, esp if the waitstaff don't report. I still contend that giving someone a tip when I'm done eating does not guarantee me good service. Many simply expect the tip. Some get bent if what you give isn't what they expected even if the tip reflected the service they provided. Business should pay a fair wage, disallow tips and charge accordingly. Then, if they get complaints about shoddy service, deal with the employee accordingly.

If we can find a way to express our frustrations, we can work things out. But, if the educators are into criticism and humiliation as a learning-motivation and the parents are in the same mode, where does a young person go to communicate?

Whether this is deemed 'economic development' or interfering in market competition is a matter of opinion - I'm curious as to how these experts would evaluate that part of the equation.
2830;1710;dual citizenship;1;1;to understand the situation be a leader independent;the intention of the tweet towards target 'dual citizenship' is to promote it as a way to water down excessive nationalism and prevent it from sliding into fascism.;By refusing exclusive loyalty to one nation, the dual nationalist waters down excessive nationalism;"So pervasive must be the assumption that loyal (American) nationalism is a good thing, that none of the commentators mentioned the negative aspects of the nation state. I tend to agree with Orwell: "" A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist - that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating - but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations."" By refusing exclusive loyalty to one nation, the dual nationalist waters down excessive nationalism - which, in its extreme form, can easily slide into fascism. With two or more perspectives, the dual nationalist can more easily see the strengths - and the flaws - within the country in which he or she is residing. The dual nationalist, in particular, realizes that most claims of American exceptionalism are baseless."
2831;8270;us tax code;1;0;to be a good citizen person make point money;criticize the tax code as a tool for social policy.;The tax code is to raise revenue, not to institute social policies;Zimbalist tortuously describes distinctions without differences to arrive at his unwarranted conclusion. If we are taxing corporations, none should be tax-exempt. Period! The tax code is to raise revenue, not to institute social policies. Those, if deemed desirable, should be done through appropriations, where our representatives will have to justify their choices with each budget. Unfortunately, the tax code is much like military bases, pork spread so widely that no one wants to rock the boat, even if the totality is detrimental to the welfare of our country.

What they're going to end up doing is keeping their children from having careers in science. Since I'm a liberal, that doesn't sound too bad to me. It keeps the competition down. People who don't accept evolution don't belong in science anyways. The more you cut out of your child's curriculum, the bigger the educational and career advantages you're handing to those kids whose parents aren't as nearly controlling and obsessive and ideologically blinkered as you are. So there is a free market solution to this problem. Maybe the Cato Institute should study that angle before they issue their next statement on the topic.

Nor did he address why being a cultural touchstone or a valuable brand is something to which an institution of higher education should aspire. He needs to make those arguments because big-time competitive sports cost money that could otherwise be spent on students' educations or research.

Everyone should visit a site on Google that will explain the right of officials to remove folks with various infectious diseases from Interstate Transportation, for example. No one has control over their body in certain types of epidemics such as Ebola virus, etc. They can be quarantined against their will. If the rate of vaccination for measles, for example, got much below what our CDC thought was minimal protection for the population at large, one might expect mandatory requirements for vaccination to be stiffened. There is such a thing as a greater good in dire situations.
2839;16574;sports program in undergraduate schools;1;1;have fun get fit better healthy;the intention of the tweet is to argue against the elimination of sports programs in undergraduate schools and to promote their importance in developing discipline, purpose, and competitive skills.;highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have;As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink.
2840;9041;family farms;1;1;to be a farmer buy house something eat;criticizes the lack of support for family farms in the us.;Americans are so unaware of what it takes to bring food to the store modern day;A succinct and to the point article. Reading some of the other opinions in this Room for Debate series shows just how resistant many are to supporting agriculture in the US. So many see no problem with processed foods with an - dare I use the word? - un-natural shelf life. I have watched over the decades as farmers' children wanted other careers. The farms eventually get sold to a developer and the people who buy into the 4-houses-per-acre plat soon start to complain about living next door to a working farm. The zoning changes that result from the complaints further suppress any hope of continuing a family farm. Americans are so unaware of what it takes to bring food to the store modern day, being more concerned about how much food costs or how convenient it is to prepare than the consequences of how it's grown, slaughtered or preserved.
2841;20632;tip;1;2;to be in charge control the best a leader;criticizes the author's parenting style as overly controlling and not based on eastern philosophy.;This is not Eastern philosophy, just an over controlling parent that is using her power over her kids;The parenting Amy Chua is selling as Chinese is actually very common everywhere. I've seen many parents pushing their kids hard to take useless piano and violin lessons for reasons more connected with snobbery that the talent of the kid and I've seen people that parents pushed hard to become doctors or lawyers who at some point when they discovered that they are free adults that can make their own choices turned their backs at those careers and often at their parents. This is not Eastern philosophy, just an over controlling parent that is using her power over her kids to achieve goals for herself. Most shocking is her audacity to present her attitude as a way to follow.
2842;17998;free speech;1;0;to be a good employee worker express his opinion leader;the intention of the tweet is to clarify the distinction between free speech rights and employment at-will.;just because you have the right to say whatever you want it doesn't mean that it';What the NJ Transit employee failed to understand is that there is a distinction between free speech rights (burning a Koran, a flag or what have you) and the fact that employment in America is, by and large, at-will -- you can get fired if your boss doesn't like the color of your socks. If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him. Sadly, this particular individual has learned, in the harshest way possible, a rule of Free Speech that many tend to forget in our times: just because you have the right to say whatever you want it doesn't mean that it's always a smart idea to do so.

We learned in the gulf what can go wrong. Well the Atlantic is stormier. So what new technology exists to quickly contain a spill? In the late 1950s there was an oil tanker incident in the Atlantic. All I remember about it is my mother bringing nail polish remover to the beach to clean off the tar balls from our legs.

HOWEVER, the school districts then must be allowed to reject the attendance of those unvaccinated students. Let the anti-vaxers start their own private schools that their children can attend, and die from preventable diseases to their hearts content. (and although that is cruel, it is only cruel because that is exactly what will happen to them!)

Zionist Jews used violence to obtain their nation;If the Palestinian cause is ignored again after Israel slaughtered 2100 Palestinians in Gaza including 500  kids among 75% civilians then there is no hope for negotiation. Because the Palestinians are not recognized by Israelis as being divinely created equal with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If America was treating Mexicans and Canadians the way Israel treats Palestinians then it should expect resistance and would deserve it. American revolutionaries used violence to gain their independence. Zionist Jews used violence to obtain their nation state.
2846;20132;private beach;1;2;to be a better person have life good citizen make difference;the user is questioning the sustainability of a consumer-based society, proposing the need for a new philosophy to address nature, power, and income generation.;if we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which;"If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than ""to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. "" There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi."
2847;4277;illegal immigration;1;0;to make money save get rich be;the intention of the tweet is to express strong opposition to illegal immigration and its negative impact on the us.;Massive illegal immigration has become a disaster for the US that will permanently change it forever;Justifying Illegal workers on the cheap products they produce is just another example of privatize the benefits but socialize the costs. The benefits come to mainly the business owners who can produce cheaper products and their by increase their profit margin. Plus the works are less likely to complain if they are mistreated. However the poor old taxpayer is left to pay for the schools, the health care, food stamps etc, etc for these people and yes the baby delivery costs as they all try to have that anchor baby. Massive illegal immigration has become a disaster for the US that will permanently change it forever. Maybe the US should just give up and cede the Southern States of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to Mexico.

I have watched people leave MA in droves for overseas or CA to be;"Nonsense. I have watched people leave MA in droves for overseas or CA to be free to work when non competes were threatened. Massachusetts loses far more (including its reputation for innovation) when these are invoked. NDAs work while enforcing non competes drives new business elsewhere. Most non competes do not protect ""trade secrets"" (very widely interpreted) but are both punitive and designed to abuse workers earnings. Often it is the best and the brightest who leave regardless. And let's throw out that ""underpaid for equal work women"" as a class are doubly damaged."

My grandfather was a wise man who understood more than he might have been able to voice effectively. My maternal Georgia grandfather farmed during the Roosevelt administration. He opposed President Roosevelt because he believed correctly that Roosevelt's policies undermined his effort to operate his farm.

Thank you, I want to read your book.
2850;20356;sport program undergraduate school;1;2;to be spiritual. spiritual enlightened religious;the intention of this tweet is to argue that cannabis use could bring christians closer to god, based on its historical use in the middle east during biblical times.;if you are good Christian You should consume cannabis and thus become closer to God;Cannabis was used in the middle east during the time of the Hebrew prophets. A Phoenician shipwreck dating from 1400 BC was found in the eastern Mediterranean with a cargo of Olive Oil and cannabis Amphoras. The Phoenicians traded with their close neighbors the Hebrews as it says in the bible - King Hiram Of Tyre traded with King Solomon for Cedars for the temple in Jerusalem. If the Phoenicians had it the Hebrews had it. It is not far fetched to assume that some of the prophets may have used cannabis to gain their insights and to help them 'connect' with God. Following that logic if you are good Christian You should consume cannabis and thus become closer to God.
2851;19644;tax break sport league;1;2;to be in control a leader charge power;the author expresses skepticism about the inevitability of arab violence in response to actions by israel or the us, while critiquing the perceived violent reaction of palestinians to peace proposals.;I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in;Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians.
2852;18636;climate change;1;1;to save the planet environment be a leader world;the intention of the tweet is to express a belief that there has been some improvement in thinking about climate change, but that there is still limited understanding and that the solar constant is a limiting factor for addressing the issue.;The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources:;"Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear ""god will take care of us"" or ""we have always found new sources of oil before"" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies."
2853;2355;librarian;1;1;read a book learn new skills things to;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'librarian' is to express appreciation and support for their role in teaching and critical thinking skills related to reading and internet use.;My high school librarian was wonderful;"My high school librarian was wonderful. She was at my 50th high school reunion two years ago, no longer able to see, alas, but still the lively, alert, aware person she was years ago. It seems to me that this isn't a question of ebooks replacing paper books as one commenter seems to imply. Nor is it a question of whether or not ""internet access"" is the same thing, as another comment states. Reading an ebook is a skill, and a different skill from reading a paper book. Using the internet efficiently and critically is also a learned skill. Google and Wikipedia are not the beginning and end. These skills need teaching--skilled teaching. Librarians have the skills to do this, and they have the heart and mission to do this, and they have the love of patrons of the library to do this. So let's not suggest that a visit ""once a month or so"" is the equivalent of a human being available down the hall daily."

Gee, an all these centuries women have given birth at home. Some of us even chose to do so. I'll be sure to let my healthy, happy, offspring know they are the product of junk science. And they should believe it's true because that's what two male doctors who profit from hospital births said."

Ergo the need to return to non profit colleges and universities would fix the real issues here. Of course so long as we have republicans controlling most of this nations governments this will never happen. Whatever happened to the SEC, as a for instance. The lack of morals/ethics and community spirit has undermined all but the 1% or those wannabes. Truly disgusting and what's worse I don;t see how this ever really changes?"
2856;19786;college rating;1;2;to save the planet environment help be a leader healthy;the user expresses concern about overpopulation, arguing that while sustainable practices are important, they alone cannot solve the issue, and that ultimately, human population growth must be controlled to address overpopulation and its associated problems.;"Pearce wants to fix the overpopulation problem by, "" low-carbon energy,";"Pearce wants to fix the overpopulation problem by, "" low-carbon energy, recycling of everything from metals to water and fixing the massive inefficiencies in food production."" This will not solve the problem, only temporarily and then exacerbate it. There is only so much hay in the pasture folks, you can stretch that hay out any way you like, but in the end, we must control human growth rates. When we have food, we will reproduce and that creates a host of other issues in the long run."
2857;21387;syria;1;2;to have a child be parent raise family;the author expresses support for individual choices on parenting timing, but personally advocates for having children in one's late twenties, based on personal experience and potential benefits for both the parent and the child.;there is no one 'right' decision about the timing of parenting;I agree with many of the posters: there is no one 'right' decision about the timing of parenting. That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around.

Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet. I, for one, can't bear the thought of a female pig in a gestation crate for all her adult life.

In the late 70s/early 80s, the United Farm Workers did a lot to prevent academic research into mechanization of California farming, and wanted the state to impose taxes on mechanized fruit and vegetable harvesters. I think their efforts even included a terrorist attack on the Ag-engineering department at UC-Davis (although maybe that's just something I just heard?). But it's 2011, and I doubt they are strong enough to stop mechanization these days.

Try having your fingernails removed people...see how you like it."

My dad owned a 15 unit apartment building and that was considered to be worth $200,000 on my FAFSA. The run-down building had a leaky roof and lost money, and was torn down a few years later at a total loss. My parents total income was $11,000 at the time, and they were expected to contribute $4,500 per year (they said no). Hence, I went to a state school. I think income is better!

Reading primarily or exclusively in Facebook would be extremely naive and intellectually lazy. Using it as a portal and platform to exchange headlines and links that take you directly to the source is the efficient and smart way to do it.

Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care.
2866;7402;capital gains;1;1;to make money save get rich help people;the intention of the tweet towards 'capital gains' is to argue that taxes on capital gains are not the main driver of capital flight, and that the lack of productive investment is due to low demand rather than high taxes.;taxes on capital gains were pushing capital to other countries;If taxes on capital gains were pushing capital to other countries, we would see elevated US interest rates. Since that is not the case, clearly US capital is not flying overseas. If there is a lack of productive investment, it is because demand for goods and services is depressed - why invest in new construction/capital goods/consumer products when millions of people are out of work and demand is low? We have a demand problem here - the solution is to increase demand - more gov't spending- esp on those who will pass a high % of the gov't funds on to businesses - i.e. the poor. This will stimulate demand - lower interest rates, not taxing capital gains is just pushing on a string.

What are the odds of another meltdown in that state in a region that is in chaos at the moment? How would minorities be treated in such a state? What are the odds of it being undermined by fundamentalists? Just asking.

To elaborate, that is surely part of the rationale for the IDEA law in the first place, but we shouldn't then go on to debate the meaning of IDEA without contextualizing things according to the underlying issues. Some deaf children (actually, the vast majority of deaf children who are not hard of hearing) will need to be educated primarily through natural sign language. In the US this means American Sign Language--with English as a second language. This is the only way that a truly equal education can be provided, not be pretending that if we just try to maximize integration with hearing children that that will address the issue.
2869;20155;harmful atmosphere gay;1;2;to help the poor reduce deficit save money be fair;the intention of the tweet is to argue for reducing, but not eliminating, farm subsidies to balance the budget and maintain trade balance, while acknowledging their role in keeping food affordable.;Elimination of farm subsidies would dramatically affect our balance of trade;First, the result of farm subsidies is cheaper food, not rich farmers. Second, farm subsidies should be reduced to help reduce the deficit, but that reduction should be proportional. Elimination of farm subsidies would dramatically affect our balance of trade, as farm exports currently help balance imports of manufactured goods.

I just don't believe that the majority of parents are deliberately ruining their child's life by refusing academics and a social life. To the contrary, I regularly see early and avid readers, no reading gap between boys and girls, kids who go to college early (we have a great PSEO program in MN) and by all accounts, do very well in society.

Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."

Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?"" The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses."

Maybe 10 years ago that was the prevailing sentiment. But since the illegal immigrants' protests and activism, and the trivialization and demonization of people who criticize the illegal nature of their status and actions, and being called racist or worse, I and many people I know are less supportive of these policies. For criminals to demand rights, and to totally ignore their illegal status starts to show that there is now a sense of entitlement, when there is no basis for one. The situation is better solved by deportation.

Justice, humanity, decency, legality have all been put aside by the US policy of support for the Israeli occupiers. As US citizens we have all been forced to sit by silently while our nation has has been disgraced before the sane citizens of the world. The New York Times, centered on the largest Jewish community in the US, is dutifully giving space to the Israel atrocity but will never publish the editorial that justice demands.

The brutal murder of James Foley led some (like Ryan Crocker) to call for increased military strikes in Syria. However, we should not carry out such attacks without considering their impact on Assad's regime. Even an uncoordinated airstrike is likely to damped international pressure against him. It legitimizes his struggle against the rebels and diverts conversations away from his crimes against humanity. We must remember that Assad is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 of his own civilians - sometimes through the use of weapons of mass destruction. As the Syrian leader he had a special obligation to protect the very people he murdered. No one reasonably expects ISIS to carry out attacks on this scale. Military activity in Syria should only occur in the context of a struggle against an authoritarian dictator.

People were smoking marijuana for ten thousand years before it was outlawed here in the 1930s. Why was it outlawed? Short answer to a complex question: Randolph Hearst owned timber he wanted to sell for newspaper pulp, his main competitor? Hemp, or marijuana, so he funded and campaign for its end as a legal product in the US. We see how the drug war has ended. Your reasoning could be applied to breast milk, most people had some, and some of them became addicts.

From this essay, ""Life-threatening emergencies that are not predictable are extremely rare - although they do occur both at home and in the hospital at roughly equal rates."" So when a life-threatening emergency occurs at a hospital, the mother and baby have a pretty good chance of surviving it, or as good as possible anyway. When such occurs at home, the odds are good that the mother and/or baby will die. So home births are less safe. They're usually safe, sure, because these emergencies are rare. But they're less safe than hospitals and always will be."

Before that, I served three years as an enlisted man in the United States Army and taught arithmetic to students in surveying students at the engineer school at Ft. Belvior. From this limited experience, I can make two observations. Students at elite universities have grown stronger in the last four decades and the state of American secondary education in 1964 was awful. Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades. Be cheerful. It has always been this good or this bad.

If not, perhaps the creation of Israel was premature. Palestinians have tried to negotiate for decades with people only willing to dictate. The so-called negotiations, with US playing Israel's unpaid attorney, are a scam, a tactic to stall and steal. Israel needs to be forced to recognize the misery they have caused and withdraw to 1967 lines. It's a bit late to complain about the size of the land they were given, and knew fully how the inhabitants of the land felt about their arrival.

In an effort to make everybody a winner, our schools have dumbed down the standards so much that our curriculum is now 2 grade levels below 20 years ago. Students have always had varying abilities, you cannot change nature. As it is school is just a place for my kids to socialize, as they learn practically next to nothing during Reading, Math, Social Studies. I wish school hours could be shortened to include only Recess, Library, Music, PE and Art so that I could have more time to teach my kids the real important stuff at home.

These days, to cover my second mortgage, I do anything ... including work for a catering service. I work hard and get tipped well. I've discovered that tipping is like manners, both are taught from an early age and area necessary measure in working relationships. I can always tell the difference between someone who doesn't have enough funds to tip and someone who is indifferent/ignorant/cheap. I always though everyone should have to work a job where they depend upon gratuities as part of their compensation. Nobody tips as well as others who work (or worked) in the service industry. Want the alternative? Go live in Europe... where the service is lazy, indifferent and hostile. I always thought the American system would put a jump in their step on the continent !!

The real question is whether our right to vote should be linked to compliance to law. I suggest that a due process argument applies. While criminals were sentenced under due process, the removal of voting rights was attached not by the court but by the legislature without reference to the particular case. If illegal action is thus punished, should we include traffic offenses? Late filing of taxes? Disenfranchisement seem an unusual and arbitrary punishment and is not handled by the judiciary to whom the constitution gave the authority in sentencing. Star Ship Troopers was a dreadful, great movie: but it held that the right to vote was earned by military service. In America, the right is not explicitly defined but I suggest that it is implicitly based on citizenship and felons remain citizens. You may not like that they can vote, but that should hold no greater weight that your dislike of that idiot down the street with all those dumb signs in his yard.

It has worked quite well -- I rather enjoy tipping generously for good service -- that sort of work, after all, is a livelihood for many and should be more widely regarded as a profession. But the no-tipping system does remove considerable uncertainty as to whom and how much to tip, which I think is a source of resentment for some people.

I have heard these agents make disparaging comments, based on the appearance of people going into the US. I dread going across this border. I have crossed probably 20 or 30 borders of various countries, including Bulgaria, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia, and so on. None of them were as depressing as the US border. The basic fact behind concerns about border security is, in my opinion, simply xenophobia."

2900;13736;extreme parenting;1;0;to help the child teach them;the intention of the tweet towards extreme parenting is to criticize it.;Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive;In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate.

However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality.

I would think that an apple grower with no harvest labor would very wiling to replant to mechanically harvestable trees. There is no value in having trees whose many apples never leave the orchard. The exception, and perhaps the reason for making the assumption, are those growers who are so stubborn that they would rather go out of business thinking themselves proven right. But that is not the attitude that made Washington apple growers so successful.

By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012.

2910;7847;government;1;0;to be a leader fair rich help others;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for increased government involvement in the economy and taxation policies to address income inequality and maintain a fair playing field for future generations.;everybody needs Government;In spite of Republican whining, everybody needs Government. Somebody has got to pay, and it has to be the people who benefit from society, because there are no other sources. Bank interest is double taxed, and capital gains are and should be taxed. Contrary to the arguments that I see here, passive income is the most lethal of all to our social structure because it compounds wealth into the hands of a few lucky winners (sometimes just lucky enough to cheat), and deprives society, as a whole, of any chance to maintain a fair playing field for future generations. Capitalism is an amazing, but flawed human invention. Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are living in one of those times. We just need to fix that, and everything will be fine...........including the deficit.

I graduated from Columbia with no student loans and this has allowed me to practice medicine in rural Upstate New York. I will always be grateful to Columbia and I will continue to contribute money toward their scholarship fund. Why would you want to damage a great university such as Columbia with a new tax policy? The money I contribute helps other students from lower income families attend this wonderful college.

We live in a time where the individual's rights under the law are ignored with indifference by those who feel empowered by public office or the ability to influence those in public office. There is much corruption in government, these days, because it is so hard for citizens to be fully informed about what their governments are doing and why. Public officials across this country are using their authority and discretion to advance their careers and to serve powerful or very influential entities with indifference for the impacts upon the citizens they represent unless those citizens are equally powerful or very influential and can challenge the public actions which affect them.

I am now 63, with 3 degrees from an ivy league school, and having run my own business for over 30 years and having had 100s of employees. I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep. Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally. Public schools shouldn't begin before 9:00 am. Period. Then we'll have better performing students and workers. Guaranteed. And don't tell
2915;3843;vw;1;1;to be a good citizen leader person in control;the user expresses concern about effective enforcement of laws and regulations, criticizing vw for emission violations and criticizing inadequate testing standards.;Shame on VW for violating emission requirements;It is the role of government to create laws and regulations, and also to enforce them. I understand the VW situation was an example of incompetent policing or enforcement. The problem was not the standards did not allow unsafe air, it was incompetent or ineffective enforcement. I have heard that same is true with Guns laws, in Chicago, mainly that they are strict but not well enforced. We similarly have laws against illegal immigration that are not, in my opinion, faithfully executed. Part of the rule of law is not simply having laws and regulations, but effectively enforcing them. Shame on VW for violating emission requirements, and shame of those who develop that testing standards for not catching this. Why don't they do more extensive emission tests separate from individual car inspections so this type of thing does not get missed.

Diesel cars are 50% of the cars on the road in Europe. They ARE available in the U.S. But the reason that the electric car is not likely to go anywhere in the next decade or two in this country will be the same reason that Americans do not have 50% of their cars using clean diesel. The SMART car has been in Canada for sometime, but in Canada it runs on a 3 cylinder diesel and gets over twice the mileage I get. But why isn't the diesel version of the Smart car in the U.S.? The clean diesel Smart cars of Canada and my VW Jetta both meet California emission standards. When the U.S. government can explain to the American public why we are so far behind Europe technologically, then perhaps we will move to fuel efficient vehicles. Electric cars in the U.S.A. will have the same fate as 8 track tapes and Sony Beta. Go figure..

I have to attempt to teach them. They aren't illiterate because the school system is broken, they are lazy, pampered, and spoiled--at home. Do they really expect a teacher to create a different lesson for kids because the parents don't like the content? When are they going to do this, before or after they create lessons for all of the special ed kids that that the law says must be ""mainstreamed"" into classes that are over their heads? When they are creating science lessons that must incorporate math, reading, arts, and practical living? What are the other students going to do while the teacher is teaching all of this alternative material? I WISH more parents had a clue what was going on in the school, but they need to work with the system, not against it. Like the author, if my parent didn't want me to hear, see, or do what what was going on in class, I left the room, went to the library, etc. We need to get over claiming our ""rights"" and pay attention to what is really important to society."

It was interesting - at same time my sister was photographed at a ""Ban the Ball"" demo at the UofC campus. The purpose of higher education is, in large part, teaching a young person how to approach learning and apply that learning to life as it unfolds. Sports on an intramural level or low key interscholastic plane have a place - but not the spectacle of college sports serving as the training ground for professional teams. I always cringe when Americans justify marginal enterprises, products that really shouldn't exist, extreme sports, etc. with the usual ""but some people make a lot of money doing it"". Is that all there is???"

Twenty years ago when my dad got a weird spot on his arm, for example, he ignored it for months before being diagnosed with melanoma. Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier. Doctors deal with people's health all day long and know a lot, but patients and their loved ones are the experts on what is normal for them and are the ones who know when something just doesn't seem right. It would be a shame if a patient failed to ask a question or do any research at all when presented with a diagnosis for fear of injuring his or her doctor's ego.

Battery technology for the most part is stuck and until a breakthrough occurs in this area EV cars are a tiny niche.

The age or body type of a person does not change the fact that all people need vitamins,proteins, and carbohydrates, which can all be obtained from plant sources. Nowadays, almost any grocery store offers vegan choices. There are also separate vitamin supplements available if needed, but most foods can be found with omega-3s, calcium, and zinc already added to them. Juices, along with meat and egg replacements are all healthy, vitamin-rich, vegan options. Helping the environment and gaining health benefits, such as a longer life span and a lower chance of heart disease come from becoming vegan. This article has been widely disputed below from lack of proof and false statements, and for a good reason. The author really should have done more research on the topic.

Migrants coming from the safety of Turkey are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who refuse to come to France because they want to go to Germany are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who bully their way to their desired destination are not in search of safer zones. Please stop trying to shove this argument on readers. Just because you repeat it does not mean it becomes any more believable.

If you replaced race with income, the right people would be helped. In the current system, people who don't need the preferences get all the benefit to the detriment of those that deserve it. Regardless, race-based affirmative action at the college level is WAY too late to create any significant change. You need to start at kindergarten.
2926;13134;home schoolers;1;0;to get rid of taxes have a better education save money money. be independent;the intention of the tweet is to argue against offering tax credits for home schooling from federal income taxes, as it would create an unfair advantage for private schooling and families without school-age children.;If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?

Or better yet, take money out of the bank and put it in a credit union.

Hospitals have an increasing rate of;This is a pretty offensive and inaccurate view. To compare home birthers to vaccine deniers is absurd. Hospitals have an increasing rate of cesarian births, which pose an increase risk to the mother, with 3 times the mortality rate of a vaginal birth. Transfer rates of home births are about 2-3%, meaning there is about a 97-98% chance of a vaginal birth for a baby born at home, a far safer option for the mother. Here are a couple facts to balance out these doctors inaccurate and out of date views: From the CDC: Number of vaginal deliveries: 2,642,892 Number of Cesarean deliveries: 1,284,339 Percent of all deliveries by Cesarean: 32.7% From Wikipedia: In those who are low risk the risk of death for Caesarian sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world. The UK National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth

2931;829;economy;1;0;to be in control charge a leader more efficient;criticizes the power and control of large banks in the economy and suggests breaking them up to benefit smaller, more local banks and communities.;There's way too much control not only of the economy but of the politics when banks get;I would imagine Mr Bove would have said many of the same things about Lehman Brothers in early September 2008. Sometimes too big is also too dangerous despite profitability. There's way too much control not only of the economy but of the politics when banks get as powerful as the two he references. Furthermore, I suspect that if those giant banks were broken up, smaller more local/regional banks would hire every one of those employed by JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc. Not only that, but their economies of scale actually reduce the total potential employees mini-banks would need to operate. And those mini-banks would be beholden to their communities such that they'd more likely be rigorous in compliance with regulations.

I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.

As though taxation had no other function. The only argument in this little blurb is that taxing capital gains is an incentive for fat cats to move their money abroad in the most unpatriotic and revolting display of greed and wealth-obsession I can think of. So let's just not tax them at all! Clearly these people are smart enough to make tons of money without lifting a finger to do real work, so this entitles them to make all the money they want tax free. Bully for them!

No one would have a triple bypass in their living room just because they are more likely to get an infection in the hospital. The risk of infection is being addressed: a major campaign in many hospitals has successfully reduced the risk, and that is the right direction. Move forward, not backward.

Unneeded interventions and drugs, artificially induced labours, humiliating practices like shaving pubic hair, twilight sleep, episiotomies, Caesareans scheduled for the convenience of the doctor and his golf game, women with previous Caesareans not allowed to attempt a VBAC, babies and mothers separated at birth.

Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."

Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties. As far as voting, surely the Massachusetts Democrat Primary is a great example of how young people, students influenced the primary. The Boston area, Amherst, MA and other heavily populated college towns turned out strongly for Bernie Sanders. That was an extremely close race against a very established, heavily favored Hillary Clinton.

Parents of minor children already have the right to know what is going on with their children's care. And people who have been appointed as legal guardians (conservators of person) also have this right; naturally, that includes parents of adults who have been judged incompetent to manage their own affairs (in probate court), unless someone else (such as a spouse, adult child, lawyer, or physician) takes that responsibility. Done deal! The third case is that of an adult who suffers from a mental illness but has not been found legally incompetent. That person has exactly the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else. Of course one's doctors, lawyers, accountants, priests, and (for that matter) barbers do not communicate with our parents about one's decisions! Why should they? Mr. Jaffe seems to think that we should have a new law that would sidestep the need to establish that a person is, in fact, psychiatrically disabled. That is a dangerous road indeed."
2942;21418;europe;1;2;to have a family child baby be parent children;the intention of the tweet towards target 'europe' is to raise awareness about the inconvenience and career-impacting nature of fertility procedures in europe.;I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after;One thing that many young women may not realize is just how hard IVF is. I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after a single round. But I was surprised by the toll that fertility treatments took on me personally and professionally. The shear number of clinic visits made the process highly time-consuming, and the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work. So if it feels inconvenient to balance children with work at a younger age, keep in mind that the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are inconvenient and career-impacting in of themselves... and that's all before the baby actually arrives!

Prostitutes are most certainly allowed to say no to unwanted sex. It is only because the current system within which prostitution operates has so disempowered prostitutes -- leaving them vulnerable to both their clients, their employers, and the law -- that their wishes are so easily disregarded. If the prostitution laws were reversed so that it is the johns and the pimps, not the prostitutes, who commit the crime, then prostitutes would have much greater power to avoid unwanted sexual contact and violence, and perhaps a much better chance of getting out of the business altogether.

Just look at the controversy over established science for example. It seems to me that lots of folks search out information that conforms to their own viewpoint and accept that, regardless of evidence to the contrary. ""I saw it on the internet, it must be right!"""
2945;7601;bank;1;0;to make money get rich be successful;criticize the banking system and propose nationalization.;The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew;The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew up on them and would increase their profits moderately if they were caught and had to pay modest fines. No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete. Nationalizing banks would make it clearer than ever that the banks were too big to fail (and could engage in even more risky behavior on more profitable terms than their competitors who lacked the too big to fail guarantee).

And if the profit is made at the EXPENSE of the society that allow the corporation to exist, well, too bad. Oil companies foul the environment. Financial companies drive the economy into the Great Recession. Airlines have no regard for the people they transport. As long as they make a profit, they are allowed to abuse the public until they are stopped. That is the way it has been since Swift and Armour canned and sold rotten meat and Carnegie sent Pinkertons to shoot striking miners.

USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice. I don't claim to be an expert, these are my prayerful thoughts on this topic. I believe that Reverend Robert Stearns speaks with wisdom, knowledge and insight.

They are a slap to the customer after the bill has been presented. They are an insult to both the customer and to the server. Frankly I do not like the feeling that I am obliged to supplement the wages paid to the server so that he or she can have a decent living. That cost should be part of the cost of the meal. Wait staff are properly the employees of the restauranteur - and his responsibility.

What kind of economist does that? Real economists who have really looked at this have discovered that the actual cost at retail of not using illegal labor is very small, under 5%. The actual farm labor costs are swamped by capital costs, storage, transportation and distribution, spoilage and retail markup. In addition, there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions.

How much of college fees go directly to athletics in which a small percentage of students participate? My daughter has a PhD and teaches at a state university with great athletics. She makes less than $45,000 a year although instructors have gone through an arbitration process. The school refuses to go along with the decision reached (for five years - wages frozen). With so many colleges not hiring, she considers herself lucky to have a job. And yet, the athletic department is not sharing the pain. It is time to recommit to the purpose of higher education. I am assuming here that it is not to teach football. If it is, then they should be paying tuition not getting athletic scholarships.

The gross immorality of modern war--war since Napoleon if not earlier--is that contestants are willing to kill for their cause, but not to die for it. The US killed far more people in Iraq than the 4000 or so Americans who fell there--the ratio seems to be tending toward thousands of civilians versus 0 soldiers. The drone makes the perfect war: they die (we don't know who), we live."
2955;5336;office layout;1;1;to be a good employee worker have private space leader;critical of open space office layouts.;I have yet to meet more than a few people that enjoy working in open space arrangements;I have yet to meet more than a few people that enjoy working in open space arrangements. Incubators or work-spaces have open spaces because it is significantly cheaper than having private work areas, and typically charge a lot more for use of the private spaces. This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth. In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable. But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept. There's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement. I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day.

He keeps talking about ""identifying, isolating and purifying something."" At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about ""identifying, isolating and purifying something,"" that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything."

Trying to fathom American opinion is not possible. Is it NOT counterproductive to do this phony PR or feel good thing for Israel when American clearly and increasingly sick of Israel and it's troublemaking.

If someone does not want their children to be vaccinated, that person should be required to post a bond to cover the potential damages. A bond should also be required by individuals claiming religious exemptions.

To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future.
2963;12071;noncompete deals;1;0;to be in control make money. money get ahead;the intention of the tweet is to criticize noncompete deals.;for decades now companies have been moving their manufacturing to low wage off shore locations to boost their profits;How ironic in which for decades now companies have been moving their manufacturing to low wage off shore locations to boost their profits yet they feel it necessary to attempt to legally inhibit an employee from moving on to a a better opportunity with another organization? Quite laughable when you think China, in particular, has paid little attention to patent rights and intellectual property, let alone their ongoing attempted hacking of American corporate secrets, yet, these companies remain there. If a company insisted on me signing such a questionable agreement, it is time to look elsewhere. The hypocrisy here is beyond the pale.

Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint.

There are investments and there is gambling. 10-millisecond holding time is not investment and does not create jobs except for some overpaid Wall Street types.

George Washington owned slaves and no one in his day thought him any the worse for it. Indeed, I dare say he would be hard pressed to understand, let alone consider, the arguments of anyone in today's world favoring reparations for what was a legal and acceptable practice in his day and age. People of every time and place should be seen in the terms of their own time and place - not ours. If history teaches us anythiing it might for us to examine the failures of the past and at least attempt not to repeat them in our present.
2967;11553;doctors caring about payments;1;1;to get a good grade the job done better;the author intends to criticize the medical system, particularly the financial incentives for doctors, and encourages patients to be more proactive and skeptical about their healthcare.;a doctor's compensation is based, essentially, on just one variable: The;I sincerely believe that I would have died many years ago had I not done my own homework, researched my doctors' counsel, and found their advice wanting. Just remember: In most cases, a doctor's compensation is based, essentially, on just one variable: The quality of forms submitted to third party payors, such as Blue Cross or Medicare. If the form looks alright, the doctor is paid, Whether you live, die, get better, don't get better or drop dead five minutes after you have exited the doctor's plush arrogant office, is really quite besides the point. Patients: Don't be so patient.
2968;5208;fema;1;1;to be prepared save lives helpful help;the intention of the tweet towards 'fema' is to support and advocate for the role of fema in disaster response.;This is what FEMA is FOR;We cannot depend on private industry to instantly know the best way to intervene in a disaster. There are problems that normal businesses simply don't prepare for - being cut off from supplies, having to work with only the employees that are able to show up, keeping track of things with no computers. This is what FEMA is FOR. They plan for this. They rehearse. They have experience with prior situations, and learn from each one what worked and what didn't. Why should communities re-invent the wheel? FEMA knows how to tap the local resources and guide them in how best to help. There HAS to be a centralized command structure so you don't end up with 25 truckloads of drinking water and no food. Do they always get everything right? Of course not. But I'll take my chances with an experienced crew over even the best intentions of someone trying to figure things out as they go.
2969;17837;persecution;1;2;to be helpful save lives fair help;the intention of the tweet towards target 'persecution' is to argue that assad is the lesser of two evils and that persecution under assad is less harmful than persecution under is.;Persecution under IS > Persecution under Assad;Yes. The US is on the wrong side. Dictators are terrible and evil people but they keep peace by consolidating power and preventing power vacuums that have allowed IS to run rampant across the Middle East. US foreign policy says that our nation has a fundamental right to protect freedom across the globe. This puts us at odds with Assad and IS. However, when determining what would be the most harmful, it is easy to see that Assad is the lesser of two evils. We have a duty to the persecuted. Persecution under IS > Persecution under Assad. Human life should not be summed down to such an ugly inequality, but for practical reasons, those are the facts.
2970;5781;office life;1;1;to be left alone alone. by himself themselves;the author's intention towards office life is to have a private office with a door and no telephone, and to have an employees' cafeteria or lounge for social needs.;I find most social situations a waste of my time;Personally I want a private office or work space with a door I can close. That's just me. If I could do without a telephone I think that would be heaven. An employees' cafeteria or lounge would be more than adequate to satisfy my social needs. Perhaps I feel this way because I was an only child and have always been content with my own company. I don't dislike company - I merely want to decide for myself when I want company and when I don't. I find most social situations a waste of my time. Why be bored to death at a party when there is a good book to read in the comfort of one's own home?
2971;8119;raising children;1;0;to be successful creative make money learn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'raising children' is to argue that a strict environment with limited play and relax time can negatively impact children's creativity and happiness in life.;Raising children in a strict environment with limited play, relax time reduces their creativity and;I agree with comment #115. Raising children in a strict environment with limited play, relax time reduces their creativity and happiness in life. Take the Chinese vs American businesses an as example. Chinese are very hard working and good at making replicas for less, but Americans generally less hard working are better at creativity and invention, like technology. Our less structured culture supports innovation and successes like facebook, apple etc.

I suspect it does, and if so, then Mr. Spinola is being intentionally deceptive which as a corporate shill is essentially his job. One additional quibble: the ultra-luxury developers are NOT primarily building housing. They are building investment opportunities for the super rich-- many of whom will do no more than stop by their apartments from time to time. The very LEAST the city can do is tax these properties equitably so the city can get some reasonable benefit from the fact that so much available land is being developed for non-use and thus crowds out housing opportunities for people who actually want to LIVE in NYC.

Wait, make that a casino with a really big army. Does anyone truly think that a business that is designed to churn money and skim some off the top has an social value in an economy that so recently created value by making things? Oh wait, I'm thinking of Wall Street. We're discussing casinos? Well, I guess we can say that casinos are a really fun way to pay stupidity taxes. Yes, that's it. As your money disappears you can, like a cat, watch shiny things go around in circles and bat at them. It's a testament to how far we've come that we're willing to call employing dealers and bouncers a boon to our economy. Yes, even in areas where moon-shining is still considered a career choice.

So because a fox can't take down a deer, it should secretly be an herbivore? And no, we don't look like grizzlies, but we do look a hell of a lot like chimps and other primates that will rip animals apart with their bare hands and ""digest the raw innards"" just fine. Please don't base your argument on ""the logic of the animal kingdom"" when you clearly have no concept of biology or evolution. You're a chef, so you presumably know a lot about food. Why not construct an argument around the food itself instead of a subject you don't seem to know anything about? Just a suggestion. Thanks. Hugs and kisses. P.S. How did this actually make it into print? NYT editors, I expected better."
2984;2823;adhd;1;1;to be a good student person teacher get better at something;the intention of the tweet towards target 'adhd' is to advocate for the use of medication in treating adhd.;If a child truly has ADHD, then denying them medication is the equivalent of denying;I have two extremely gifted children with ADHD. Their bodies are constantly in motion, and when they were younger, they could be up and wandering the classroom without even being aware of it. They would blurt out answers, talk with their peers, and fidget ceaselessly. Part of it was boredom, yes, but with medication, they were able to learn how to monitor their behavior, to slow down their bodies, and to interact appropriately with their classmates. The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior. We parents were able to teach them self-control techniques. As they aged, we were able to wean them off meds, and they function just fine in high school. Unmedicated, I doubt they would have received the appropriately differentiated education that has allowed them to succeed in school. If a child truly has ADHD, then denying them medication is the equivalent of denying a near-sighted child glasses.
2985;20427;status teacher;1;2;to be a leader protect the people save lives safe fair;the intention of the tweet towards'status teacher' is to criticize the use of drones in warfare and suggest targeting civilians as a matter of policy.;I wish we could draft the children and grandchildren of those who demand we conduct war by sending troops;The difference between us and them is that we don't target civilians as a matter of policy. That said, I wish we could draft the children and grandchildren of those who demand we conduct war by sending troops instead of drones.
2986;19976;enough;1;2;to be a racist leader they want help;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the income-based achievement gap is a result of underfunding of education and economic policies that create new lower classes for all races, and that race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need despite the recent economic downturn.;Economic policies of the conservatives have for years been working against the gains blacks made in past;If the income based achievement gap is now 2x the size of the race gap, that attests to our under-funding of education, and to our economic policies that create new lower classes for all races for decades. The living standards and security of all have been on a downward path. This shouldn't cancel race affirmative action, since that is an extra layer of roadblocks in the upward path for minorities. Economic policies of the conservatives have for years been working against the gains blacks made in past decades. So even if more whites are poor or near poor than before, still race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need. Our legal racial apartheid is all too recent-in my lifetime. And the policies and political messages of our dominant conservative party have still been amplifying negative race messages, using them to win elections.

Without a conscience, we would all be sociopaths. Corporations do not have a conscience, thus they need regulation to make sure they are focused on benefiting society instead on merely benefiting themselves.
2988;10271;law enforcement;1;1;to be helpful help others people;the intention of the tweet towards law enforcement is to suggest that it should focus on providing social resources and building trust in communities, rather than solely enforcing the law through punishment.;Arrest should be devoted to people who need social resource;"Great article. Arrest should be devoted to people who need social resource. That may mean help, control, or both. It changes people for the better and build trust. People are happier when they know their enforcement of the law is building bridges in communities that may need help. Everyone deserves objective feedback, no one deserves to be abused. Broken windows should be a policy of fixing little things and not draconian punishment for little failures. Cleaning up graffiti, getting kids off the street, and reducing sensational adult advertisement in family communities; those are broken windows. Change can be accomplished mostly by better alternatives and more second chances (learning to do better)."
2989;14114;their land;1;0;to enjoy the outdoors be in control beauty nature;the intention of the tweet towards 'their land' is to criticize the wealthy for their perceived entitlement to prevent others from accessing natural landscapes.;The wealthy have excelled at positioning their homes so they have the best views of the ocean,;The wealthy have excelled at positioning their homes so they have the best views of the ocean, the mountains, the lakes, and the forests. Isn't that enough? Why do they fell entitled to prevent anyone else from access to our natural landscape? The Romans were right, public beaches for all!

We forget we have an obligation to also teach our children;Good argument. We forget we have an obligation to also teach our children. A family vacation to the beach, the mountain or a foreign country is a subtle, pleasurable learning experience, and in addition, hopefully creating loving memories that last a lifetime.
2991;460;eating dairy;1;0;to be healthy healthy. not sick eat meat healthier;the intention of the tweet towards target 'eating dairy' is to promote a dairy-free diet due to ethical concerns about animal welfare.;I really think limited dairy has made a huge change. I do eat some, but;I quit eating beef over thirty years ago. I quit chicken five years ago, I had allergies my entire life, now, I have none. No stuffy nose or hives. I really think limited dairy has made a huge change. I do eat some, but it really made me sick when I did everyday. A very smart, organized person that enjoys cooking can design a diet without meat that is so heathy. When I saw how animals are raised for food, never seeing the sunshine or grass, shot up with antibiotic and chained to a metal pole (veal), or, dairy calves taken from their mother at birth, I as a mammal, could never accept such cruel behavior again.
2992;10327;teach;1;0;to get a good job education grade degree;teach civics and history to improve voter knowledge and understanding of complex issues.;Few people know the three branches of government. Or, the two bicameral branches;I read recently that only one-third of people on South Carolina know who the Vice-President of our country is. Few people know the three branches of government. Or, the two bicameral branches of legislation. Or practically any history before Madonna or Ms. Gaga. My mother only attended and was graduated from high school after only three years (she skipped twice) and took a course in basic civics... She knew far more than my undergraduate students at CUNY. So, kids who (if) they vote are basing their decisions with no knolwledge. Not to mention the sophisticated understanding that is required to understand this complex world. I don't want to appear cynical or paranoid but do the super rich or corporate interests prefer an electorate who knows politics and history -- or does it serve their interests as people become stupid and no nothing except about football or celebrities. Stupider! Yes, for sure. Absolutely! And it explains why high school students no longer take civics and know nothing.

Once children start driving they get addcted, doing it almost every day for the rest of their lives. They get irritable when driving privileges are taken away from them. And the danger ! We have plenty of research and $$$ have been spent on drunk driving education, yet people still drive drunk ! This is a crisis that can only be solved by throwing people in jail.

The technology separates the President, Secretary of State, and us citizens from the dead bodies, both correct and mistaken. The accidents are somehow even worse. I do not accept this mayhem conducted in my name.

We just paid the stated price for our meal, period. How simple! And I felt good that the waitstaff (and behind-the-scenes cooks and busboys) were making a good wage. I've waited tables and I know the thrill of big tips, but as a diner I now vastly prefer the flat-rate, no-tip system. End tips, raise my prices and pay the waitstaff a great wage, please!

So then we banned weed;And so it continues. First, we banned alcohol, but that didn't work. So then we banned weed, and that didn't work. Now we ban cigarettes, because we still despise poor people, but since poor people drink, let's go back to using bans on alcohol to attack them.

Benefits have become a thing of the past.;Unions are an endangered species. People are working longer for less pay. Benefits have become a thing of the past. Fire-at-will policies keep people under even more stress. The fact that people are making the best of their bad situation speaks to the resiliency of the human spirit far more than it is a defense of our new American serfdom.
3000;6250;food prices;1;0;to be healthy save money healthier eat less;the intention of the tweet towards target 'food prices' is to increase them through ending subsidies.;The price of food will rise, as it should, and the obesity epidemic will slowly become;What bunk. The worst dietary info we've gotten has been from the USDA! There's a very simple cure for the obesity epidemic. Stop subsidizing food. Americans spend far, far less of the income on food than those in other nations. End the farm subsidies. End the food stamp subsidies. Stop interfering with market mechanisms. The price of food will rise, as it should, and the obesity epidemic will slowly become a memory. The nanny state mentality is the source of most problems in this country.

And those pesky wines guzzled under the guise of Communion and Shabbos and Pesach celebrations, the true gateway paths. Banning the teen years would also be equally effective.
3002;10134;israel;1;0;to be in control power free independent;the intention of the tweet towards israel is to criticize its actions and policies in the conflict with the arabs.;When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which;Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.
3003;20084;beachfront home;1;2;to get rid of electricity electric something it;the intention of the tweet towards target 'beachfront home' is to express frustration with the negative impact of electric vehicles on the price and availability of gasoline-powered vehicles, and to suggest that the tweet's author is not interested in owning an electric vehicle.;phony reason not to have electric;amazing all the phony reason not to have electric..who is to gain for PLUG STATIONS. who is to gain for SPECIAL hook up at a house..who is to gain to smash or eliminate electric..and no--only the questions I ask help keep the electric auto off the street and at a higher price..even the 60mpg and high for gas was smashed decades ago...many examples..think..read..understand basics..

Tax capital gains as income. Period.;Is this some kind of joke? Tax capital gains as income. Period. Tax securities transactions too, most of all high frequency computerized front-running, and pay for national socialized medical care with it, like England does.

Is the Author suggesting that Israel doesn't fulfill the requirements for being a State? Israel barely fulfills any of the three requirements the Author considers ""essential elements"" for being a State: 1. Strong Government - Israel has a history of weak coalition governments, with the major parties hostage to extremist fringe minor partners. 2. Defined Borders - What are Israel's borders? '67 Armistice Lines? East Jerusalem? Settlements? 3. Security - The Israeli government keep claiming that Israel is under constant existential treat from its neighbors. PS Israel fulfilled non of these requirements when it was declared a State by the UN."

I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, but I can't deny the reality that I see constantly. Israel through its American supporters has an inordinate amount of influence over American policies. As more and more Americans come to realize this fact, they begin to resent it. I know I do. It must stop.

I just don't believe that the majority of parents are deliberately ruining their child's life by refusing academics and a social life. To the contrary, I regularly see early and avid readers, no reading gap between boys and girls, kids who go to college early (we have a great PSEO program in MN) and by all accounts, do very well in society.

Maybe we should all be multinational like our Oligarch CEOs? We have a Facebook billionaire who renounced his citizenship to avoid minimal taxes. We now have a failed candidate for the Republican party deciding a Swiss citizenship is better than one. In Ethnic America I belong to a small group that can have more than dual citizenship: how do you all feel about that? I swore an oath out of choice to be an American: I was merely born British. I think any American who chooses to be Swiss has a lot of explaining to do. We British do not think we are the best of the best but Michelle used to say America was the best nation, now she is not so sure?

Right on one count, wrong on the other. Hey, I know, let's lower the rim so everyone can dunk. Then it'll be even better, right?

Our economy would stop without gasoline and other;Exxon provides a public good, too. Our economy would stop without gasoline and other petroleum products. What people object to about huge college endowments is the sense they are more about hoarding and bragging rights than providing scholarships. Harvard is holding $30 billion. That money could provide an education to tens of thousands of students at many universities, but instead serves as a line item in the US News ranking of colleges suggesting that Harvard provides a superior education because they have this hoard. States should require these institutions to spend more of their endowments on services or, if they can't, share the money with other colleges or the state.

For a justice to make such partisan remarks is unwise and unseemly. If somehow Mr. Trump were to actually make it to the White House, any issue about his actions or presidency coming before the court would, ethically, demand that Justice Ginsburg recuse herself.

It really is just a way to reward the wealthy, such as yourself. And the lost revenue will make it even more difficult for the government to provide services.

Ever since 1947, the Arab world has rejected an independent Palestinian state because it has not been willing to recognize facts on the ground and make necessary concessions. Never before in history has there been an independence movement that rejected a state of its own because of a boundary dispute. There are close to 500,000 Israeli Jews living in Maale Adumim and other areas around Jerusalem. Israel cannot move them away kicking and screaming--as it did with settlers in Gaza. The Arab world has to stop making statements like the Three No's of Khartoum, which happened in 1967, and the refusal of the generous agreement that Clinton negotiated at Taba in the last moments of his presidency. Moving the Embassy to Jerusalem will tell the Palestinians that they have to compromise.

Israel has always ignored UN pledges for good faith negotiations with the Palestinians because US unwavering support. Washington, however, is losing diplomatic control over its allies and friends. Israel soon will be facing (another) awkward diplomatic position at the UN. It will be occupying land of an invaded sovereign state recognized by the world community. A good challenge for the able Israeli-American diplomacy to defend at the UN.

Our population is growing by about 30 million per decade!!! Just about all of the population growth results from immigration. So let's reduce immigration and also focus on reducing consumption.

However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this issue all year long, and for this 'room for debate' issue in particular. While the Times deemed it appropriate to ask a Muslim living in the UK to write on the issue (of course, pro migration) for the sake of journalistic integrity the Room for debate should have also hosted the point of view of a native European citizen from any country who opposes it. It has come to the point that the people with the most to loose and with all the rights, are pushed aside, their rights and opinions discarded.
3020;13546;capital gains;1;0;to help the poor be fair people fair.;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for a tax system that treats capital gains as ordinary income for individuals earning above $100,000, while maintaining the current tax rates for the wealthy.;do not end capital gains tax;No, do not end capital gains tax. Limit capital gains treatment to the first $100,000. Everything about that is taxed as ordinary income. Then we don't need to raise the taxes on the ultra rich...they will simply have to pay the taxes they are supposed to be paying now. and we wouldn't have the Warren Buffets or Mitt Romneys paying 13% in taxes while the poor grunts who have to actually work for a living and barely scraping by are paying twice that percentage.

First, we need to take their source of funding away- the true cost of oil must include the DoD budget and the environmental damage. With that thrown in solar and wind are pretty attractive. Second sanctions work. Third beat these guys in the long run using economics and disproving the religious nonsense. There is no god who demands you live any specific way, and there is no afterlife with 49 Virgina. Get these points across and the wind is out of their sails. Their style is unsustainable if they kill everyone and no neighbors will work with them. Not to mention how they compete economically in a modern world. It should be the role of the UN, the world court and their neighbors to police them, not us. I'm tired of seeing useless wars with my tax money enriching the one percent. Fix our problems. Fix the security council veto problem. Close our foreign bases. Cut our DoD budget by 60%.

For instance, soy does not contain estrogen. The molecular structure of soy appears similar to estrogen, but it is NOT estrogen and the body doesn't treat it as such. This is a myth, perpetrated by the dairy industry for obvious reasons. I am a vegan, and both my children are vegans from the day they were born. This is anecdotal evidence, but they are both usually tall, strong, healthy. One is getting a Ph.d and the other had a perfect score on the army intelligence test; both are irritating know it alls, definitely playing with full decks.. Because they were raised with compassionate hearts, they are both the kindest and most thoughtful people I know. Both of them have thanked me and their father repeatedly for raising them vegetarians."
3025;13888;vegan;1;0;to be healthy healthy. not hungry eat;the intention of the tweet towards target'vegan' is to suggest that a mix of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism is a good option for those who are flexible and willing to be open to different food sources.;Being flexible is a great thing, being too strict or restrictive doesn't help anyone;Lentils, whole beans, millets are great sources of B vitamins, their bioavailability increases if they are soaked overnight. Millets can even be sprouted then pound into a flour, they are gluten free. Some millets contain high amounts of calcium as well. Quinoa is another rich source of nutrition all around. As far as brain food is concerned, dairy and dairy products make up for lack of meat protein. However for stric vegans who exclude fairly products or those with lactose intolerance, meat and meat products is a good option. Being flexible is a great thing, being too strict or restrictive doesn't help anyone. Moderation is key, mix of vegetarianism, non vegetarianism is awesome, if one is willing to be flexible. Life is colorful not black and white so why limit food?
3026;19436;speech;1;1;to be inclusive respectful fair free;the intention of the tweet towards target'speech' is to criticize the long reach of the employer's arm legally and to express disapproval of mr. fenton's behavior while not condoning hateful language.;While I find Mr. Fenton's behavior appallingly violent and highly immoral;While I find Mr. Fenton's behavior appallingly violent and highly immoral, I also find the long reach of his employer's arm legally unsupportable. I wouldn't be surprised to see this man reinstated in the backlash. Being a democracy has always meant tolerating all manner of disrespectful and hateful language - as long as it remains language and not a specific call to violent action.
3027;13695;consumer education;1;1;to be healthy healthy. make a difference healthier change;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of a holistic, comprehensive approach to improving individual and population health, including consumer education and forced choice structural interventions.;forced choice structural interventions would likely do more quickly to move us to a healthy population than consumer;I was glad to see some of the opinion-writers acknowledge that we really don't know the effects on individual behavior and population health of changes like the ones WalMart, New York City and others are making in food content, availability, pricing, and information. These changes -- banning trans fats, reducing sodium, posting calorie information -- are made with the best of intentions: to improve individual and population health. But if people simply eat more, or salt food by hand once it disappears from processed food, or drink GatorAde rather than soda, we really won't have made much progress. There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing. Consumer education is great, but forced choice structural interventions would likely do more quickly to move us to a healthy population than consumer education would.

Wait, make that a casino with a really big army. Does anyone truly think that a business that is designed to churn money and skim some off the top has an social value in an economy that so recently created value by making things? Oh wait, I'm thinking of Wall Street. We're discussing casinos? Well, I guess we can say that casinos are a really fun way to pay stupidity taxes. Yes, that's it. As your money disappears you can, like a cat, watch shiny things go around in circles and bat at them. It's a testament to how far we've come that we're willing to call employing dealers and bouncers a boon to our economy. Yes, even in areas where moon-shining is still considered a career choice.

3030;19738;israel;1;2;to get a good education be parent job citizen person;the author's intention is to argue that everyone should contribute to education funding, as an educated population benefits everyone, regardless of whether they currently have children in school.;Everyone should pay for education because everyone benefits from an educated population;"""The sentiment is right: Home schooling parents shouldn't have to pay for schools they don't use then pay again for education they do."" The sentiment is completely wrong. Everyone should pay for education because everyone benefits from an educated population. I have no children in school today, but when I need a nurse or doctor in 30 years where will they come from if not from children my tax dollars are educating today? The question of how best to achieve high quality schools is another debate entirely. But the need for them is irrefutable."

I do not understand why my cat can get an additive free vaccine and my child cannot. How about demanding a change in the pharma industry to make the actual shots safer? There are known human carcinogens like formaldehyde and neurotoxins such as aluminum in many vaccines. Vaccine injuries are very real and a risk some are just not willing to take.
3032;15879;experience;1;1;to make more money get a job earn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'experience' is to express the author's negative view of charter schools and their working conditions.;Charter schools do not offer competitive salaries;I am in my 9th year teaching, and yes, I feel sorry for the students I had my first year. I am a good teacher today, and it did take about 5 years to reach that point. I have never worked in a charter school, but I did once interview at one (and decline the job offer), and I know several teachers who currently work at charters. Charter schools do not offer competitive salaries. In addition, charter school teachers have more duties and longer hours in school, so, after factoring in daily lesson planning on top of their extended hours, they work much longer, in poorer conditions (the shiny buildings don't mean good work conditions) with much lower salaries. No education professional actually believes that charter schools are hiring superior teachers.
3033;18366;israel;1;0;to be in charge control power a leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'israel' is to criticize israel for its influence on us foreign policy and its role in the colonization of captured territory, which is against the un charter, geneva conventions, and us law.;Because Israel buys Us politicians and influence in the USA;Threatening to attack Iran is against the UN Charter!! Colonization of captured territory is also against the Charter and the Geneva Conventions and against US law. Why is this not a major factor in the discussions? Because Israel buys Us politicians and influence in the USA. When most of the Middle East policy makers are or were Israel Firsters (Ross, Feith Frum, Abrams, etc) and purged the government of true diplomats then Israel ensured that the US did not have an independent foreign policy.

Which evolved ape is worthy of veneration? Maybe Dorothy Day. Certainly not Mother Theresa nor John Paul II. On top of that, the Catholic Church has provided a bureaucratic process to vet the applicants including proof of two miracles, which are usually a sham to push through the desired prospect. Who on earth would venerate dictators, corrupt financiers and evil bishops? Only the Catholic Church! Next they will be canonizing Scalia. Instead of picking the Catholic All-Star team, when will the Catholic Church celebrate the beauty and weaknesses of ordinary human beings?
3036;13020;history;1;1;to be a leader in charge control independent;the intention of the tweet towards target 'history' is to challenge the author's statement about the palestinian authority not meeting the essential elements for independence by pointing out historical examples of nations that declared independence without meeting those elements.;Please check upon a historian or read up your history. Trust me! It is true!!;"""But let's start with the basics. Any nation wishing to declare independence should meet three essential elements: a strong central government, control of defined territory and security. The Palestinian Authority does not yet meet any of them."" Historians would strongly disagree with you. Around sometime late eighteenth century some thirteen odd British colonies did ""declare independence"" without any resemblance of ""strong central government"" with its territory controlled by the British. Today a certain French foreign minister called it a ""hyper-power"" and not a ""failed state"". Please check upon a historian or read up your history. Trust me! It is true!!"

I have my own business in a cube in an incubator-type space in Manhattan to save on real estate costs. While it's big enough and the walls are 6 ft. high, it's still very hard to do any of my deep thinking/focused-task work there so I often wind up going back at night for several hours to get that type of work done. All it takes is one person with a loud voice to make it difficult to focus; with a few around me, it's impossible. I wonder daily if the money I save is worth it."
3038;16099;solo vacation;1;1;to be alone left alone. have a break get away;the intention of the tweet towards'solo vacation' is to express a desire for a temporary escape from family responsibilities due to mental illness and low standards of behavior.;My ideal solution would be to take a vacation without the kids and the husband;I agree with the poster who said there's no one-size approach to this question. My ideal solution would be to take a vacation without the kids ~and~ the husband. Of course, you don't know my family. You think that's heartless and selfish until I explain that I live with the exasperating reality of a husband with mental illness and five step-kids two of whom also have mental illness, who spend the majority of their time with a mom who has very low standards for her own behavior let alone theirs. Yeah, I know- it's my bed, I'll lie in it. But a couple nights to lie in it alone would be nice.

But the real health benefits will come only when folks consume a whole food based plant diet. The problem is that animal products, such as meat, fish and dairy CAUSE chronic disease. Lowering sugar, salt and fat is a start. Eliminating sugar, added salt and all animal products will result in a healthier population. Of course, if Walmart were to eliminate selling meat, dairy, soda, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, candy, junk food, etc., then nobody would shop there. Expect Walmart to get great press reviews, but disease to continue.

That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means."

Having foreign and out;The costs of running a university have been increasing alarmingly. Having foreign and out of state students paying full tuition seems like a good response, but it becomes a chicken and egg situation: which caused the other? What has caused the administration outnumber or nearly outnumber teaching staff? I especially am unhappy with large increases in foreign students because they can use the state-side degree to help short-cut visa rules: foreign students are effectively paying tuition as a penalty or fee to get access visa ahead of less wealthy applicants. The admissions office can hold a lot of power over foreign students with little clear oversight.

And on top of all of this, taxpayers get to cover their losses, virtually pay the bloated compensation of their CEOs and lobbyists while the masters of the universe get to listen to their mouth pieces in Congress demean hard working Americans. Yep, these settlemts say a lot; none of it good for our country, our economy or most of the humans who work hard and cannot seem to get a head."

What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis?
3047;8944;wikipedia;1;1;to make a point be helpful knowledgeable learn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'wikipedia' is to highlight the challenges of writing a wikipedia article and the importance of teaching students how to use digital tools more consciously.;Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because;I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate. However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality.
3048;20058;marijuana gateway drug;1;2;to be helpful supportive help them;the intention of this tweet is to promote a balanced approach to parenting, emphasizing both unconditional love and the importance of a child's independence, supported by parental advice when needed, encapsulated by the concept of positive reinforcement.;marijuana gateway drug;Unconditional love combined with the parent fondly expecting the child to be the best he can be. As the child grows older, he needs to separate from his parents and this should be respected. But the parent is always there if the child needs advice. To sum up this approach: Positive Reinforcement
3049;2801;usa involvement;1;0;to be in control charge power a leader dictator;the intention of the tweet towards target 'usa involvement' is to criticize the us government's decision to intervene in syria and its perceived lack of consistency in its foreign policy.;The USA seems to be taking a step back in time with Kerry at State.;Kerry's threat to punish a country that violates the US Government's sense of morality and obscenity -- in the absence of any threat to the US -- will tear US society apart. His advocacy of war to overturn the government of that disfavored country places him in something close to the posture of a colonial ruler. If the standards applied to Syria today had been applied to Iraq in the 1970's, we would have intervened in Syria back then. The USA seems to be taking a step back in time with Kerry at State.

It really is just a way to reward the wealthy, such as yourself. And the lost revenue will make it even more difficult for the government to provide services.

Yes, fundamentalist Christians are going to come in for some nasty words but so far, there has been no violence. Days after the attack, I'm feeling like other victims should be taking center stage at the moment, than those who may not have received the warmest welcome for their thoughts and prayers. And besides those in Orlando, there is a steady stream of adolescents being roughed up in the locker rooms of America. Gotta say, that's where my heart goes at the moment."
3054;19074;vacation;1;1;to be a good parent father have family fun;the intention of the tweet towards target 'vacation' is to emphasize the importance of family vacations and cherishing time together.;We rarely took vacations, but when we did it was as a family;When a couple decides to have children, the children become an integral part of the family and should not be excluded from family adventures unless a child has so severe a disability that he or she cannot go. We rarely took vacations, but when we did it was as a family. Now that our children are grown and all moved away, we seldom see them, so those together times have become even more precious. Children grow up so fast--enjoy them as much as you can. Carve out time for yourselves by enforcing an early bedtime for the offspring.

3056;19582;farm;1;2;to be healthy healthier successful win;the intention of the tweet towards target 'farm' is to argue that it is possible for a vegan athlete to reach elite levels, but it is likely a fluke and not because of their vegan diet.;he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete;Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people.
3057;678;your cat;1;1;to save the cats animals;the intention of the tweet towards 'your cat' is to express concern about the potential negative impact of declawing on cats and the possibility of euthanasia.;cats with front claws often do terrible damage to furniture;Bravo! cats with front claws often do terrible damage to furniture. While it is politically correct to object to it, the fact is there will be fewer homes for cats, who will end up being euthanized. The comparison isn't between an imaginary garden of Eden and declawing, but rather the choice is between more feral cats and more put down. Those of us who love cats don't want to see well-meaning humans decree that millions of cats suffer to meet the needs of humans.
3058;5271;linkage between tax rates and unemployment rates;1;1;to help the poor poor. get a better deal be fair;the intention of the tweet is to propose a linkage between tax rates and unemployment rates, with a lower tax rate for lower unemployment rates.;an obvious solution is to tie the tax rate to unemployment;Hate to point out an obvious solution is to tie the tax rate to unemployment. If the unemloyment rate falls below 3% or 4% then lower the rate. At present, I would be looking at a 50% or better tax rate. I seem to recall statements when referencing the poor that they need to earn benefits. Well it would seem that corporate and the rich should need to earn their lower tax rate.

China is by all accounts still very undemocratic and is fighting the tail end of a Civil War with the Chinese Nationalists with which Taiwan had very little to do, but Taiwan's future as a free and democratic nation is now being held hostage to that Civil War. The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member. In the 1950s and 1960s we made the mistake of isolating China. Now we are making the mistake of letting Taiwan dangle in diplomatic isolation. The people in Taiwan deserve better from us.

Managers should be required to disclose weaknesses to shareholders in all companies, and potential shareholders in publicly traded companies, 2. Companies that do business with the Federal government, especially those with defense contracts, should be required to disclose hacking attempts as a matter of national security. 3. Companies who maintain databases of customers that include personal and financial information, including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other such data, should be required to disclose hacking attacks to their customers. Now there may be some companies out there who don't fall under one of those three categories, but I think that pretty much covers the waterfront.

Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births.
3062;20804;europe;1;2;to make more money money. a profit;the intention of the tweet towards target 'europe' is to criticize the incentives set up in europe that promote factory farming over self-employment on farms.;There are plenty of middlemen who would garner their profits on the increased wages;There are plenty of middlemen who would garner their profits on the increased wages. None would forego their cut -- and the retailer gets the largest share of that. Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects. If more people could employ themselves on farms, we might have a better outcome. But our incentives are not set up to promote that. Correct the incentives. We don't need more factory farms.
3063;16338;in state tuition;1;1;to get a good job education have better;the author's intention towards in-state tuition is to express frustration and disappointment with the current system that denies access to affordable education based on residency.;It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition;My daughter was rejected by four UC schools, and yet, was accepted to NYU, Boston University, North Eastern, George Washington, and University of Maryland. She had a 3.9 GPA, multiple AP courses and 2200 on her SAT. It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University. She is thriving at NYU and she is fortunate that I could afford to send her there. I have been taxes for decades as a resident of California and was denied access to one of the best University systems in the US. Something is wrong with the system.
3064;21771;tip;1;2;to be healthy healthy. not sick eat;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tip' is to provide a counterargument to the idea of veganism, stating that it may not provide sufficient energy and nutrients for the body, and may not be suitable for babies' development.;A diet based on plants does not provide a sufficient source of energy to the body;Even though I have to respect the reasoning to veganism, I do believe that there are definite risks involved. A diet based on plants does not provide a sufficient source of energy to the body. Without a source of protein or carbohydrate, the body tends to slow down and function slower. Facts are facts. All of them in the article stand firm. Babies need a variety of foods especially because it is critical in their development. As an adult you can make this decision for yourself, but think of your child who needs all the foods from the pyramid to grow and be the healthy individual you want them to be.
3065;5420;slavery in the u.s.;1;1;to make a difference change the law point be free;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the abolition of slavery in the united states.;Unless the thirteenth amendment is replaced with an amendment that does not institute slavery in the whole;Unless the thirteenth amendment is replaced with an amendment that does not institute slavery in the whole of the United States, we will have this debate. Slaves are inherently disenfranchised and all felons are slaves. This fact should not continue to be ignored.
3066;13529;dangerous jobs;1;1;to make more money money. earn;the intention of the tweet towards target 'dangerous jobs' is that the author believes that people do dangerous jobs because they are paid more than they could make at any other available job, which is a matter of wages.;For $60K/year, I betcha lots of people would learn to pick vegetables and;Mining is also an intolerable job, but people do it because they are paid much more than they could make at any other available job, I believe about $60K/year which is good money in the poor parts of the country. LOTS of jobs are difficult and/or dangerous but they pay enough to attract people, at least people who don't readily have better options. This is STRICTLY a matter of wages. For $60K/year, I betcha lots of people would learn to pick vegetables and fruit.
3067;6831;local talent;1;1;to be the best a leader make difference creative;the intention of the tweet towards target 'local talent' is to acknowledge their value and importance in the field of architecture.;privileging'starchitects'' over the local talents;The unacknowledged advantage of privileging 'starchitects'' over the local talents is that the first come with a set of standards, a rigorous vocabulary and a name that prevail over the compromises usually inherent in a developer-driven culture (cost cuts, value-engineering, the client's 'taste', etc. - whatever could damage a project from the design phase to the actual built outcome). If one looks objectively, disregarding personal taste, whether it is a Gehry, a Nouvel or Isozaki building here in New York - they all stand out as impeccably executed architecture. Most of them relate to their context (see the formal empathy between the Beekman Tower and Woolworth Building, for instance), or creating a new one where such context is either weak or lacks character. It is a welcomed fad that reinstates the lost 'edge' New York once had, and subliminally educates both the developers' taste and the local crop of professional talents. Why should we be afraid of that?...
3068;19290;flu shot;1;1;to protect their children his child save lives;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'flu shot' is to advocate for mandatory vaccinations for all children, including flu shots, as a means of protecting public health and preventing the spread of diseases.;"Those ""withholding"" parents are no better than the selfish fools who won't";"Of course vaccines should be required for all children, despite whatever religious or philosophical reasons parents might have for withholding such preventative medical care from their children. Why? Because we live in a cooperative society where our actions have direct implications on the lives and wellbeing of others. Those ""withholding"" parents are no better than the selfish fools who won't get a flu shot because, ""everyone else gets them, so I don't need to."" Spanish Flu killed 20 million people, yet today's parents still have the gall to say the medical onus should be on others, not them. For all those parents out there who don't want your child immunized, try living for one year in a third- or fourth-world country where immunizations are rare (if they exist at all), and your kid is exposed to myriad diseases all but extinct in our society. You'd be terrified to let your kid play with neighborhood kids, yet here you think nothing of exposing other people's children to the same. Vaccinations should be mandatory. It's time religion and philosophy (which are one in the same) take a back seat to rationality and public health."
3069;15218;every known human society;1;1;to be in control power charge free women;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the argument that prostitution is inherently coercive and unrealistic, by pointing out that it exists in various forms in different societies, including those with strict penalties.;I also question the realism of your argument;"Ms Ramos don't adult women have the right to decide what they do or do not want to do ? Isn't it equally coercive to restrict their freedom ? I also question the realism of your argument. AFAIK, prostitution seems to be a major sector of every known human society, in societys with strict penaltys (even death) and in societys where it is legal Isn't crimminlization like prohibition - something doomed to failure, as banning prostitution is like banning alcohol, or other drugs, perhaps desirable, but doomed to fail because it goes against human nature ? I think you are also confusing social class with prostitution; much prostituion is unpleasant because it is around poverty, just as coal mining is unpleasant."
3070;19485;charter schools;1;0;to be a leader in control charge fair;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the ban or refusal of funding for charter schools that discriminate against the poor and minority.;Charter schools are a failed experiment in new ways to discriminate against the poor and minority;Did anyone expect this NOT to happen? Charter schools are a failed experiment in new ways to discriminate against the poor and minority. Ban such schools, or at least refuse to give one single dime to schools that discriminate like this. Lay down the law with these schools that invent new ways to do evil.
3071;6079;memory;1;1;to be alone alone. have a vacation fun;the intention of the tweet towards the target'memory' is to express gratitude and appreciation for happy family memories.;very very happy memories of family vacations with the kids;I have very very happy memories of family vacations with the kids- and would not change those for the world. Perhaps the difference is the kids were well behaved? From looking at these posts, it seems alot of parents are extremely anxious to get away from their children. I think getting away for a romantic weekend sans children is great- but for big 2 week summer vacations, I would find it unthinkable to go without the children and to have them miss this experience. I would think this sends a message to the kids that you really don't like them very much- perhaps theyre right.
3072;12904;veganism;1;0;to be healthy healthy. avoid getting sick healthier;the author's intention is to emphasize the individuality of dietary needs and health, drawing from their personal experiences, and discourage telling others what to eat based on personal beliefs.;diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things;I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.
3073;16458;labor;1;0;to make money. a profit living money;criticizes the impact of labor on agriculture and the economy.;What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost;"Dr Gallardo says: ""Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples)."" Now let's ask what Dr. Gallardo has avoided telling us: ""What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost."" In most agriculture, land rents, the landowners' profits are the major chunk of full costs. If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down, bearing the brunt of the increased cost of labor. There is no reason fore the land to disappear. There are not that many alternative uses. It's not like farmers, who claim to have built the land with their own two hands, will stop building land. Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich? Why is that a fair policy? And who among the Times six ""experts"" (including ""immigrant advocates"") is here to represent the interests of American workers who are required to work for less because of illegal immigration?"

Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims? Those who punished him are just getting upset for nothing. Can the burning of a Bible or a Koran means war? this is stupid. People must learn to not get upset for things like that. To convince about God, please don't use terrorism or bullying... use love, reasoning, and wisdom
3075;16580;paying full tuition;1;0;to get a degree have more students job make money be rich;the intention of the tweet towards target 'paying full tuition' is to criticize the practice of foreign and out-of-state students paying full tuition, stating that it is a chicken and egg situation and that foreign students can use state-side degrees to short-cut visa rules.;foreign students are effectively paying tuition as a penalty or fee to get access visa ahead of less;The costs of running a university have been increasing alarmingly. Having foreign and out of state students paying full tuition seems like a good response, but it becomes a chicken and egg situation: which caused the other? What has caused the administration outnumber or nearly outnumber teaching staff? I especially am unhappy with large increases in foreign students because they can use the state-side degree to help short-cut visa rules: foreign students are effectively paying tuition as a penalty or fee to get access visa ahead of less wealthy applicants. The admissions office can hold a lot of power over foreign students with little clear oversight.
3076;3869;beach walks;1;1;to be safe get exercise have fun swim;the intention of the tweet towards target 'beach walks' is to express frustration and disappointment towards the council for not taking proper care of the beach, and to highlight the safety measures taken by the surf club during beach walks.;Each morning I get up and walk miles along the beach and the council takes time to look after;Private beach, insane. Each morning I get up and walk miles along the beach and the council takes time to look after it. The surf club make sure I am safe when I swim between the flags. What more do Americans want, part of the air? Look what I own...sand.

Compare;Let's not forget that Amy Chua is a professor At Yale and that she can point that out to her children if they ever question her methods Having the street cred when it comes to imparting such strict discipline is pretty useful. Compare that to the run of the mill parent trying to be strict. Generally,there will be rebellion.
3078;7140;food additives;1;0;to be healthy healthy. eat food;the intention of the tweet is to raise awareness about the lack of transparency in the food industry and the potential dangers of food additives.;fructose and sugar in almost everything produced for consumption;The whole world of nutrition is a mind field for most. Most of our meats are and fowl are raised in a manufactured environment. We have no idea what these animals and fowl are fed or injected with. We assume our vegetables and fruits are free of pesticides, who knows. Then of course we have fructose and sugar in almost everything produced for consumption. Labels are simply mind boggling as they will state ingredients, but there is no reference compared to what. Example when you see the sodium content, the culprit of High blood pressure , what % is dangerous?
3079;18827;employers taking too much credit;1;0;to be fair fair. compensated paid;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the legal assumption that employers create all the value and deserve all the credit in noncompete agreements.;And noncompetes assume that, whatever the intellectual property is, the employer created all the value;If an employee knows enough to truly hurt you, perhaps he should be paid accordingly. And noncompetes assume that, whatever the intellectual property is, the employer created all the value and deserves all the credit and the employee none. While that may be the current legal situation, there is very little that's realistic about that assumption.

Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education."
3081;4539;chef;1;0;to be healthy eat meat live longer fit;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'chef' is to criticize the chef's argument and qualifications.;What are this guy's qualifications? He's a chef, not an evolutionary bi;This argument is seriously flawed. What are this guy's qualifications? He's a chef, not an evolutionary biologist. Every living thing has evolved with certain traits that have enabled it to thrive. No, we may not have the speed and strength to kill a deer with our bare hands. But we have other evolutionary advantages that have enabled us to eat animals. Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet. If we weren't fit to eat animals we'd be extinct by now. Eating raw meat makes people sick because modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination. It's also the modern industrial diet that has lead to our current health problems (diabetes, heart disease, etc.) If people ate the way they did a hundred years ago and earlier (including eating meat) we'd all be a lot healthier. It's not meat that's the problem.
3082;5574;a tax break;1;1;to be a good citizen have better education person parent leader;the intention of the tweet towards target 'a tax break' is to encourage more homeschooling.;if a tax break will encourage more of it, great;I don't understand the hostility to homeschooling. How is it a 'threat to public education'? Hasn't public education set up enough of its own threats? Like, utterly unsustainable and irrational job protections for teachers regardless of ability or effectiveness? The way public education is now is itself a threat to our future standing in the world. I cheer on the homeschooling movement, hope to join it one day, and if a tax break will encourage more of it, great.
3083;17165;servant;1;0;to be in charge control helpful not overwhelmed;the intention of the tweet towards'servant' is to suggest that the royal family may have servants to help with their household and childcare responsibilities, relieving them from the daily pressures of parenting.;Just as their housework will be given over to servants, much of their childcare will be;Just as their housework will be given over to servants, much of their childcare will be given over to nannies. I am sure they won't be ignoring the kids, but I am equally sure they won't be overwhelmed by the day-to-day, sometimes hour-by-hour, pressures of parenting either. Royal or not, there are too many billions between the Windors and the average family.
3084;11146;self-regulation;1;0;to be in charge control a leader responsible;criticizes self-regulation by companies as flawed and harmful.;While waiting for the markets to punish companies for bad behavior, many people are harmed;The idea that Mr. Adams supports--self-regulation by companies--is deeply flawed. While waiting for the markets to punish companies for bad behavior, many people are harmed. The harm can be both financial and physical. The lag time between the misdeed, the discovery, and the correction can be years. Many of the regulations we have in place are reactions to the failure of individuals and companies to behave in ethical and legal ways. Businesses fumbled away their opportunities for self regulation a long time ago. That said, businesses still have a right to participate in the writing of regulations, as do their customers and other stakeholders. Regulations are, by nature, burdensome. Often the weight of the burden is prompted by the serious nature of the original offense.

When they are willing to call off their shoe bombers and underwear bombers and others trying to blow up my airplane or hijack it and fly it into a building, then I will oppose trying to take out their leaders with drones. While that group of thugs is trying to kill us at home and killing us abroad, I am for taking out their leaders."
3086;17506;tolerance;1;1;to be inclusive respectful accepted kind;the intention of the tweet is to promote tolerance towards the lgbt minority.;Tolerance and equal treatment is the minimum expected for all human beings;The LGBT minority must repent for not valuing and respecting the non-LGBT majority. As far as we know all of the disciples were heterosexual married men. Jesus was not engaged in a gay pride parade during his 3 year ministry. And Jesus did not just come to suffer without knowing the joys of food, dancing, alcolhol and sex. And we do know that without the two biological human sexes contributing an XX and an XY that the human race would be doomed. Tolerance and equal treatment is the minimum expected for all human beings. The LBGT that were targeted in Orlando were predominantly black African American and brown Latino Hispanic American.

And what of products that only kill occasionally, at statistically low levels? Should predictable death rates be acceptable until and unless they rise to a volume that a law firm is willing to take on as a class action suit or that they break through to mass media coverage? Ian Adams' position is not only flawed, it is morally repugnant.

This kind of untaxed capital gains will create a lot of speculation in the market and will eventually bring the market down. for what it is worth the short term versus capital gains at least has slowed some speculative activities.

The reality is quite the opposite: money is far more authoritative than egalitarian, as those with the most money will always win in this situation. Everyone's greenbacks may be worth the same, but those with more greenbacks will be worth more. Therefore, the current system may be a pain, but it is far more egalitarian in its fairness than a system that allows those with the most money to go to the head of the line."

3094;5358;inner city;1;1;to be a teacher get job teach the kids helpful;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'inner city' is to criticize the lack of support and resources for teachers in low-performing schools in the inner city, particularly in terms of classroom management skills.;In the inner city situation you need more than academics. You need classroom management skills;Thank you! I taught for nine years in Watts at one of the lowest performing schools in Country. The teach for America kids were great but their motives were 'on to bigger and better things' Not one of them stuck around after a year or two. Further, I felt they were treated,more often than not, as warm bodies to fill staffing shortages. Which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing but there appeared, at least in the situation I observed, to be absolutely no support for them once they were in the classroom. It was kind of like dropping somebody into a combat situation with no arms training. In the inner city situation you need more than academics. You need classroom management skills.

However, I don't have a high income, nor do I make crucial contributions to domestic economic growth. All my spendable income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains. The total is about the reported median Adjusted Gross Income of Federal tax returns. (I have non-spendable taxable income due to converting money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.) I don't think it would be fair for me to pay no income tax while someone with the same amount of income from labor pays income tax. Count me among those who prefer a democracy that is economically non-optimal to a plutocracy that is economically optimal.
3097;8892;illegal immigration;1;0;to get a job make money. money be independent;the intention of the tweet is to argue against illegal immigration and its impact on the economy and society.;They have to be kept out of the country;No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights.

In Silicon Valley, there are many non-Caucasian children of multimillionaires, who live in $3 to $15 million houses, receive as much tutoring and college counseling help as they need, attend expensive summer camps/programs, and travel the world before they are 18 years old. They don't need preferences when it comes to school and college admissions.

Many that I have met have an extremely shallow knowledge of this category of learning. In contrast librarians have a tremendous base of knowledge that guides not just students but the teachers within a school. Beyond the love books and knowledge librarians empower students to go beyond google, they help students learn differentiate and validate information in the sea of misinformation that characterizes the internet today. Yes teachers and schools can stumble on without a librarian, but it is as if we would ask a child to each McDonalds for a meal everyday. Their education is ultimately nutrient diminished.
3101;13684;politics;1;1;to kill people save lives be feared;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the use of drone strikes in politics and the potential for them to be used against the us.;Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were;Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague.

Tighter income/subsidy caps are needed. Programs that encourage innovation instead of requiring farmers to maintain subsidized acreages and surplus production. If we use black-and-white thinking and eliminate the entire program, the largest corporate farms will benefit. The smaller farms cannot compete against the cost efficiencies that come with scale. The health of our farms is important. Our farmers are stewards of our agricultural soils, arguably our most valuable natural resource. Let's not play politics with our land. Thoughtful reform instead of knee-jerk reactions to a system plagued with problems.

Since there is NO such thing as addiction to marijuana, the above is total nonsense.

3106;16554;tip;1;0;to get a raise make money. money be generous paid;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tip' is to criticize and question the practice of tipping in restaurants.;Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom;I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you.

However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this issue all year long, and for this 'room for debate' issue in particular. While the Times deemed it appropriate to ask a Muslim living in the UK to write on the issue (of course, pro migration) for the sake of journalistic integrity the Room for debate should have also hosted the point of view of a native European citizen from any country who opposes it. It has come to the point that the people with the most to loose and with all the rights, are pushed aside, their rights and opinions discarded.

His income derives from thousands of articles like this and similar venemous innuendos, divisive fabrications and plain lies, to justify his next pay period. The pain, suffering, blood and deaths that I have seen and endured since 1959 in Cuba, as a result of this unjustifiable. artificial divide, demands better from all of us. If the US could become allied with Germany and the horrors it committed in Buchwand and Treblinka, if Viet Nam has been willing to forgive our henious deeds, Chile have made peace with Pinochet torturers and Nelson Mandela gave the world the greatest lesson in forgiveness, why is it, the US, even with a President, who have seen abuse, segregation and marginalization first hand, continue doing the same and expecting a different outcome in Cuba?

She presents her own personal experience as though it is reflective of all Asian families and negates the existence of individual differences within a culture. Morever, her extreme parenting style, with a decided emphasis on the child performing in ways to meet the parent's needs and expectations, negates the existence of a child as an individual separate from the parent.

If they get tax breaks, then what about the people who never had children--should they as well? What about people who don't have children in school any longer? You get what you pay for America.

When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me.

The fact is that that EVERYONE has a vested interest in the education of the kids in their communities,therefore everyone should pay. Let anyone school their kids however they want, but don't jeopardize the education of the public as a whole, to grant favoritism to a few who school their children in one certain way.
3115;4689;foreign languages;1;0;to learn something new get a job degree gain knowledge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'foreign languages' is to criticize the study of foreign languages in american colleges and universities as being a fraud and not providing students with the necessary skills to hire an amburga abroad.;the study of foreign languages is a fraud;No Europeancountry I am aware of requires the study of a foreignlanguage at the undergraduate level. That is taken care of, usually very well, at the high school level. At most American colleges and universities, the study of foreign languages is a ditributioin requirement. Thios preserves jobs for faculty, but in most cases, after a year of study, the student may or may not be able to hire an amburga abroad. In short, like so much else in our colleges, the study of foreign languages is a fraud. I wish all the passionate hearts here had been fighting for rigor at our colleges. The whole shebang is tumbling down--and for good reason. Higher ed in the US is costly beyond reason, and fundamentally dishonest.

Too many times, the syllabus for any given course is behavior focused with no mention of the topic material to be covered. I also have to agree with one of the commentators below. Language Arts and similar classes are not academically challenging for good readers because of the need to accommodate those who struggle. I don't object to helping those who struggle but I would certainly let my child opt out of classes where he/she does not learn anything new. I'd also opt out of the character education training, which too often, requires students to respect everyone's opinion.

Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births.

They are our investment in a responsible, civil society. Everyone benefits when every citizen is able to read, write, understand history, geography, and government, and certainly to understand and be able to do practical, everyday mathematics. Therefore it is every citizen's duty to provide (pay for) schools open to everyone.

Of course charter schools are cherry picking. I live right in the middle of charter school and quasi-charter school heaven in Arizona, and cherry picking is exactly what's going on. If the parent's not engaged, the child doesn't get in in the first place. If the child's not engaged or disruptive, the child is O-U-T out, pronto.

We are all aware of the fact that congress does not like to police its own and ethics committee hearings are often a joke. Nevertheless a wealthy politician has the same weaknesses of the flesh as the guy of more modest means he can just afford to hire better attorneys and public relations people.

3124;5285;america teachers;1;1;to teach others be helpful educated;criticize the lack of professionalism in education.;In what other profession would it be assumed that minimal training, no matter how well-educ;A retired teacher who observed, and often mentored, many Teach for America teachers, I whole-heartedly support Ms. Crocco's observations. In what other profession would it be assumed that minimal training, no matter how well-educated one happens to be, is sufficient to enter the field: law, medicine? The fact we not only allow it, but encourage such an approach in eduction to me says a great deal about how teaching is viewed in this country, that is, it is not truly a profession. One will never build a first-class educational system based on this widely held conviction. For further thoughts, I refer the reader to the book by Diane Ravitch (one of the best historians of American schools) The Death and Life of the Great American School system.
3125;7284;social drug;1;1;to get away from something rid of high. high;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the assertion that marijuana is a harmful drug and to argue that it is a social drug.;Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug I smoked it;"I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause ""like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY. It's called ""being stoned""."
3126;19843;nation;1;2;to know the truth facts be informed understood;the intention of the tweet towards target 'nation' is to criticize the biased reporting in mainstream media and to advocate for the importance of comments sections in providing balance and fact-checking.;Oftenthe comments sections are where the biased reporting is set to rights;Oftenthe comments sections are where the biased reporting is set to rights. Unfortunately for those of us who used to rely on the NYT to be unbiased straightforward reporting, thst has changed. As a result, opinions are presented as facts. Words pregnant with multiple meanings are used to slant stories to placate corproate owners. Comments give those of us who read other sources like European papers to as a bit of balance and to fact check the fact checkers. Comments are important. Those who don't like them have very likely been found out once to often by observant readers and they want it to stop! Let the people talk.

I love books and libraries. However, my kid being in elementary school, and having Library as special subject (along with music, gym, art, computers), I often think he better had a foreign language or something else instead of Library. The teachers already teach regularly the students about books and authors, and help them in this domain, in addition to very accessible local libraries and children librarians.
3128;16909;visas for temporary farm laborers;1;0;to save money money. make a profit;the intention of the tweet towards target 'visas for temporary farm laborers' is to suggest that the author believes that providing visas for temporary seasonal workers would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions.;there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need;I don't see much real data in this. What kind of economist does that? Real economists who have really looked at this have discovered that the actual cost at retail of not using illegal labor is very small, under 5%. The actual farm labor costs are swamped by capital costs, storage, transportation and distribution, spoilage and retail markup. In addition, there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions.

Why not not follow the morally correct policy of non-intervention....here in may come to the often discussed but rarely published adage ""Let them kill each other off"" which poses no dangers for us.

3134;11356;isi;1;0;to win the war be in power a leader control charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'isi' is to argue against the moral equivalence between assad and isis and to suggest a political solution to the syrian conflict.;Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equival;Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible.
3135;8076;college sports;1;1;to be successful have fun competitive get better;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for reform of the ncaa and its culture, while also emphasizing the importance of college sports for personal and professional development.;Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me;Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money.

We all had a great time;"In 1959 or so our family took an epic car trip around New York State and Connecticut. My brother, sister, and I still talk about that trip - good memories. My wife and I always took our kids on vacations. We all had a great time and I hope that their memories of these trips is as fond as ours are. Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. ""In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!"""

Seriously? Procedures & materials for road repair? Medical practices in surgery? Proper chemicals used to treat the town water? We could all have opinions on these but are they professional or informed? Parents do not have a six-year degree and teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design - just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. If individuals are so fearful and filled with anxiety & distrust of modern society, isnt that a private matter for the family and perhaps a mental health professional to deal with vs. these private fears being foisted on the general public who want modern medecine, scholarly education, and sound civic operations to be able to do their best for us. This attitude of ""Some of my tax money is involved so I wish to inject my own set of facts and opinions with a red face and a loud voice like I've seen on Fox News"" is getting out of hand."

My husband's and my parents are older than most, more fragile, grappling with health issues, dementia, financial, housing, and end-of-life difficulties. They need every bit as much attention as our teenagers do. As do our careers, at peak. So which of these competing interests gets short- changed? There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish fervently I'd had my kids in my twenties. They'd be grown by now, and I could take at least one thing off my plate. I am tired. I'd love to be able to kick back and enjoy grand kids and nothing else."

So charge them - OT makes this possible by requesting a charge card to hold a reservation! You are trying to justify a tactic of bribery.

We need to start by acknowledging that students who want to learn need an environment where they can. Charter schools can do a good job of this. But the other half of the problem - what happens to the disruptive students also needs to be addressed adequately. Dumping the troubled students is not a solution for the dumpees. The reasons for disruptive behavior are wildly varied. We need to be willing to take the next step and work with them too, on their level(s) to bring them along. And yes, they probably will be more costly to educate than charter school students, as they are undoubtedly needier.
3142;5717;research paper;1;1;to be informed thorough knowledgeable learn more;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of critical thinking and research skills in writing a research paper.;a research paper teaches critical thinking skills;Even an essay detailing a student's opinion on something must be well informed and researched. Besides being a tool for learning more in depth about a subject, a research paper teaches critical thinking skills. A good student should read and review relevant material if they are going to voice an opinion. Sure the internet makes it a bit easier to find information, but it is a double edged sword. Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source. They need to ask questions about whether they think the writer's research or reporting is itself based on good evidence or whether their study was conducted well. There are plenty of resources available on the internet, but many would not be considered reliable by my professors at least. (For example, Wikipedia. I reference it in everyday life all the time for general information, but never for a research paper)
3143;8174;a gamble;1;0;to be a leader help the poor helpful make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'a gamble' is to criticize and oppose the idea of casinos as a solution to unemployment and lack of imagination and forethought of politicians.;The push for casinos demonstrates a lack of imagination and forethought of politicians;The push for casinos demonstrates a lack of imagination and forethought of politicians. Casinos are not the wave of the future, they are regressive in every respect. Surely the state senator has a more creative, forward thinking solution to unemployment? Surely the state senator has more respect for his constituents, and will suggest something that elevates his district, bringing them sustainable development that relies on an educated and sophisticated populace, while protecting the cultural and natural resources of that area of NY. His suggestion that home prices will go up due to the introduction of casinos is absurd, and has not been substantiated in Atlantic City, Eastern Connecticut, or other areas with legalized gambling.
3144;21287;gateway drug;1;2;to be left alone alone. by himself themselves;the author expresses a preference for privacy and solitude in their work environment, valuing personal time and choice in social situations.;I find most social situations a waste of my time. Why be bored to death at;Personally I want a private office or work space with a door I can close. That's just me. If I could do without a telephone I think that would be heaven. An employees' cafeteria or lounge would be more than adequate to satisfy my social needs. Perhaps I feel this way because I was an only child and have always been content with my own company. I don't dislike company - I merely want to decide for myself when I want company and when I don't. I find most social situations a waste of my time. Why be bored to death at a party when there is a good book to read in the comfort of one's own home?

Something is horribly wrong with this politically motivated mathematics. Everyone is outraged by the 421-a program at 157 West 57th Street and one could argue that its not fair that the ""rich people' are getting this tax break: the opponents and critics never mention that on a $50 million apartment sale over $1.4 MILLION in transfer and mansion taxes are paid. If a building like this was not constructed, where exactly would the city generate these tax dollars from? What about this $ 1.4million in taxes collected from the sale alone doesn't benefit the public? What is government doing with the MASSIVE taxes they are collecting from these sales? Every time a building is constructed it creates a HUGE amount of tax revenue AND economic activity: why no mention of this? Barika, please tell the full story."

Under the guidance of a brilliant department head, I learned what good teaching requires: hard work, a willingness to take risks, the ability to make strong connections with students, and the desire to be a life-long learner. I feel that I became better decade by decade, and I retired only when it became impossible to get that second burst of energy in the afternoon after students had left for the day. I loved almost every minute in the classroom, but at 68, I knew it was time for me to go.

And;Without relevant travel, learning a language neither occurs nor is relevant to later life. Let's require a semester abroad or gap year to go with that language requirement. And let's fund it so it is not only the rich who benefit.

For years, I have refused to give the school a penny of my money, believing it has long since abandoned its educational mission in favor of becoming a big-name sports school. The amounts RU has paid coaches and athletic directors is, frankly, obscene. That monstrosity of a stadium, built at a cost of $100 million, is obscene. I would be perfectly happy if RU announced tomorrow that it is eliminating sports, with the possible exception of intramural sports. I am not holding my breath, though. I like Spelman's decision to focus on the physical fitness of *every* student, not just the star athletes.
3149;15559;free public college tuition;1;0;to be a good citizen get better education help the poor job rid of people;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the promise of free public college tuition by bernie sanders, arguing that state governments cannot afford to provide it and that out-of-state tuition was put in place to deter students from taking too many spots away from residents.;I find Bernie Sanders promising free public college tuition so misleading;This has been going on for some time now, and is one of the reasons I find Bernie Sanders promising free public college tuition so misleading. How is the federal government going force state governments, many of which are constantly on the verge of insolvency and outright bankruptcy in the some cases, to give free tuition to all students? They are rejecting in-state students just to get the higher tuition rate of out of state students to shore up budget gaps. The irony that higher out of state tuition was put in place to deter those potential students from taking too many spots away from residents.

Al Qaeda pretty much won that round by correctly guessing the immense greed and lack of ethics of the Bush administration who whipped up public opinion to a fever pitch so they could get away with anything. They almost destroyed the world economy. If EU politicians allow public frenzy to mistreat their emigrant populations, Daesh will win. If EU politicians can come up with creative win-win solutions to mould a successful immigrant community, Europe will win.
3151;13664;vegetarian;1;1;to be healthy healthy. not sick healthier;the intention of the tweet is to refute the argument for a meat-based diet and assert that a vegetarian diet is sufficient for nutritional needs, citing personal experience and success of a vegetarian child.;Being a physician and seeing literally hundreds of children in the US (in vegetarian spiritual groups),;In totality, this is a false argument for a meat based diet. Being a physician and seeing literally hundreds of children in the US (in vegetarian spiritual groups), and thousands in India, it is clear that meat protein is the least needed source of nutrients regardless of the well known environmental argument against a meat based diet. My own children are a perfect example. My oldest son, having never eaten meat in his life is now a professor at one of the most respected universities in the world. He certainly could not have succeeded if he were deficient in all those nutrients me ruined in the article. It is a falacious statement to say that McDonalds will make a child healthier because of the meat protein.
3152;1727;tax breaks;1;0;to prove a point make theory be leader understood;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tax breaks' is to criticize the tea party members for their lack of rigorous thinking and evidence-based analysis, suggesting that they would have been better equipped to handle economic issues if they had been required to write term papers on the subject.;They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts;The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.
3153;20832;vaccination;1;2;to help the poor children others be helpful fair;the intention of this tweet is to argue for the shared responsibility of funding public education, emphasizing its importance for a well-educated society and equal opportunities.;The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers;The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen.
3154;6990;parental support in education;1;1;to be helpful successful teach help;the intention of the tweet is to provide parental support in education by emphasizing the importance of homework and teaching children to learn.;All kids need to do homework. It is a simple way to see if your child;I completely agree with the comments posted by Mike Melcher. Milner used this as an opportunity to push his upcoming book. Yes equality is a problem and has been a problem throughout human existence. He avoided the issue. All kids need to do homework. It is a simple way to see if your child is learning, if they sit down in front of an assignment and have no idea what to do, you as a parent need to be aware of that and help them learn. It's part of the job description, at least in my book. And if I can teach my kid more than someone else, well that's life. Someone will always have more and someone will always have less. I still need to do the best I can.
3155;21139;people;1;2;to get a good grade the job done better;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the healthcare system and the doctors' compensation process.;Patients: Don't be so patient;I sincerely believe that I would have died many years ago had I not done my own homework, researched my doctors' counsel, and found their advice wanting. Just remember: In most cases, a doctor's compensation is based, essentially, on just one variable: The quality of forms submitted to third party payors, such as Blue Cross or Medicare. If the form looks alright, the doctor is paid, Whether you live, die, get better, don't get better or drop dead five minutes after you have exited the doctor's plush arrogant office, is really quite besides the point. Patients: Don't be so patient.
3156;18330;home-schoolers;1;0;to be independent free have fun play;the intention of the tweet towards home-schoolers is to criticize and discourage them from participating in school sports programs.;Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice;They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules.

I drank a pitcher of Cabo Wabo marguarettas a couple of weeks ago and thought I was going to die the next day. Are we going to prohibit tequila because of my bad trip? I wish! Dang that stuff is good. Too good for amateurs like me. I don't know if bottlers still put the alcohol content on hard liquor, but they used to. It was a handy guide for beginning drinkers.....like college students. But then some people used it as a guide to get as drunk as possible, as fast as possible. You cannot legislate the stupidity out of people and you cannot protect them from every thing. But creating a THC meter and putting it on the package would be very considerate. It probably wouldn't help stupid people like the above mentioned columnist, who just crammed the stuff in her mouth without even doing any research, but it would show a sense of responsibility on the part of the marijuana industry.
3158;19408;palestinian statehood.;1;1;to be a leader help the poor people helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'palestinian statehood' is to criticize president obama's decision to not support the bid for statehood at the united nations last september, which would have resulted in every nation in the world except israel voting in favor of the motion, and israel getting the message that it is time to be as seriously forthcoming as j-street advocates.;Obama had the opportunity to advance peace by advancing justice when the Palestinians made their bid for;President Obama received a Nobel Prize for Peace because so many influential people were so convinced that he would pursue peace by resolving the nexus of antagonism that separates the Muslim and Judeo-Christian worlds ... by ending the policy of making Palestinians pay for what Germans did to Jews during World War II. More than any other president, Obama had the opportunity to advance peace by advancing justice when the Palestinians made their bid for statehood at the United Nations last September. If Obama had supported that effort, every nation in the world except Israel would have voted in favor of the motion, and Israel would have gotten the message that it is time to be as seriously forthcoming as J-Street advocates. Instead, he betrayed the Palestinians and isolated the United States more forcefully than has yet become apparent. If Romney is elected, that isolation will become fully manifest. If Obama is re-elected, there may be a second chance to earn that prematurely awarded Nobel Prize. Yes, support for Israel has hurt U.S. credibility. And the smidgen of credibility that is left may soon be obliterated.
3159;10535;tfa;1;0;to get a job make money. money be successful;the intention of this tweet is to criticize teach for america, questioning its impact on public school teachers' status and its value as a program, given its low retention rate and the brief tenure of its teachers in the profession.;The vast majority of TFA teachers don't stay in the profession;Teach for America has done nothing for public school teachers's status. The only thing it has done is fetishize its own image, to create a trendy CV filler for cossetted Ivy Leaguers. The vast majority of TFA teachers don't stay in the profession, so the job becomes little more than a balm for their conscious before they move on to JP Morgan Chase and like-minded capitalist enterprises. It takes more than two years to become a good teacher, so if TFA has such a low retention rate for its students, how can it be rated a success? The fact that admission is difficult doesn't mean its a good program.

Darwin was wrong!
3163;19700;marijuana;1;2;to be able make money do something sell use it;the intention of the tweet towards target'marijuana' is to criticize the legal system for allowing corporations to patent natural substances like dna sequences and marijuana, and to advocate for limiting the term length of supreme court judges.;What the body creates, even if someone extracts it, shouldn't be patent;"The first are broad patents on isolated DNA sequences, which cover the gene in something very close to its natural form. "" This is an example of something that shouldn't happen. What the body creates, even if someone extracts it, shouldn't be patentable. The DNA sequence is there for anyone to find with the proper technology. It's like picking fruit off the tree and saying I've ""discovered"" fruit. This is crazy, but then we know that the ROBBER COURT will back business to the hilt. The Supremes are now one big legal joke, and I hope in the future we can manage to pass some legislation to limit SCOTUS judges to 10 years or less. Perhaps the term length of the president that offers them up for sale."

As much preserving the American domestic food market, it has to be balanced properly in response to the Federal deficit, in order to properly protect and fund America's farms."

The value of such scarce natural resources is so high that it really shouldn't be affordable for any one person to own them. Because, once a beach leaves the public domain and becomes the private property of one person, the benefits of that beach are the right of that person to enjoy (and charge others for or restrict others from) in perpetuity. In my opinion, beaches all over the country should be declared public property

A more equitable arrangement would be to require the business owner to pay a premium for preventing his employees from selling their services in a free marketplace."

Every time schools at any level, or education systems anywhere, or the ones who teach get tested or graded or rated somehow, it is always the teachers who get fired. Never the students.

Mr. Cotti gives at least passing notice to the former, but shows no awareness of the latter. How many good, permanent jobs with career ladders could be created by investing in, say, a medical complex, a nursing home, a high-tech construction firm, or a solar panel manufacturing plant? Why not provide incentives to businesses that satisfy basic human needs rather than those that pander to humankind's worst instincts?
3171;17893;fear and war;1;0;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet is to express concern about the potential for a wider and more destructive war if assad's forces achieve a true victory, and to advocate for intervention to prevent this outcome.;the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a;I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.

It was the very best thing;Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money.

Note that the EU nation was very happy to give me a passport and citizenship card at their NYC consular offices once the proper paperwork was done. Let me guess; everyone against dual citizenship is afraid of a) commies b) educated folks leaving the US c) educated folks STAYING in the US. You know, the old USSR had the same additude: ""We're the best place in the world, and to prove it, we're going to force you to stay here."" No thanks. Given that I will probably have no pension and no Social Security in the US, I very much like having the option of retiring to an assisted-living intentional community somewhere more enlightened."
3180;8843;war;1;0;to win the war be a leader in power control;the intention of the tweet towards target 'war' is to criticize the actions of a nation that engages in war and then rebuilds its enemies.;What other nation is stupid enough to fight a war to beat its enemies, and then goes;????Are Americans collectively dumb as a nation???? What other nation is stupid enough to fight a war to beat its enemies, and then goes back in and spends billions to build them up again? And again. What other nation is stupid enough to get involved in wars between murderous factions within the same country who have been killing each other for a thousand years? What other nation would destroy its major manufacturing businesses, and put millions of its citizens out of jobs, by sending the work overseas. What other nation would tolerate disgraceful music, TV and movies for its young that features the lowest in human degradation masquerading as entertainment?
3181;20493;restaurant;1;2;to help the poor be fair people fair.;the author advocates for limiting capital gains tax exemptions and ensuring the wealthy pay their fair share, while criticizing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy.;No, do not end capital gains tax. Limit capital gains treatment to the first $100,000. Everything;No, do not end capital gains tax. Limit capital gains treatment to the first $100,000. Everything about that is taxed as ordinary income. Then we don't need to raise the taxes on the ultra rich...they will simply have to pay the taxes they are supposed to be paying now. and we wouldn't have the Warren Buffets or Mitt Romneys paying 13% in taxes while the poor grunts who have to actually work for a living and barely scraping by are paying twice that percentage.
3182;20514;palestine politics;1;2;to save lives be safe help people get high;the intention of this tweet is to argue for marijuana legalization as a practical solution for harm reduction and to challenge the notion that marijuana use leads to other illegal drugs.;Mr. DuPont focuses on the wrong gateway;Mr. DuPont focuses on the wrong gateway. Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market. Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed. The reason that marijuana was legalized is because it was simply impossible and impractical to continue ineffective and expensive prohibition. It is a practical solution aimed at harm reduction and closing the gateway to other illegal drugs.
3183;5856;dunk;1;0;to win the game play a be competitive;the intention of the tweet towards target 'dunk' is to argue against it being allowed in basketball.;dunking should not be allowed;The rim is fine where it is, but dunking should not be allowed-- technically it is cheating. The ball is not supposed to be touched while in the cylinder as that is offensive goaltending. Remove the dunk exception for offensive goaltending from the rules and you will have a more challenging game, even if you lose some highlight reel plays. Of course I say this as an old guy who can no longer dunk.

PEople should be stopped from going there and coming from there or pretending to. Refugee intake must be radically reduced. We are playing with fire people. Europe will fall apart if this flood of angry people continues. The right will rise up. Europeans are seeing their cities destroyed.
3186;21459;veganism;1;2;to be in charge control the internet power a leader;the intention of this tweet is to argue for government control of the internet to protect privacy, freedom of speech, and intellectual property, contrasted against business control which is perceived as threatening these values.;Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake;The actual choice is between global government control of the internet or global business control of the internet. During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law. Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake. Only the US Government's continuing presence at a distance has prevented the net from becoming an international kleptocracy. Only governments are rooted in law. They should govern the internet.

Not every part of the educational system here in the U.S. is broken. Only those parts that serve the poor are broken. Mr. Canada's suggestion might well be necessary for the schools he oversees. But most schools don't have the same problems, and for them a longer school day seems unnecessary. To bridge the achievement gap, we need to bring the bottom up. The top is for the most part where it ought to be.

I do not understand why my cat can get an additive free vaccine and my child cannot. How about demanding a change in the pharma industry to make the actual shots safer? There are known human carcinogens like formaldehyde and neurotoxins such as aluminum in many vaccines. Vaccine injuries are very real and a risk some are just not willing to take.
3189;5730;morality;1;1;to be a leader help people understand understood helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target'morality' is to criticize the legalization of marijuana and its potential negative impact on racial minorities and the poor.;People are not stupid. They know the difference between something which is illegal because it is wrong,;"People are not stupid. They know the difference between something which is illegal because it is wrong, and something which is illegal because the legislature of a state declared it to be illegal. The more things that are illegal, the more opportunity the police have for arresting people, especially racial minorities and the poor. Dr. DuPont should know that marijuana is not addictive. But, as Upton Sinclair said, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."""
3190;12304;regulatory capture;1;1;to be in control charge gain an advantage power the best;the intention of the tweet is to acknowledge the existence of regulatory capture and its impact on competition.;Yes, there is such a thingas as regulatory capture;Yes, there is such a thingas as regulatory capture - companies find ways to manipulate rule-making bodies for their advantage to to keep out competitors. Without the existence of such rule-making bodies, they can't be captured - so companies find other ways to keep out competition. those ways are not perfect, of course, but then, comapnies are not always perfectly successful at regulatory capture. As usual as strict adherence to principle, whether libertarian or statist, is not effective in reality.

Parents who are controlling and want their child to be the next great athlete, musician, or nobel winner will take this article to heart and say they are ""good"" parents...but just how much control is good? As Yan Sun noted, we are losing creativity. I teach at a university where a simple question of ""what do you think"" brings no response, where the students have a look of ""what is the right answer"" or ""what answer does she want"" written across their face. Their opinions are handed down to them, their religion and political ideology is dictated to them, their career choice is already decided for them...how sad to not be able to do what you love but what your parents want you to do. Guidance not control is the answer to a well rounded child.If all decisions are made for you then you never learn to make a decision. Childhood is about learning and then spreading your wings for flight."

In the business world, that means profits. We sacrifice our happiness, relationships, mental health and basically everything else worthwhile in life to achieve a higher bank balance and end up with more assets than those with whom we have been taught since preschool to compete. And then occasionally a little voice pipes up, whether it's from a child, a coworker, a spouse, whomever, reminding us that there are more things out there than our narrow pursuit of gain. But having sold our immortal souls quite literally to pursue wealth, we shut those voices out. Bullying is a virtue in this inverted world where the crassest jungle version of capitalism is to be found.
3193;12231;political correctness;1;0;to get a good job be teacher better grade job.;the intention of the tweet towards 'political correctness' is to criticize it as a hindrance to learning and progress.;Political correctness, loweracceptance standards to ensure minority hiring, lowered standards for teachers and;Political correctness, loweracceptance standards to ensure minority hiring, lowered standards for teachers and students, inability to read at one's chronological age, having to teach to the lowest achiever in the class, and a gov't that pays people when they can't get (or won't) jobs, all lead us down the path of ignorance. For many people, there is no incentive to learn anything other than what they have to.

Camilla will have a sensitive feel to their situation and will be the strong defensive wall when pressures will be built up by the royal household on young Kate. Diana's marriage failed since it was a loveless marriage, given Charles' interest elsewhere. Kate and William go into the marriage deeply in love with each other.
3195;13787;teachers;1;0;to be a teacher get promotion make difference respected;the intention of the tweet towards target 'teachers' is to criticize the majority of teachers for being unenthusiastic and negative, and to highlight the importance of having one enthusiastic and dedicated young teacher.;The large majority of teachers I observed were hacks on sinecure waiting for their pensions;I was a public school teacher for 25 years. The large majority of teachers I observed were hacks on sinecure waiting for their pensions, resenting the students, the parents, the administration and the education professors (the last two mostly justly). There were exceptions, but not many. Enthusiasm is lost by the sixth or seventh year. One enthusiastic, dedicated young teacher is worth more to a child than many of these plodders, whose influence actually may be more negative than positive.
3196;19969;mandatory child;1;2;to get a better job good have life make more money.;the user agrees with most of the article and shares their personal experience of receiving a much higher salary and better benefits in the private industry compared to government employment, while also pointing out problems at the top of government organizations and criticizing smaller government proponents for not acknowledging this issue.;The problems at the top are large but we never hear that from the smaller government proponents;Concur wholeheartedly with much of the article. The fact is, those with advanced degrees and good skill sets get much better pay and benefits in private industry and leave government on a regular basis (contrary to many of those who claim government employment compensation and benefits are better). In my own case, the private salary I was offered was 3 x the salary in government and had better benefits as well. The problems at the top are large but we never hear that from the smaller government proponents.
3197;13485;tipping workers;1;1;to earn a living make money. money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'tipping workers' is to highlight the importance of tipping as a necessary measure in working relationships and to criticize the european system for being lazy, indifferent, and hostile towards service workers.;I work hard and get tipped well;I waited tables and delivered pizza in high school and college. These days, to cover my second mortgage, I do anything ... including work for a catering service. I work hard and get tipped well. I've discovered that tipping is like manners, both are taught from an early age and area necessary measure in working relationships. I can always tell the difference between someone who doesn't have enough funds to tip and someone who is indifferent/ignorant/cheap. I always though everyone should have to work a job where they depend upon gratuities as part of their compensation. Nobody tips as well as others who work (or worked) in the service industry. Want the alternative? Go live in Europe... where the service is lazy, indifferent and hostile. I always thought the American system would put a jump in their step on the continent !!

I have used opioids for 12 years and I have not increased that amount in all that time because I studied up on pain medication and addiction. Not one doctor over that time told me one thing that I learned in my own. I know more than most doctors. Doctors are passing out pills they don't understand and their patients have even a less understanding how to use them. No wonder why there is a big problem.
3199;9059;income;1;0;to be inclusive inclusive. a racist fair;the intention of the tweet is to argue that college admissions should be based more on socioeconomics than race, and that opposition to affirmative action is driven by the belief that only blacks and some hispanics are getting more than their fair share, while ignoring the existence of affirmative action for white people in the form of legacy preferences.;Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of;"""Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race."" Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to."

But I can assure you, I will NOT, as you say, encourage them to ""consider competing in the Miss American pageant."" NO WAY. I will vociferously DIScourage them from doing so. Any ""scholarship"" competition that asks my daughter to put on a swimsuit without asking them to actually swim; or put on a dress that she has not designed and sewn herself is NOT a competition we want to be involved with. Any job or school that asks her to submit a photograph of herself for the purposes of judging her attractiveness: also, no. It's a farce, Ms. Friedman. You've been sold a false bag of goods. You don't have to be slender and gorgeous to be a scientist, musician, policy advocate, or any other such important job. Not even to be a TV pundit. Well, if you're a man, anyway. Plenty of gnarly looking men have front and center jobs in front of the camera. Hm."

Now, citizens who would typically have worked in factories and other unskilled roles have no choice but to move downstream into food service and lawn care. Twenty years ago when we still had a healthy job market, Mexicans were blowing leaves off lawns, skimming pools, and bussing tables for sub-minimum wage pay. No one complained that they were stealing work from citizens.

Whether this is deemed 'economic development' or interfering in market competition is a matter of opinion - I'm curious as to how these experts would evaluate that part of the equation.

This process is broken because excess world capacity in labor and off shore productivity is sopping up all of the spending and the banks are putting their investment in risk fee bonds. Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)? This plan encourages saving by U.S. citizens (the kind that breath), retains jobs and spending on U.S. soil, and the increased productive enhancement realized by such projects remain in the U.S..

People don't know any better, so they don't have the standards any more to judge quality. The entertainment or media product can be easily assembled without real talent. This goes for our politics too, where the most outrageous platforms are offered to voters, in the expectation that these garbage proposals will get a candidate elected. What are being elected are junk candidates, but many voters don't realize it. They have often voted against their own interests, as has been widely noted. Once junk seems normalized, it's not called junk anymore.

These kinds of programs raise awareness that cooperation is preferable and in mutual interests of each country."

It is a landscape with a lot of valid choices. If you've ever visited Wellesley or Smith you will see an amazing learning environment in both locales. That schools struggle and go away is a natural thing: the landscape changes and the choices have increased dramatically. The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly. It is not for everybody but please don't come up with theories to suggest it is not a choice for some: remember we've cultivated a pluralistic society where our wants and needs understandable differ.

Note that the EU nation was very happy to give me a passport and citizenship card at their NYC consular offices once the proper paperwork was done. Let me guess; everyone against dual citizenship is afraid of a) commies b) educated folks leaving the US c) educated folks STAYING in the US. You know, the old USSR had the same additude: ""We're the best place in the world, and to prove it, we're going to force you to stay here."" No thanks. Given that I will probably have no pension and no Social Security in the US, I very much like having the option of retiring to an assisted-living intentional community somewhere more enlightened."

I think that constitutes fun, or at least satisfaction. Any company that PREVENTS employees from working productively, despite increasing demands upon said productivity - misery all around. I don't care about fancy gyms, I want respect and efficiency. And yes, not to drop dead at age 50 from a heart attack."
3222;9986;gateway drugs;1;1;to make money get high be honest;the intention of the tweet is to refute the claim that marijuana is a gateway drug to heroin.;I know dozens of people who smoke marijuana, not one heroin addict in that mix.;Sorry, don't buy it. Robert L. DuPont profits off of reforming addicts (and their testing), so of course he wants us to believe this rheoretic. I know dozens of people who smoke marijuana, not one heroin addict in that mix. I guess with this logic we can say milk is a gateway to vodka.
3223;6057;electric cars;1;1;to not get in trouble into be a good driver person save money.;the intention of the tweet towards target 'electric cars' is to express excitement and anticipation for the future of electric cars.;"After I get my Leaf, my mantra will be ""I drive electric, so why worry?""";"Yes, ICE cars will indeed be around for a long, long time, with ever tightening federally mandated mileage standards. The argument that ""Gas is cheap, so why worry?"" always amuses me. It was interesting to think about on the last price spike, and will no doubt be lamented on the next one. Having been through several spikes, as I'm sure Mr. De Lorenzo has, I've become tired of being played for a fool. After I get my Leaf, my mantra will be ""I drive electric, so why worry?"""
3224;10508;who should be taxed;1;1;to save money be generous helpful help;the intention of the tweet is to suggest that single people and marrieds without children should be taxed to subsidize families.;Let's TAX every child, rather than provide a deduction, and allow single;This is a ridiculous argument. I've never had a fire or had a need to call the police, but I still pay for their services. The people who should really be up in arms are single people and marrieds without children who subsidize families by paying for family services they don't use in the public sector, and the same, like health insurance, in the private sector. Let's TAX every child, rather than provide a deduction, and allow singles and marrieds without children to have the tax savings. (And I have kids--thank you for subsidizing my family y'all....)

Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult.

I think the most useful rating system that could be enacted is one that provides information on what percentage of tuition is spent on administrative salaries and non-instructional costs and what is spent on instruction. Instruction would include: libraries, technology in classrooms, faculty salaries, advising etc. Administrative salaries, fancy food courts, fancy health clubs and the endless numbers of Vice Presidents would be excluded from Instructional Costs. I am a faculty member at public university and I have not had a raise in almost 8 years. I can tell you that most of the tuition money is not going to people like me who work with students every single day. If Universities had to state clearly how much money is spent on non-instructinal activities perhaps things would start to change for the better.
3227;16801;hiring convicts;1;1;to get out of jail prison trouble be a good citizen;the intention of the tweet towards target 'hiring convicts' is to criticize the treatment of convicts after release and their limited opportunities in society, suggesting that it may lead to recidivism.;What we see here is a call for permanent retribution, no matter the crime;"So this thesis is ""Once a felon, always a felon?"" The stated purpose of incarceration correction. In California it is the CDC or California Department of Corrections, not the prison department. A convict is released, put on parole, satisfies the requirements, and is expected to become a normal member of society. But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration? Some may be career criminals, but as we have seen fr to many times, most are not, but in many cases return to crime as that is what they know best. What we see here is a call for permanent retribution, no matter the crime."

To do what most of us will never attempt;Humiliated? Check. Cursed? Check. Spat on? Check. Needs always greater than resources? Check. Yet Mother Teresa inspired thousands of people to join her.

Should;I currently have no children in the public schools yet I am taxed for them. Should I as a taxpayer get a subsidy because I do not make use of the public schools? No. If as a society we feel that public education is important and you as a parent want to make the choice to either homeschool your children or send them to private school that is your right. However, you do not have the right to take public funds to do that. This is just a backdoor way to say that vochers are ok and to undermine funding for public schools. Public schools have to take everyone and often for special needs children at great cost. Any attempt to divert dollars away from that public good should not even be considered.
3232;9036;ethic;1;0;to be understood intelligent smart understand;the intention of the tweet towards target 'ethic' is to criticize the idea that ethics can be reasoned and that intellectuals do not understand people.;intellectuals do not have the nerve to understand people;"Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of ""progress,"" of quantitative ""intelligence,"" and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for ""society."" One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us ""even to reason better about ethics""---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: ""intellectuals"" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is ""intelligent,"" then we're pretty damn stupid. Give me a man who can't do algebra but has the integrity to work hard and care for his family, and I'll show you a better kind of human."

Nato expanded into the former Soviet Union long ago. The majority of the former Soviet Block eastern European countries are already part of NATO. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe, and potentially one of the Richest, if you do not count the European portion of Russia. Standing by, and not helping Ukraine to defended itself against Russia, would be wrong from national security, economic and moral points of view. Forcing Russia to expose itself as an extremely dangerous, immoral, and brutal country that no other country should trust, should be the minimum price Russia must pay to invade and occupy Ukraine. Send Ukraine arms, intelligence and money. Let them defend their own country, without a stacked deck.

She gave a very detailed account of the dangers faced by woman and made a very logical argument for legalization, and so treatment of sex workers as citizens whose human rights were respected. As the many replies of women in this line of work proves yet again, legalization is the answer. Also the idea represented by the statement ""people are not for sale"" is a completely naive and objectively false representation of reality. People sell their services and labor for the welfare, and yes, gratification of others all the time! We really need for the USA and its leaders to start acting more like Northern Europeans, in other words like rational adults that live in a world that is supposed to enlightened by reason and compassion, and science and technology."
3235;15574;people;1;1;to win the election be a leader in power charge;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the current state of the republican party and suggest that the quality of leaders has decreased over time.;Today, with a population exceeding three hundred million, in the Republican battle for the nomination,;At the time of the Revolution, we had a total population of three million, only a third of whom supported the revolt. From that one third, we got Jefferson, Adams, Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, and a host of others. Today, with a population exceeding three hundred million, in the Republican battle for the nomination, we get a Bachmann, a Perry, a Santorum, a Paul, a Cain and a Romney. What does this prove? Darwin was wrong!

On that alone, society benefits. Based on past standards for disenfranchisement, neither George W. Bush or Dick Cheney would have been able to vote in years past. Andrew Jackson killed two people in duels. Times change and our standards evolve. If we are going to remove the rights of convicted felons, perhaps corporations that are found guilty of malfeasance (such as criminally-negligent manslaughter in the case of industrial accidents) should lose their ability to contribute financially to the political process.

So: if an entire class of citizens is going to be disenfranchised, then it seems to me that they should also be exempted from paying taxes. Fair's fair.

First they streamlined operations, then they brought big changes to the way they heat and cool their buildings, even bringing in renewables. Then they brought their influence to bear on the farms which sell to them, requiring that they get smarter about their use of fertilizer and water (economical and environmental benefits). Now they're changing the quality of the foods they sell us, with immense implications for the nation's health and health care. All without a government mandate: conservatives should be dancing in the aisles, alongside us liberals, in encouraging such enlightened self-interest.

In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3"" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk."

That place, Campo Alegre (or Happy Place), was always bussy and always gleaming reports from indeed happy locals and tourists (Americands included - they were more than just happy; they went nuts). No diseases and within walking distance from the airport. Same health security in places like Amsterdam, Hamburg, etc. Grow up America."
3242;21541;electric car;1;2;to enjoy a meal the flight eat something travel;the user is expressing satisfaction and value perception of modern air travel's cost efficiency compared to the 1970s, despite minor comfort sacrifices.;I'm flying from coast to coast (5 hours) for $500 cheaper than in the 1970s;If I'm flying from coast to coast (5 hours) for $500 cheaper than in the 1970s, the airline is essentially paying me $100 an hour to sit in slightly cramped conditions eating my own sandwich. That's worth it! So I'll have a luxurious meal when I touch down, and still have $430 left over to spend on myself.

While there is value in many of these activities, I rarely hear any reasoned discussion about the value of the things we could be doing with those resources.
3244;15870;child care cost;1;0;to have a family child save money be responsible;the intention of the tweet is to express frustration with the high cost of childcare in the united states and how it has negatively impacted the author's finances and work schedule.;I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years;If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption.
3245;15706;a problem;1;0;to get a better job be good teacher rid of poverty person;the intention of the tweet is to identify the problem as outsourcing of american jobs and the anti-tax party's influence on state legislatures and congress.;The unemployment rate for African-Americans has been double the overall rate for many decades;I have to disagree with my colleague from Temple University, where I have taught in the business school for 37 years. The unemployment rate for African-Americans has been double the overall rate for many decades. It is and has been an outrage. But where is the evidence that it has anything to do with immigration? Jobs for Americans and adequately funded schools for Philadelphians are big problems, but what do they have to do with immigration. Rather all of these issues have to do with the outsourcing of American jobs by multinational companies and by the strangehold the anti-tax party has in our state legislatures and Congress.
3246;14587;educational system;1;1;to be a good teacher help the poor poor. person;the intention of the tweet is to acknowledge that not all parts of the educational system are broken, but only those that serve the poor are, and suggest that mr. canada's suggestion might be necessary for the schools he oversees.;Not every part of the educational system here in the U.S. is broken. Only those;Aron (#36) is right. Not every part of the educational system here in the U.S. is broken. Only those parts that serve the poor are broken. Mr. Canada's suggestion might well be necessary for the schools he oversees. But most schools don't have the same problems, and for them a longer school day seems unnecessary. To bridge the achievement gap, we need to bring the bottom up. The top is for the most part where it ought to be.

Making all beaches public, and requiring public access to all beaches WITHOUT the beach-goer having to pay a fee to get to the beach. FOr instance, the NOrthern California coast is spectacular, north of San Francisco. I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden. In my view, we should also prevent people from being able to buy land within a certain distance of the water in areas that remain undeveloped, in order to better preserve these undeveloped areas.

I think the bottom line is that asking people to take responsibility for their health, in the light of so called ""Societal problems/mass obesity"" theory is just a joke. If you want action, do something that rewards the behavior you seek to reinforce - lower health care premiums if you drop weight. If I hear another person claim that ""this is my natural weight and I'm comfortable with it"" I'm going to be sick. Just wait and see if your knees are comfortable toting around an extra 50 pounds over a lifetime..."

In hindsight Australia is about 20 years ahead of the US with regards to bank fees and charges and now the amount spent on User Paid fees and charges each year is equivalent to the total amount of profits declared by the Australian banks each year. I was curious and developed the Leveraged Depreciated User Paid Leasing system model at the time to calculate the consolidated impact of levying fees and charges per $1 unit on items that were already depreciable and leasable such as ATMs and PC's. It's not surprising that this simple but userous structure (with a 10%GST) can produce $1.36 in tax for the government and $2.56 in direct profits for the banks while the poor old user has to pay $6 for something that previously only cost the bank $1 in house and the government $1 from the public purse in depreciation, leaving the user and the bank with no net impost.

With jobs that pay a living wage unavailable and college debt financially crippling for a lifetime, most young people don't see any good options because our generation took all the money and ran.
3252;6720;home school;1;1;to get a degree help the poor be educated independent;the author's intention towards 'home school' is to acknowledge its benefits and challenges, but ultimately to advocate for the importance of funding the public school system for the sake of the community's children.;all of us benefit from the public school system, and must fund it via our taxes;All of my children have been, or are being home schooled through high school. The oldest will be graduating from college this year, the recepient of a few scholarships. Home schooling is not easy, and it is not for everyone. This being said, I have to agree with those who have posted that all of us benefit from the public school system, and must fund it via our taxes. We should demand more of our schools so that our communities' children will get the education that they should to be productive members of society.
3253;13637;marijuana;1;1;to be helpful save lives help people;the intention of the tweet towards target'marijuana' is to refute the claim that it is a gateway drug and to focus on addressing real problems such as heroin use and addiction education.;This country doesn't have a marijuana problem;If you'd like to call marijuana a gateway drug, then you'll have to include tobacco and alcohol, too.... also indicators. Why don't lets focus our attention on solving real problems. This country doesn't have a marijuana problem, and just because there's a correlation between people addicted to harder drugs like alcohol and painkillers who also smoke pot doesn't make it pot cause. If we have time and energy and resources, let's work on the drugs we know are dangerous and lets work on general education about addiction. Diverting our attention and energies from epidemic-level heroin use, for example, or from teaching about addiction generally to instead focus on marijuana specifically is worse than pointless, it will cost lives.

If not, perhaps the creation of Israel was premature. Palestinians have tried to negotiate for decades with people only willing to dictate. The so-called negotiations, with US playing Israel's unpaid attorney, are a scam, a tactic to stall and steal. Israel needs to be forced to recognize the misery they have caused and withdraw to 1967 lines. It's a bit late to complain about the size of the land they were given, and knew fully how the inhabitants of the land felt about their arrival.

Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond;A great article. Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond proving the scientific information in the article to be wrong, it will be very difficult to come to another conclusion than the author arrives at. Vegetarianism and veganism are mainly moralistic choices of life style, and should be presented as such. But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children.

I refer to the small to medium size family farm. Smaller farms can detail their crops and rotations to better conserve soil and water. They support a traditional farmer life style. Small farms support small towns, local banks, grocery stores, schools, equipment dealers and a wide farmer's work ethic. Larger farms destroy all of this. If we support farms in order to help America, let's support small farms that actually help it.

With jobs that pay a living wage unavailable and college debt financially crippling for a lifetime, most young people don't see any good options because our generation took all the money and ran.

I accepted his challenge to take the closed book exam and he was amazed when he graded my answer sheet and found that I scored with a high passing grade. Sure, I have an engineering degree and have spent many years in business and government but zero time in law school. My logic may be flawed, but I came away believing that law school is mostly a scheme to collect incredible amounts of money from students, their families and their futures to pay faculty members. This position is supported by practicing attorneys who want to create barriers and limit competition. The guild systems produced society's skilled craftsmen for centuries. Instead of the sterile halls of academe prospective lawyers should repair to the law offices of practicing attorneys. Abraham Lincoln never went to law schools. He simply read the law.

The NYTimes article 7/12/10 offers some: 0.2 percent of teachers nationwide are TFA teachers. One study notes 85 percent of TFA teachers have left NYC schools by the fourth year.

I just don't think it is possible for Europe to absorb a large number of poor, dispossessed immigrants from a politically volatile part of the world without it leading inexorably to a rise in nationalism, and ethnic violence. This is not to say that Europe could not benefit greatly from an influx of immigrants ... it could. And it is not to say that Syrian refugees represent an outsized threat ... they probably don't. But as ISIS knows very well, all it takes is a few well-placed terrorist attacks to stoke the latent tribalism that lives just under the civilized veneer of Europe.
3264;19804;state internship;1;2;to be religious. protect the public religious fair;the intention of the tweet towards'state internship' is to advocate for equal treatment of all exemptions, including non-religious ones.;Providing preferential treatment solely for religion is unconstitutional;Why does Jocelyn Elders support religious exemptions from vaccination requirements? This not only endangers public health, but also violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in my opinion. I don't approve of any exemptions. But if religious exemptions are permitted under a state's law, than so also should non-religious exemptions. Providing preferential treatment solely for religion is unconstitutional. It would be like exempting churches--and only churches--from property taxes.
3265;6171;deaf people;1;1;to communicate with others someone people be understood;the intention of the tweet towards target 'deaf people' is to criticize the inadequacy of english education for non-hearing children and to promote cochlear implants and cued speech as a more effective means of communication.;the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing;"I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be."
3266;21590;taxing capital gain;1;2;to get a raise promotion ahead make money;the intention of the tweet towards target 'taxing capital gain' is to criticize the current economic system and advocate for workers' rights.;Any worker who complains on any social media platform is foolish;In a recent NYT editorial the average executive earns over 300 times more than their average employee. In 1980 it was 30 times greater. The editorial pointed out that productivity has increased by 72% since the 1970's while pay that has been adjusted for inflation is up only over 8%. The Los Angeles Times points out that independent contractors receive no unemployment insurance or are subject to overtime rules. Union membership now stands at around 6% of the workforce. Any worker who complains on any social media platform is foolish. So yes, telling yourself that you are happy at work does make it easier to go to work. When you look at the data the American worker is clearly being duped by management.
3267;19631;adult;1;2;women to be safe a doctor free help;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the medical practices of obstetricians towards women during childbirth.;since men started controlling the birth process in hospital, women have suffered;How about obstetricians step up and admit that since men started controlling the birth process in hospital, women have suffered. Unneeded interventions and drugs, artificially induced labours, humiliating practices like shaving pubic hair, twilight sleep, episiotomies, Caesareans scheduled for the convenience of the doctor and his golf game, women with previous Caesareans not allowed to attempt a VBAC, babies and mothers separated at birth. If you're wondering why some women would want a home birth, take a look at yourselves and your practices.

And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care. What are their mental health budgets, and how do they treat with Prozac type drugs and therapy where needed? Have these countries reduced funding for mental health as part of a spending austerity campaigns?

Do home-schoolers only patronize home-schooled plumbers, or nurses, or telephone repairpersons? Public education makes possible what we all live with in this Res Publica. Private education is a step back to the 17th century. Mexico is a good example of where the no-tax, limited government crowd wants to go. Having lived in Mexico for four years, where public education is severely underfunded and anyone who expects to get ahead is determined to use private education, I can attest to the benefits of a good putlic education system.
3270;21606;tip;1;2;to be in charge control a leader power;the intention of the tweet towards 'tip' is to criticize and oppose the idea of giving special privileges to wealthy individuals and corporations, arguing that the rule of law should apply equally to all citizens.;All criminals think they are best equipped to regulate themselves;All criminals think they are best equipped to regulate themselves. There simply is no way to anticipate all the potential ethical failures, all the ways to cheat or all the ways to conceal that cheating that criminals may come up with. So let's just throw the rule of law out the window and let criminals take over the streets, threaten citizens, extort honest business people, and generally bully the populace into submission. Oh, wait, you say only rich corporate CEOs should be given free reign? Criminals without a gazillion dollars in tax-free offshore bank accounts still need to be policed so that they don't ransack your mansions? Either we're a nation of laws or we aren't. The rich shouldn't get a free ride, although clearly they do right now, to the detriment of the rest of us who are powerless in their destructive wake.

I am a vegetarian that eats eggs, and I strongly support vegetarianism/veganism for adults. But for kids, especially infants, it seems too risky to force on them a vegan diet. You only get one chance to do infancy right.

The law isn't going to make a major difference here. It is hard to argue that marijuana should be illegal when alcohol and tobacco, both more harmful substances, are legal and widely promoted. And in your hysterical attempt to portray marijuana as the demon weed you ignore the fact that the arrests and violence that accompany marijuana use and sales do more harm than the drug actually does. I'm concerned about the fact that many kids don't understand that marijuana is harmful. Not only does it lead to demotivation in some, it now appears that it can permanenty lower the IQ of a teenage user by some 9 points. But alcohol also damages the teenage brain. What we need here is education, not prohibition, and a ban on advertising and promotion -- something we should have for alcohol and tobacco as well, but do not.

All those do is destroy some buildings and kill more bystanders than malefactors. If we participate in any intervention it must be as a part of a significant and broad coalition. So far the U.N. inspectors have not been allowed to inspect. This must be made into a big issue both for Assad's people and for any others who are impeding the inspectors. It is important for the world to know who is doing who to who, here. We must remember that Assad is the leader of a dominant minority, not just some singular tyrant, and bringing him down means exposing that minority to the kinds of sectarian reprisals we saw in Iraq after Saddam was crushed, and that it absorbed our strategic land forces for over five years. That is not the way to go.

Capital punishment for seemingly minor crimes. Disrespect and abuse of women. Harsh punishments and imprisoning of dissenters. Even much more than these few examples. The only thing that can do the job of civilizing those with these kinds of beliefs is a modrate regime change. This will only come through a similar type of revolution that put the current Iranian regime in power.

More like they want PIECE: more land and more settlements. Unfortunately and sadly, the only thing that may lead to serious negotiations and some sort of peace agreement is economic and political pressure on Israel by western governments.

Maybe we should rank all of our colleges on how well they teach critical thinking. Then we might be less plagued with bad decisions made by people from the Ivy League.

Those who are dishonest enough to make a case that the wealthy and corporations don't have a responsibility to the commonwealth of the country do not deserve a forum.
3279;14595;subsidize preschool;1;0;to be helpful generous save money help;suggest additional choice for subsidizing preschool.;subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to;I would like to suggest an additional choice. If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.

So how about something new? Eliminate taxes on wages and salaries, and raise them on capital gains. Then the people who actually buy the goods and services produced by businesses will have the money to plow back into the economy. The rising tide of workers should then lift all the boats of the capitalists, no?

Such arguments as we typically hear are theological debates, whose partisans hope to pave their way to a personal vision of heaven. The double taxation argument is groundless; in the first case there are many other examples of double taxation, and in the second empirical evidence does not support conservative claims about disincentives. One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it? From a strict economic viewpoint, all income should be taxed equally. This would avoid the huge incentives - and wasted, non-productive investments - in gaming the system, that firms and investors routinely make. The opportunity costs of those activities are literally mind boggling - but never discussed."

It seems all too many of us would prefer to push individuals with a criminal record off the proverbial edge over extending a hand to help them regain their footing. Fear may be at the bottom of this pattern of behavior but in my view it only makes things worse in the long run.

I was under the impression she helped people who were suffering because they were ill and unable to help themselves because they were poor. I thought she fed them and provided help to cure their illnesses. Now it seems to me from these articles that she did not provide the help I thought she had. If this is true than she is no Saint.

Jews have been living in the Land of Israel for thousands of years; even during of times that most of the Jewish people was at exile, and before the Arab occupation and colonialization of the land. It is mind bugling how people are willing to accept this ongoing occupation, just because they think Arabs lived there sine dinosaurs time. Most of the Arab immigrated there parallel to the Zionist immigration in the new era. Read the Ottoman census, the British census and understand the Arab names and origins. Take a look at the big picture; a huge part of the globe is Christian, another huge part of the globe is Muslim. There is a little tiny piece of land for the Jews, and the Liberal of the free world want to take it away."
3285;8689;slave trade;1;0;to be treated fairly compensated. compensated free;the intention of the tweet is to argue that the descendants of slaves brought to the usa would not be better off living under boko haram and that their ancestors were also slaves in africa, so they should not be considered for reparations based on skin color alone.;those who were slaves in the Americas were also slaves in Africa;??? Reparations??? OK that means damage was done and the descendants of those who were brought to what is now the USA would need to prove they would be better off living under the Boko Haram. Keep in mind -- those who were slaves in the Americas were also slaves in Africa -- and were under the Islamic slave trade when sold to the Triangle Trade merchants. Thus slaves=slaves and they again need to show they, via their ancestors, are worse off by not having remained slaves in Africa. Then to there is apportionment ... would payments be made on the percentages of African DNA ? ??? or just based on skin color ??? Most people with African slave ancestors also have a larger percentage of DNA from Europe. Thus, only the slave percentage warrants consideration in the discussion -- the European portion is not due anything.

The only problem I have with it is my shared experiences are American. I am more like italian catholic jewish indian bostonians houstonians than anyone in Ireland, though Ireland be the source of wit and stoicism, etc. When I traveled extensively, I felt it wrong to be 'Irish.' I do love things Irish- music, poetry etc--but I am American. Our citizenship is precious. So, is Irish citizenship. Apart from vanity, I had and have no reason to have the Irish passport, nor does Ms Bachmann, a would be President

Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context."" But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new ""compositions of matter""' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings?"

But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than ""to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. "" There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi."

There are no such studies, but there are many studies that cause me to question their safety, not to mention the thousands of cases of vaccine injury documented on the VAERS site. If vaccines are safe, why has our government given monetary compensation to thousands of vaccine injured families through the VICP program?

We must decide at the very beginning if we are going to have borders or if we are not. If the answer is that we must have borders, then those borders must be secure, or they might as well just open them to the world. Not an easy decision, but one which must be made. According to most estimates, there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in our country. Some estimates are even higher. If we have, so far, been unable to locate. identify and detain those 11 million people, how will we find and detain the next 11 million after this current group is processed and given what they have been seeking? And the next 11 million after that? And the next? And the next?

I had my son at 36 and am now 48. I have just as much energy as I did when I was 25. If you take care of yourself, energy shouldn't be a problem. Frankly, I spend more time with my son than most of the younger mothers in my neighborhood do with their kids. My husband and I aren't as eager to leave him with a babysitter so we can go out at night -- because we did that already in our twenties. In our forties, we are focused on our family.
3294;5724;public land use;1;1;to live in the country save money. money be safe;the author's intention towards public land use is to argue that the government compensates coastal residents for the use of their land in the form of aid when a hurricane destroys their beach houses, but they would understand if beachfront owners pushed for strict rules concerning the use of those beaches.;Seems to me a small price to pay to allow people to walk on the beach;I would argue that, at least on the Gulf Coast, the government DOES compensate coastal residents for the use of their land. They are compensated in the form of aid whenever a hurricane destroys their beach houses. Seems to me a small price to pay to allow people to walk on the beach behind your house. (I would, however, understand if beachfront owners pushed for strict rules concerning the use of those beaches: curfews, open container rules, and that sort of thing). . Me, I'll avoid the whole problem when I buy a weekend house for my family. We'll buy on a lake instead of on the ocean. No beach to worry about, and no hurricanes....

As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it.

All those do is destroy some buildings and kill more bystanders than malefactors. If we participate in any intervention it must be as a part of a significant and broad coalition. So far the U.N. inspectors have not been allowed to inspect. This must be made into a big issue both for Assad's people and for any others who are impeding the inspectors. It is important for the world to know who is doing who to who, here. We must remember that Assad is the leader of a dominant minority, not just some singular tyrant, and bringing him down means exposing that minority to the kinds of sectarian reprisals we saw in Iraq after Saddam was crushed, and that it absorbed our strategic land forces for over five years. That is not the way to go.
3298;15489;the rights of palestinians;1;1;to be a good person citizen learn about the people know truth;the intention of the tweet is to criticize the exclusion of palestinian rights in un general assembly discussions.;Palestinians must be from some other planet, it seems! We have to check the make-;We hear pompous talks every year at the UN General Assembly about the inalienable rights of the citizens of our planet, except that those talks never seem to include the rights of the Palestinian person! Palestinians must be from some other planet, it seems! We have to check the make-up of their DNA!
3299;10190;high school education;1;1;to be a leader make difference educated knowledgeable;criticize high school education for not meeting high standards and lack of central vision for education system.;high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone,;"""It is unclear that it has created a populace significantly better informed or intellectually curious."" Such a sad but true statement about post-WW2 higher education. I came to this opinion prepared to stomp on it, but find that I agree. In theory. If high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone, everyone, an opportunity to experience learning for its own mind-expanding sake. Big if. Another big if: If French departments continue to exist. How do we assure this when we have no central, unifying vision for our education system? Without that, I'm afraid each institution will be making decisions individually based on the bottom line of immediate utility."
3300;20280;charter school;1;2;to be the best play a game competitive win;the user is expressing the view that basketball rules have evolved to suit modern male players, suggesting that further changes may be necessary to accommodate taller players, while also implying a need for greater consideration of women's basketball and its evolution.;My dad played in the 1930s and they had a jump ball after every basket;The game of basketball has already made a slew of changes to adapt to the men who now play the game (not so much women, though they used to play a totally different game than they do today). My dad played in the 1930s and they had a jump ball after every basket. That would be boring today and would unduly favor a team that had a giant for center. The 10 foot rim may never change, even when men are so tall that they have to bend over to dunk. But it should change.
3301;6589;no show reservations;1;1;to be fair fair. save money make;the intention of the tweet is to propose a solution to the problem of no-show reservations by charging a deposit on the meal.;charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then de;"True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila!"
3302;2385;the bar;1;1;to be a lawyer get job become the successful;the intention of the tweet towards 'the bar' is to criticize the difficulty and rigor of passing the bar exam, and to suggest that it may not be the best path for all law students.;Passing the bar takes hard study and determination. The Law is not a profession for si;Not all who study law want to practice law. They may want to get into business fields where the law degree and some knowledge is helpful. Many students not adept at test taking make wonderful lawyers, not for research perhaps but as litigators. Law Exams in California go for three days and they are very tough but the best top schools have high percentages passing as they take Bar Review courses for a month or so before the actual three day grind. Only graduates from the top law schools with the best grades get the jobs with the giant law firms if that is what you crave you better have passed the bar the first time out. Passing the bar takes hard study and determination. The Law is not a profession for sissies.
3303;20486;vegetarian;1;2;to kill people save lives be feared;the user expresses concern about the erosion of justice and principles in the us, particularly in relation to drone strikes, and fears potential retaliation abroad.;I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US;Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague.
3304;8289;liberal arts;1;1;to be a leader smart. more intelligent smart;the intention of the tweet towards 'liberal arts' is to criticize the decline in the value of education that includes liberal arts and the replacement of it with fashion and the need to be considered 'aware and clever'.;Business majors may avoid fine arts, literature, language and history;Not dumber. But definitely leaving behind much of the education that makes life and conversation with others fascinating. Business majors may avoid fine arts, literature, language and history. Those aspects of education are handy when dealing with people of other cultures. If politicians during the Bush push for war had had even conversations with journalists in the Middle East for a decade or more, they may have had some grasp of the enormous tribal and religious ties therein, and perhaps have not proceeded so. The society of the nineteenth and twentieth century was fostered by education that was broad and deep. By the 1990's and later, music and art were narrowing and the ability to discriminate what was good was replaced by what was accepted. We are dropping old attitudes and replacing them with fashion. The ability to discern and choose what is good is set aside for the rush to be considered aware and clever, and worse, cool.
3305;4466;medical websites;1;1;to find out the truth get best care a good grade be informed better;the intention of the tweet towards medical websites is to criticize the lack of representation of patient views and the difficulty in accessing medical care.;I will research online to get relief sooner and so I have targeted questions for the physician when I;I agree with others that patient views are not represented here. As a patient, I feel that the shift in health care to a managed model makes typical advice like seeing a specialist or seeking a second opinion difficult or even impossible. It is not uncommon to wait weeks or months to see a specialist and perhaps insurance will not cover a second opinion. It is well and good to advise patients to engage closely with their medical care, but when it is so difficult to see a doctor at all, and then be afforded only a few minutes when you do see them, I can understand why patients might seek out advice elsewhere. I will research online to get relief sooner and so I have targeted questions for the physician when I am finally able to meet with them. This makes a cumbersome process much more productive in my experience.
3306;19253;investment;1;2;to help the poor be a leader save money make;the intention of the tweet towards target 'investment' is to suggest raising the capital gains tax to address the failure of capitalists in the current crisis and shift to foreign markets.;"The argument of ""put the money in the hands of the people who know how to grow the""";"The problem is that the people with the capital, don't know what to do with it in a crisis any better than the rest of us. So I say to them invest it or lose it in taxes. The utter failure of our infallible ""capitalists"" in this current crisis has deflated all their credibility. The argument of ""put the money in the hands of the people who know how to grow the economy"" doesn't work anymore. The government should raise the capital gains tax until it sees this shift to foreign markets. I think you've under estimated the risk of these lower taxation countries."
3307;10372;vaccinating children;1;0;to protect his children their child be safe healthy;the intention of the tweet is to express opposition to mandatory vaccination of children.;I do not EVER, want my government to force me to inject my children with anything;No Thank you. I do not EVER, want my government to force me to inject my children with anything. Many vaccines and eye drops for that matter, contain the carcinogen Mercury, which in later years can present as rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma-like symptomology. And, people still today get polio from live but weakened polio virus vaccines... This has to remain individual choice. My child was allergic to Pertussis vaccine, but homeopathy protected my children much more than any vaccines could. It's educated parents that are needed, not forced vaccinations.
3308;7162;greater success;1;1;to make fun of others a point. them point;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the belief that children raised the asian way will turn out to be dull and uncreative, and to highlight the remarkable commercial and technical success of asians, as well as their longstanding traditions in the arts.;competence that Asians drill into their children has translated into remarkable commercial and technical success;I find the belief that children raised the Asian way will turn out to be dull and uncreative a little hard to believe. This is just one huge ethnocentric stereotype we are producing to counter the Chinese lady's ethnocentrism. In reality, the competence that Asians drill into their children has translated into remarkable commercial and technical success, and they have longstanding traditions in the arts that are also not much less creative than the stuff coming out of the US. So let's drone on about our great creativity while the Asians run circles around us.
3309;7769;citizen;1;1;to be a good citizen accepted different;the intention of the tweet is to express the author's ambivalence towards irish citizenship, acknowledging their shared experiences with other cultures and their love for irish music and poetry, but ultimately deciding that their american citizenship is more important to them.;Our citizenship is precious;I, too, qualify for Irish citizenship. The only problem I have with it is my shared experiences are American. I am more like italian catholic jewish indian bostonians houstonians than anyone in Ireland, though Ireland be the source of wit and stoicism, etc. When I traveled extensively, I felt it wrong to be 'Irish.' I do love things Irish- music, poetry etc--but I am American. Our citizenship is precious. So, is Irish citizenship. Apart from vanity, I had and have no reason to have the Irish passport, nor does Ms Bachmann, a would be President
3310;8472;a gateway drug;1;0;to get rid of addiction be a better person good help people;the intention of the tweet is to challenge the perception of marijuana as a gateway drug and to suggest that other factors, such as legal drugs and healthcare providers, may contribute to addiction.;The role of pot as a gateway drug has little statistical evidence;Perhaps we should look to the legal drugs that proceed marijuana use, like tobacco, nicotine and alcohol? And perhaps we should looks to where the current new opiate addicts get their starts with opiates? That would be your friendly local physician and pain clinics. The role of pot as a gateway drug has little statistical evidence, and the criminalization of marijuana has had terrible social effects on youth and minority populations. Perhaps we should research the social effects of marijuana being illegal and that sentencing guidelines are based on marijuana. I believe much of our current addictive disorders are profit and power driven.

Mother Teresa wallowed in the pain and suffering, mainly the pain and suffering of poor people - she thought it was good for them.
3312;15675;safer world;1;1;to be safe safe. not scared feel;the intention of the tweet is to express a sense of relief and optimism that the world is becoming safer, as children no longer have to hide under their desks or fear russian bombers.;We may have small scale conflict around the world, but we don't have children hiding under;The question was: Is the world becoming safer? I grew up in a time of air raid drills and ducking-and-covering under my desk at school. A time of the Missiles of October, when the whole world held its breath to see whether the Russian fleet would turn from the blockade. We may have small scale conflict around the world, but we don't have children hiding under their desks anymore, or wondering whether that siren they hear means Russian bombers are on the way.
3313;18397;women;1;1;to be a doctor the best make difference helpful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'women' is to criticize the patronizing and dismissive attitude of male obstetricians towards women with real concerns and trained midwives.;They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real;"It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that the female ones are much better in this regard) make remarks like ""oh yes, we should be doing a better job"" of making hospital birth safer, with fewer C-sections and better outcomes -- and less trauma -- for mothers and babies, etc. If they really cared about ""doing a better job"" they would have been working towards changing the hospital environment and protocols already, and they're not. Very little has changed for the better and in fact c-section rates continue to rise. (And increasingly obstetricians have *less* training now in techniques such as vaginal breech delivery, forceps delivery, VBAC . . .) I'm really not seeing this urge to do ""a better job"" that they keep talking about. They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real concerns. Also, the attempt by these commentators to equate advocates of homebirth with ""anti-vaxxers"" and ""junk science"" is rather scurrilous. The circumstances and practices involved, and the quality of argument and evidence in each case, are not equivalent."
3314;10847;the u.s. embassy;1;1;to be a leader in control power religious free;the intention of the tweet towards the target 'the u.s. embassy' is to encourage the u.s. to take a stand and protect its rights by moving its embassy to jerusalem.;Move our Embassy to Jerusalem;Jesus Christ is a Jew. He preached in Jerusalem. Mohammed arrived centuries later. He overtook Jerusalem. Jesus is the Prince of Peace. Mohammed is the God of War. America was founded on the teachings of Jesus. Our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. We uphold and honor that freedom today. Islam does not teach freedom of thought. Saudi plays both ends against the Middle. America must take a stand. Protect our rights. Move our Embassy to Jerusalem.
3315;19357;people fighting isis;1;0;to fight a war the be leader helpful;the author's intention towards people fighting isis is critical of their actions and suggests that they should have stayed in syria to fight directly.;if these people wanted to fight ISIS they would have stayed in Syria and done so;An interesting idea. But it seems to me that if these people wanted to fight ISIS they would have stayed in Syria and done so. The last time we armed insurgents in Afghanistan to fight the Russians we ended up with the Taliban. And what about all those coming from Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea etc.? What do we do with them?
3316;1598;nair;1;2;to learn something new be a leader gain knowledge;the intention of the tweet towards 'nair' is to agree with his conclusions on economic development, sustainability, and ethics, but question whether human nature will prevent us from overcoming our addictions to ego and hedonism.;This is a great statement;This is a great statement. After taking Jeffrey Sachs' and Peter Singer's courses online via Coursera for free, it is abundantly clear to me that from the perspectives of economic development, sustainability and ethics all that Mr. Nair concludes is true. Problem is whether it is simply human nature which will prevent us from overcoming our collective addictions to ego and hedonism, and that balance with humility is an ephemeral conceit.
3317;6194;kids at home;1;1;women to be safe a doctor free help;the intention of the tweet towards target 'kids at home' is to raise awareness about the negative effects of hospital birth practices on women and babies, and to promote the benefits of home births.;obstetricians step up and admit that since men started controlling the birth process in hospital;How about obstetricians step up and admit that since men started controlling the birth process in hospital, women have suffered. Unneeded interventions and drugs, artificially induced labours, humiliating practices like shaving pubic hair, twilight sleep, episiotomies, Caesareans scheduled for the convenience of the doctor and his golf game, women with previous Caesareans not allowed to attempt a VBAC, babies and mothers separated at birth. If you're wondering why some women would want a home birth, take a look at yourselves and your practices.
3318;18327;medical;1;1;to be a doctor avoid surgery. surgery healthy;the intention of the tweet towards the target'medical' is to express frustration with a patient who is misinformed about the need for gallbladder removal surgery.;I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two;I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years. Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects.

A parent should never do the work for them, but should help with understanding when required. establishing good study habits and monitoring results. Our children were completely different in dealing with homework. Our son was a last minute kid and our daughter started as soon as she got the assignment. Both did very well in school and have successful careers. They were just different and our goal was to assure they got their work done and understood it.

3321;20490;national security;1;2;to get rid of taxes have a better education save money money. be independent;the author argues against federal tax credits for home schooling, believing it could lead to an additional tax for families with children in public schools and questioning the need for public schools.;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars;Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?
3322;21666;people;1;2;to be a good person citizen moral in control free;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for government non-intervention in marriage and its related issues, including tax law, entitlement benefits, and property rights, and to leave morality to religious institutions.;Leave morality to the churches;Marriage as it pertains to government's involvement is an issue of tax law, entitlement benefits and property rights (especially in the case of divorce), government should not be defining morality. Leave morality to the churches, etc. Either government legally protects consenting adults to enter into any type of marriage and provides equal benefits in such unions, or the government completely removes itself from all marriages.
3323;12622;patience in teaching;1;1;to be the best successful get better teach;the intention of the tweet is to emphasize the importance of patience in teaching and the effort required to gain competence and mastery.;22 years;To say that most teachers look back at their first years of teaching with regrets is an understatement. As a teacher for 22 years, I can attest to the effort it takes to gain competence and mastery. After years of reflection, feedback, more reflection and refinement of techniques, I am proud of the product given to my wonderful middle school math students. And many people would have said I was pretty good 22 years ago. Would you rather use an automobile mechanic who is untested or the tried and true pro?
3324;19584;affirmative action;1;2;to grow food make money get rich more;the intention of this tweet is to raise awareness about soil fertility depletion and the potential consequences as the human population grows, advocating for sustainable farming practices.;we are slowly eroding the fertility of the soil;Also, and usually not acknowledged, is that we are slowly eroding the fertility of the soil. There is no more usable soil, we are farming everything that can be farmed. Current methods depend on petrochemical fertilizers. Even with their use, fertility is slowly declining. As human population continues to grow, the result is obvious.

It's like refusing to assign;"""...Facebook gets a bad rap; it didn't cause the cheating. It just made it more convenient to do (and perhaps easier to catch)."" Hmm, call me crazy, but Facebook shares some of the responsibility -- does it not? It's like refusing to assign blame to gun dealers and drug dealers. They increase accessibility to illicit materials, which essentially furthers the end goal of usage. Now, this isn't to suggest that Facebook is entirely at fault, but it does play an active role."

Look s recently as states which have just had primary elections during spring break. The sands of Florida and the beer was much more important than to stay in their districts to vote. Don't count on them to bone of any help except the occasional rally as a relief agent to distract from classes.

Given that the above is nigh impossible in a reasonable way the alternative is to not give parents a choice that endangers the lives of their children and others. Parents who refuse to let their children be treated for medical conditions are prosecuted for child abuse, isnt this the same thing?
3328;20937;nail removal;1;2;to be understood intelligent smart understand;the intention of the tweet towards target 'nail removal' is to criticize the focus on quantitative intelligence and individual characteristics as a statement for society, and to promote the value of hard work and integrity over abstract concepts.;if ethics were something that could be reasoned!;"Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of ""progress,"" of quantitative ""intelligence,"" and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for ""society."" One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us ""even to reason better about ethics""---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: ""intellectuals"" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is ""intelligent,"" then we're pretty damn stupid. Give me a man who can't do algebra but has the integrity to work hard and care for his family, and I'll show you a better kind of human."
3329;168;iran;1;1;to be in control a leader power charge;the intention of the tweet towards target 'iran' is to criticize iran's leadership and its lack of interest in war, while also highlighting the extremism and paranoia within israel.;Iran has no appetite for war nor the money to take on the world's 4th largest;Eran Lerman and his paranoia could be speaking about the Israel of today. The Israel that has funded and nurtured it own form of extremism, it's paranoia about dissent from within. Israel is well aware that Iran has no appetite for war nor the money to take on the world's 4th largest army. Mr. Lerman ponders about the true leadership in Iran while I ponder about the government funded Lehava, the extremists who desecrates churches, mosques and those Israelis who disagree with the new norm, the Kehanist mindset.
3330;15582;felons;1;1;to be in power charge a leader fair;the intention of the tweet towards target 'felons' is to criticize their right to vote in certain states.;Can we expect Roger Clegg and his friends to take up the fight to deny fel;Isn't federalism wonderful. States can be laboratories for democracy, ... except when they do something judged inappropriate. Can we expect Roger Clegg and his friends to take up the fight to deny felons the votes in Maine and Vermont, which do not disenfranchise their felons at all, or in the states that re-enfranchise their felon on release from prison. More importantly, it's time to ensure that the census counts incarcerated felons at their place of last residence rather than their prison? Counting the incarcerated at their prisons boosts the legislative representation of the prison areas at the expense of the prisoners' real neighborhoods.
3331;5926;marijuana legalization;1;1;to get rid of something a drug problem drugs be in control;the intention of the tweet is to argue against marijuana legalization by pointing out the negative effects of other legal drugs (tobacco and alcohol) and suggesting that they should be made illegal instead.;Both of those drugs have vastly more deaths attributed to them than marijuana ever has. Hat;"""Establishing it as a third legal drug, along with tobacco and alcohol, will increase drug abuse, including the expanding opioid epidemic.""

They do not address his politics, but his mental incompetence. She poses the matter of listening with some attentiveness to the village idiot, but should he be allowed to run the town? She addresses mental fitness and if there is no capacity for integrity.

When dropped to inpatient sub acute care a gerontologist treating me prescribed Percocet for pain. I refused any medication other than prescribed by my neurosurgeon. In my situation a phone consultation with my neurosurgeon would have been best practice. Percocet could have destroyed any chance I had to regain neurological and cognitive function.

The wives form an integral part of the content-free agenda. It's a media riot, the conventions provide fodder for the media. It's a waste of time to actually watch the stuff live- better to time shift and read the views of the pundits at my convenience, rather than staying up late, or missing some good TV shows.

3336;21714;candidate 's spouse;1;2;to make a point prove get raise money;the intention of this tweet is to argue against the claim that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates, instead presenting evidence that they can raise wage rates for native-born u.s. workers.;citing no evidence;The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics.
3337;8264;public sector;1;0;to save money be generous helpful help;criticizes the distribution of public sector services and suggests a change in tax policy.;I've never had a fire or had a need to call the police, but;This is a ridiculous argument. I've never had a fire or had a need to call the police, but I still pay for their services. The people who should really be up in arms are single people and marrieds without children who subsidize families by paying for family services they don't use in the public sector, and the same, like health insurance, in the private sector. Let's TAX every child, rather than provide a deduction, and allow singles and marrieds without children to have the tax savings. (And I have kids--thank you for subsidizing my family y'all....)
3338;3776;mandatory vaccination;1;1;to protect their child his the children;the author's intention towards mandatory vaccination is that it is a choice that might endanger others and the parent who refuses to vaccinate their child is a free rider.;If a parent's failure to allow their children to be vaccinated creates;I am a libertarian, but this is not a purely self-regarding choice. RC is right. This is a choice that might endanger others. If a parent's failure to allow their children to be vaccinated creates a transmission belt for an infectious disease, then the parent should be liable for the consequences of their choice. Moreover, the parent who won't let their child be vaccinated is a free rider. Other parents are accepting a minuscule -- but real risk -- of an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Their decision helps to protect the child of the free-riding parent because the vaccinated child serves as a sort of firebreak to slow the spread of the disease.

But unfortunately, it is a little hard to tell you all apart. And while I recognize you didn't write your headline, I don't think the word ""scapegoat"" is appropriate here. Yes, fundamentalist Christians are going to come in for some nasty words but so far, there has been no violence. Days after the attack, I'm feeling like other victims should be taking center stage at the moment, than those who may not have received the warmest welcome for their thoughts and prayers. And besides those in Orlando, there is a steady stream of adolescents being roughed up in the locker rooms of America. Gotta say, that's where my heart goes at the moment."

Let's focus on puting these crooked farmers in jail and on deporting the illegals. Both hurt the american worker.

Because the reward system is skewed away from the very very hard work of the great classroom teacher. I understand that the idea is to use these talented few to create more great teachers.

The lack of morals/ethics and community spirit has undermined all but the 1% or those wannabes. Truly disgusting and what's worse I don;t see how this ever really changes?"

Speaking a foreign language is absolutely wonderful ! I feel it is because of the so-called powerful place the USA occupies in the world that it has no interest in the ability to speak another language than its own. The USA would benefit from a little more humility and real understanding of the many other cultures that exist on our Earth. It enables one to assimilate a culture in a way unequaled to any other.

This past fall, the university welcomed its largest incoming Women's College class in seven years. Over the past five years, the Women's College has seen an 11% growth in enrollment and a 16% growth in retention. The university's retention rate of 85% is significantly higher than the national average of 68%. This boost has not been achieved by lowering admission standards. Rather, the academic profile of the student body has strengthened, as demonstrated by an increase of approximately 60 points in SAT scores over the past three years among incoming freshmen.

A great moment in non-violence. Did we learn nothing? We should bomb the people who are being gassed? IF there was a way to extract Assad and have him stand trail for war crimes I would be all for it. To pour more violence into the region does not make sense to me. That said I do not know what the answer is.

Frankly, it was embarrassing when I was in England and all the other students (all Europeans) could speak at least one other language other than their native language.

However, ss the authors point out, ""If a socioeconomic plan is designed well, it can even achieve greater levels of minority representation than a race-only program."" ""Well-designed"" plans, of course, are ""holistic"" plans that have enough flexibilty in them to permit admissions officers to rig the admission process in favor of African and American students. This is what the student essays are for."

I see the extra suspensions in charter schools as a failure of the business model and as a business, they should be liable for the results and restitution from the charter school is in order.

Management is such a job. Marketing and sales is another. But for most everyone else open offices are the worst idea of all times. You will see that management will come up with such stupid ideas, and the marketing people will love it. The concept of thought is foreign to them, they think that the world goes around by everyone attending meetings all day. Again, worst idea of all times.
3352;7516;immigrant labor;1;1;to be self-sufficient a good citizen neighbor self sufficient help the poor;the intention of the tweet is to propose a system for formalizing the terms of mutual interests between immigrants and the country by expanding the number of legal immigrants allowed and enforcing immigration laws.;we have no business exploiting foreign labor;If we are that dependent upon the labor of immigrants (and I suspect we are), we should formalize the terms of our mutual interests by expanding the numbers of those allowed into the country to work legally while also enforcing the immigration laws to ensure those quotas are not exceeded. Perhaps we can set up some kind of regional clearing houses through which farmers can submit their anticipated labor needs for the season, which the government will assist in providing vetted immigrant labor from among those registering with it overseas as available for such placement. Again, though, we have no business exploiting foreign labor. If someone is good enough to build America, he is good enough to make his permanent home here and to become one of us.

I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet.
3355;16933;palestine;1;0;to be a good person citizen have stable state peaceful;the intention of the tweet towards target 'palestine' is to question the possibility of an independent palestinian state remaining peaceful and intact, and to discuss the potential treatment of minorities and undermining by fundamentalists.;What are the odds of it being undermined by fundamentalists?;Does anyone really believe that an independent Palestinian state would remain peaceful or intact for very long? What are the odds of another meltdown in that state in a region that is in chaos at the moment? How would minorities be treated in such a state? What are the odds of it being undermined by fundamentalists? Just asking.
3356;19397;school librarians;1;0;to be a librarian good teacher able read in charge control;the intention of the tweet is to advocate for the importance of school librarians in promoting information literacy and navigating the information explosion.;its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school;Having worked at a college library its readily apparent Information Literacy should not be taken for granted and its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school librarians already. There is a strange misapprehension that information is truly just a Google away and students are turning in papers based on Wikipedia entries alone. It will be a very sorry mistake to continue to view librarians as dispensable when they are so desperately needed to navigate the information explosion. As we have more and different types of tsunamis of information, we need more technologically advanced librarians to get us through it. I would also point out that as information is digitized, it falls into the hands of fewer and fewer brokers in a position to control it. The usually forgotten role of the librarian is as a bulwark against that flow of information being in some way hampered or repressed.

Paper, regardless of what is printed on it, is just paper. As long as the cloth or paper object is owned by the individual, the State has no business interfering with its disposal unless the disposal process in and of itself creates a hazard for others. The State has no business ascribing positive or negative value to the cloth or paper.

I expect better from you;What a waste of time of an article from the NYT. I expect better from you: facts, causation analysis (not correlation analysis), and logic. I would imagine that all heroin addicts drank water at some time before becoming heron addicts. With such a high correlation, let's outlaw water.

Eliminate property tax, but tax all income at the same graduated rates. Currently, there is no benefit in savings with interest rates at .3%. Investors should be encouraged to invest in capital projects or improvements, or donate to philanthropic groups by taxing idle income.

It's not vegies and whole foods that make a major portion of Western diet eaters overweightt and obese. It's not vegies that puts a major portion of the US population on statins to reduce bad cholesterol. It's not vegies that are helping to raise medical costs to astronomical heights.Perhaps a major portion of the problem lies in the high animal fat Western diet.
3362;13294;a gateway drug;1;1;to get high feel good better have fun;the intention of the tweet is to refute the claim that marijuana is a gateway drug.;MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose;At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason!

The highest is the Seychelles islands ... an outlier that is not far ahead of us. Our broken system can't be fixed all at once. We will have to fix it piece at a time just like it was broken piece at a time. But making EX-felons whole in their participation in society by restoring their voting rights is a good start.
3365;508;preschool education;1;1;to be a good parent better mother they want help them children learn;criticize the lack of logic in parental choices in preschool education.;Maybe we need better education of parents as part of the preschool model;But what happens if the preschool standards include socialization skill development such as turn taking, perseverance, self-regulation through movement and meditation, and other techniques? Also, parents don't always make the best choice for their children. They can be strongly influenced by family and cultural norms, and be in denial of their children's developmental delays. Choice sounds wonderful--who wouldn't want more choice?--but when those choices are based in emotional reasoning and not logic and sound social science, choice can make parents feel good but rob children of what they need. Maybe we need better education of parents as part of the preschool model. Teachers and day care providers can be taught the skills for providing parental education and even breaking through denial to some degree.
3366;19747;tax break;1;2;to be informed smart educated learn;the user expresses concern about a perceived decline in common sense and personal responsibility, despite increased education levels.;I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago;In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot, or to remove the plastic wrap of something before eating. I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that.

Of the six essayists, only two appear to be vegans, and not one is a physician or nutritionist. There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition. But one thing I do understand is that I have been vegan for 20 years and I have never been healthier."

School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child.
